Empirical analysis of corporate tax reforms: What is the null and where did it come from?,"Absent theoretical guidance, empiricists have been forced to rely upon numerical comparative statics from constant tax rate models in formulating testable implications of tradeoff theory in the context of natural experiments. We fill the theoretical void by solving in closed-form a dynamic tradeoff theoretic model in which corporate taxes follow a Markov process with exogenous rate changes. We simulate ideal difference-in-differences estimations, finding that constant tax rate models offer poor guidance regarding testable implications. While constant rate models predict large symmetric responses to rate changes, our model with stochastic tax rates predicts small, asymmetric, and often statistically insignificant responses. Even with very long regimes (one decade), under plausible parameterizations, the true underlying theory—that taxes matter—is incorrectly rejected in about half the simulated natural experiments. Moreover, tax response coefficients are actually smaller in simulated economies with larger tax-induced welfare losses.","['Christopher A. Hennessy', 'Akitada Kasahara', 'Ilya A.

Leveraged buyouts and bond credit spreads,"Recent decades have witnessed several waves of buyout activity. We find leveraged buyouts (LBOs) to be a significant concern for bondholders by showing that a) intra-industry credit spreads increase upon an LBO announcement, b) yields on bonds without event risk covenants are, on average, 21 basis points higher than those on same-firm bonds with such covenants, and c) structural models calibrated to historical LBO events imply an impact of 18–21 basis points on 10-year credit spreads. The impact is strongest in expansion periods and for bonds with maturities of 10–20 years.","['Yael Eisenthal-Berkovitz', 'Peter Feldhütter', 'Vikrant Vig']","['Credit spreads', 'LBO risk', 'Structural models', 'Leveraged buyouts']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301801,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,3,Yael Eisenthal-Berkovitz,2020,169.97114190294786
Do fire sales create externalities?,"We develop three novel measures of the incentives of equity mutual funds to internalize the price impact of their trading. We show that mutual funds with stronger incentives to internalize their price impact accommodate inflows and outflows by adjusting their cash buffers instead of trading in portfolio securities. As a result, stocks held by these funds have lower volatility, and flows out of these funds have smaller spillover effects on other funds holding the same securities. Our results provide evidence of meaningful fire sale externalities in the equity mutual fund industry.","['Sergey Chernenko', 'Adi Sunderam']","['Fire sales', 'Liquidity management', 'Mutual funds']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301928,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,3,Sergey Chernenko,2020,169.97114190294786
Betting against correlation: Testing theories of the low-risk effect,"We test whether the low-risk effect is driven by leverage constraints and, thus, risk should be measured using beta versus behavioral effects and, thus, risk should be measured by idiosyncratic risk. Beta depends on volatility and correlation, with only volatility related to idiosyncratic risk. We introduce a new betting against correlation (BAC) factor that is particularly suited to differentiate between leverage constraints and behavioral explanations. BAC produces strong performance in the US and internationally, supporting leverage constraint theories. Similarly, we construct the new factor SMAX to isolate lottery demand, which also produces positive returns. Consistent with both leverage and lottery theories contributing to the low-risk effect, we find that BAC is related to margin debt while idiosyncratic risk factors are related to sentiment.","['Cliff Asness', 'Andrea Frazzini', 'Niels Joachim Gormsen', 'Lasse Heje Pedersen']","['Asset pricing', 'Leverage constraints', 'Lottery demand', 'Margin', 'Sentiment']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930176X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,3,Cliff Asness,2020,169.97114190294786
Are early stage investors biased against women?,"We study whether early stage investors have gender biases using a proprietary data set from AngelList that allows us to observe private interactions between investors and fundraising startups. We find that male investors express less interest in female entrepreneurs compared to observably similar male entrepreneurs. In contrast, female investors express more interest in female entrepreneurs. These findings do not appear to be driven by within-gender screening/monitoring advantages or gender differences in risk preferences. Moreover, the male-led startups that male investors express interest in do not outperform the female-led startups they express interest in—they underperform. Overall, the evidence is consistent with gender biases.","['Michael Ewens', 'Richard R.

Employment effects of unconventional monetary policy: Evidence from QE,"This paper investigates employment effects of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing policies (QE) via a bank lending channel. We find that banks with higher mortgage-backed securities holdings refinanced relatively more mortgages after the first round of QE, which increased local consumption and employment in the nontradable goods sector. In contrast, banks increased lending to firms and home purchase mortgage origination after the third round of QE, which led to a sizable increase in overall employment. Our findings are supported by new confidential loan-level data that show firms with stronger ties to affected banks increased employment and capital investment more during QE3.","['Stephan Luck', 'Tom Zimmermann']","['Bank lending channel', 'Quantitative easing']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301771,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,3,Stephan Luck,2020,169.97114190294786
Governance through shame and aspiration: Index creation and corporate behavior,"After decades of de-prioritizing shareholders’ economic interests and low corporate profitability, Japan introduced the JPX-Nikkei400 in 2014. The index highlighted the country’s “best-run” companies by annually selecting the 400 most profitable of its large and liquid firms. We find that managers competed for inclusion in the index by significantly increasing return on equity (ROE), and they did so at least in part due to their reputational or status concerns. The ROE increase was predominantly driven by improvements in margins, which were in turn partially driven by cutting research and development (R&D) intensity. Our findings suggest that indexes can affect managerial behavior through reputational or status incentives.","['Akash Chattopadhyay', 'Matthew D. Shaffer', 'Charles C.Y.

"Left-tail momentum: Underreaction to bad news, costly arbitrage and equity returns","This paper documents a significantly negative cross-sectional relation between left-tail risk and future returns on individual stocks trading in the US and international countries. We provide a behavioral explanation to this anomaly based on the idea that investors underestimate the persistence in left-tail risk and overprice stocks with large recent losses. Thus, low returns in the left-tail of the distribution persist into the future causing left-tail return momentum. We find that the left-tail risk anomaly is stronger for stocks that are more likely to be held by retail investors, that receive less investor attention, and that are costlier to arbitrage.","['Yigit Atilgan', 'Turan G.

Pricing structured products with economic covariates,We introduce a top-down no-arbitrage model for pricing structured products. Losses are described by Cox processes whose intensities depend on economic variables. The model provides economic insight into the impact of structured products on financial institutions’ risk exposure and systemic risk. We estimate the model using CDO data and find that spreads decrease with higher interest rates and increase with volatility and leverage. Volatility is the primary determinant of variation in tranche spreads. Leverage and interest rates are more closely associated with rare credit events. Model-implied risk premiums and the probabilities of tranche losses increase substantially during the financial crisis.,"['Yong Seok Choi', 'Hitesh Doshi', 'Kris Jacobs', 'Stuart M.

Time series momentum: Is it there?,"Time series momentum (TSM) refers to the predictability of the past 12-month return on the next one-month return and is the focus of several recent influential studies. This paper shows that asset-by-asset time series regressions reveal little evidence of TSM, both in- and out-of-sample. While the t-statistic in a pooled regression appears large, it is not statistically reliable as it is less than the critical values of parametric and nonparametric bootstraps. From an investment perspective, the TSM strategy is profitable, but its performance is virtually the same as that of a similar strategy that is based on historical sample mean and does not require predictability. Overall, the evidence on TSM is weak, particularly for the large cross section of assets.","['Dashan Huang', 'Jiangyuan Li', 'Liyao Wang', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Time series momentum', 'Risk premium', 'Return predictability', 'Pooled regression']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301953,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,3,Dashan Huang,2020,169.97114190294786
A comparison of some structural models of private information arrival,"We show that the PIN and the Duarte and Young (2009) (APIN) models do not match the variability of noise trade in the data and that this limitation has severe implications for how these models identify private information. We examine two alternatives to these models, the Generalized PIN model (GPIN) and the Odders-White and Ready (2008) model (OWR). Our tests indicate that measures of private information based on the OWR and GPIN models are promising alternatives to the APIN’s Adj.PIN and PIN.","['Jefferson Duarte', 'Edwin Hu', 'Lance Young']","['Liquidity','Information asymmetry']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301965,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,3,Jefferson Duarte,2020,169.97114190294786
Portfolio rebalancing in general equilibrium,"This paper develops an overlapping generations model of optimal rebalancing where agents differ in age and risk tolerance. Equilibrium rebalancing is driven by a leverage effect that influences levered and unlevered agents in opposite directions, an aggregate risk tolerance effect that depends on the distribution of wealth, and an intertemporal hedging effect. After a negative macroeconomic shock, relatively risk-tolerant investors sell risky assets, while more risk-averse investors buy them. Owing to interactions of leverage and changing wealth, however, all agents have higher exposure to aggregate risk after a negative macroeconomic shock and lower exposure after a positive shock.","['Miles S.

Shrinking the cross-section,"We construct a robust stochastic discount factor (SDF) summarizing the joint explanatory power of a large number of cross-sectional stock return predictors. Our method achieves robust out-of-sample performance in this high-dimensional setting by imposing an economically motivated prior on SDF coefficients that shrinks contributions of low-variance principal components of the candidate characteristics-based factors. We find that characteristics-sparse SDFs formed from a few such factors—e.g., the four- or five-factor models in the recent literature—cannot adequately summarize the cross-section of expected stock returns. However, an SDF formed from a small number of principal components performs well.","['Serhiy Kozak', 'Stefan Nagel', 'Shrihari Santosh']","['Factor models','SDF','Cross section','Shrinkage','Machine learning']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301655,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,2,Serhiy Kozak,2020,169.97114190294786
Trading and arbitrage in cryptocurrency markets,"Cryptocurrency markets exhibit periods of large, recurrent arbitrage opportunities across exchanges. These price deviations are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of capital controls for the movement of arbitrage capital. Price deviations across countries co-move and open up in times of large bitcoin appreciation. Countries with higher bitcoin premia over the US bitcoin price see widening arbitrage deviations when bitcoin appreciates. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common and an idiosyncratic component. The common component explains 80% of bitcoin returns. The idiosyncratic components help explain arbitrage spreads between exchanges.","['Igor Makarov', 'Antoinette Schoar']","['Cryptocurrencies', 'Bitcoin', 'Arbitrage', 'Price impact', 'Capital controls']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301746,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,2,Igor Makarov,2020,169.97114190294786
Show me the money: The monetary policy risk premium,"We create a parsimonious monetary policy exposure (MPE) index based on observable firm characteristics that previous studies link to how stocks react to monetary policy. Our index successfully captures stocks’ responses to both conventional and unconventional monetary policy. Stocks whose prices react more positively to expansionary monetary policy (high-MPE stocks) earn lower average returns. This result is consistent with the notion that high-MPE stocks provide a hedge against bad economic shocks, to which the Federal Reserve responds with expansionary monetary policy. A long-short trading strategy designed to exploit this effect achieves an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 0.77.","['Ali Ozdagli', 'Mihail Velikov']","['Monetary policy', 'Asset pricing', 'Risk factors']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301709,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,2,Ali Ozdagli,2020,169.97114190294786
Quantify the quantitative easing: Impact on bonds and corporate debt issuance,"This paper studies the impact of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Corporate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP) announcement on prices, liquidity, and debt issuance in the European corporate bond market using a data set on bond transactions from Euroclear. I find that the quantitative easing (QE) programme increased prices and liquidity of bonds eligible to be purchased substantially. Bond yields dropped on average by 30 basis points (bps) (8%) after the CSPP announcement. Tri-party repo turnover rose by 8.15 million USD (29%), and bilateral turnover went up by 7.05 million USD (72%). Bid-ask spreads also showed significant liquidity improvement in eligible bonds. QE was successful in boosting corporate debt issuance. Firms issued 2.19 billion EUR (25%) more in QE-eligible debt after the CSPP announcement, compared to other types of debt. Surprisingly, corporates used the attracted funds mostly to increase dividends. These effects were more pronounced for longer-maturity, lower-rated bonds, and for more credit-constrained, lower-rated firms.",['Karamfil Todorov'],"['Quantitative easing', 'Corporate Sector Purchase Programme', 'ECB', 'Bond market', 'Corporate debt issuance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301941,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,2,Karamfil Todorov,2020,169.97114190294786
Trading out of sight: An analysis of cross-trading in mutual fund families,"This paper explores how mutual fund groups set the price of in-house transactions among affiliated funds. We collect a data set of four million equity transactions and compare the pricing of trades crossed internally (cross-trades) with that of twin trades executed with external counterparties. While cross-trades should reduce transaction costs for both trading parties, we find that the price of cross-trades is set strategically to reallocate performance among sibling funds. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a large number of cross-trades are backdated. We discuss the implications for the literature on fund performance and the current regulatory debate.","['Alexander Eisele', 'Tamara Nefedova', 'Gianpaolo Parise', 'Kim Peijnenburg']","['Mutual fund families', 'Cross-trades', 'Monitoring', 'Backdating', 'Transfer pricing']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301734,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,2,Alexander Eisele,2020,169.97114190294786
An ill wind? Terrorist attacks and CEO compensation,"Using multiple measures of attack proximity, we show that CEOs employed at firms located near terrorist attacks earn an average pay increase of 12% after the attack relative to CEOs at firms located far from attacks. CEOs at terrorist attack-proximate firms prefer cash-based compensation increases (e.g., salary and bonus) over equity-based compensation (e.g., options and stocks granted). The effect is causal and it is larger when the bargaining power of the CEO is high. Other executives and workers do not receive a terrorist attack premium.","['Yunhao Dai', 'P.

Measuring skewness premia,"We provide a new methodology to empirically investigate the respective roles of systematic and idiosyncratic skewness in explaining expected stock returns. Using a large number of predictors, we forecast the cross-sectional ranks of systematic and idiosyncratic skewness, which are easier to predict than their actual values. Compared to other measures of ex ante systematic skewness, our forecasts create a significant spread in ex post systematic skewness. A predicted systematic skewness risk factor carries a significant and robust risk premium that ranges from 6% to 12% per year. In contrast, the role of idiosyncratic skewness in pricing stocks is less robust.",['Hugues Langlois'],"['Systematic skewness', 'Coskewness', 'Idiosyncratic skewness', 'Large panel regression', 'Forecasting']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930159X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,2,Hugues Langlois,2020,169.97114190294786
Reputations and credit ratings: Evidence from commercial mortgage-backed securities,"How do changes in a rating agency's reputation affect the ratings market? We study the dynamics of credit ratings after Standard & Poor's (S&P) was shut out of a large segment of the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) ratings market following a procedural mistake. Exploiting the fact that most CMBS have ratings from multiple agencies, we show that S&P subsequently eased its standards compared to other raters. This coincided with a partial recovery in the number of deals S&P was hired to rate. Our findings suggest that an agency can regain market share after suffering reputational damage by issuing optimistic ratings.","['Ramin P.

Financing dies in darkness? The impact of newspaper closures on public finance,"We examine how local newspaper closures affect public finance outcomes for local governments. Following a newspaper closure, municipal borrowing costs increase by 5–11 basis points, costing the municipality an additional $650,000 per issue. This effect is causal and not driven by underlying economic conditions. The loss of government monitoring resulting from a closure is associated with higher government wages and deficits and increased likelihoods of costly advance refundings and negotiated sales. Overall, our results indicate that local newspapers hold their governments accountable, keeping municipal borrowing costs low and ultimately saving local taxpayers money.","['Pengjie Gao', 'Chang Lee', 'Dermot Murphy']","['Media', 'Monitoring', 'Public finance', 'Municipal bonds']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301606,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,2,Pengjie Gao,2020,169.97114190294786

This difference disappears when comparing short-term municipal bonds, implying the market prices climate change risks for long-term securities only.

Institutional shareholders and corporate social responsibility,"This study uses two distinct quasi-natural experiments to examine the effect of institutional shareholders on corporate social responsibility (CSR). We first find that an exogenous increase in institutional holding caused by Russell Index reconstitutions improves portfolio firms’ CSR performance. We then find that firms have lower CSR ratings when shareholders are distracted due to exogenous shocks. Moreover, the effect of institutional ownership is stronger in CSR categories that are financially material. Furthermore, we show that institutional shareholders influence CSR through CSR-related proposals.

Inventor CEOs,"One in five U.S. high-technology firms are led by CEOs with hands-on innovation experience as inventors. Firms led by “Inventor CEOs” are associated with higher quality innovation, especially when the CEO is a high-impact inventor.

Is information risk priced? Evidence from abnormal idiosyncratic volatility,"We propose a new, price-based measure of information risk called abnormal idiosyncratic volatility (AIV) that captures information asymmetry faced by uninformed investors. AIV is the idiosyncratic volatility prior to information events in excess of normal levels. Using earnings announcements as information events, we show that AIV is positively associated with informed return run-ups, abnormal insider trading, short selling, and institutional trading during pre-earnings-announcement periods. We find that stocks with high AIV earn economically and statistically larger future returns than stocks with low AIV. Taken together, our findings support the notion that information risk is priced.","['Yung Chiang Yang', 'Bohui Zhang', 'Chu Zhang']","['Information risk', 'Idiosyncratic volatility', 'Earnings announcement', 'Expected returns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301710,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,2,Yung Chiang Yang,2020,169.97114190294786
Dynamic interventions and informational linkages,"We model a dynamic economy with strategic complementarity among investors and study how endogenous government interventions mitigate coordination failures.

A stronger initial intervention helps subsequent interventions through increasing the likelihood of positive news, but also leads to negative conditional updates. Our results suggest optimal policy should emphasize initial interventions when coordination outcomes tend to correlate. Neglecting informational externalities of initial interventions results in over- or under-interventions. Moreover, saving smaller funds disproportionally more can generate greater informational benefits at smaller costs.","['Lin William Cong', 'Steven R.

Providing liquidity in an illiquid market: Dealer behavior in US corporate bonds,"We examine market making behavior of dealers for 55,988 corporate bonds, many of which trade infrequently. Dealers have a substantially higher propensity to offset trades within the same day rather than committing capital for longer periods for riskier and less actively traded bonds. Dealers’ holding periods do not decline with a bond's prior trading activity and in fact are lowest for some of the least active bonds. As a result, cross-sectional estimates of roundtrip trading costs do not increase as prior trading activity declines. Our results suggest that dealers endogenously adjust their behavior to mitigate inventory risk from trading in illiquid and higher risk securities, balancing search and inventory costs in equilibrium such that observed spreads can appear invariant to expected liquidity.","['Michael A.

The job rating game: Revolving doors and analyst incentives,"Investment banks frequently hire analysts from rating agencies. While many argue that this “revolving door” creates captured analysts, it can also create incentives to improve accuracy. To study this issue, I construct an original data set, linking analysts to their career paths and the securitized finance ratings they issue. First, I show that accurate analysts are more frequently hired by underwriting investment banks. Second, I exploit two distinct sources of variation in the likelihood of being hired by a bank. Both indicate that, as this likelihood rises, analyst accuracy improves.

Potential pilot problems: Treatment spillovers in financial regulatory experiments,"The total effects of a regulatory change consist of direct effects and indirect effects (spillovers), but the standard difference-in-difference approach mostly ignores potential indirect effects. During the 2007 full repeal of the uptick rule, short-sellers become much more aggressive across the board, even in control stocks where the uptick rule is already suspended.

Idea sharing and the performance of mutual funds,"I develop an equilibrium model to explain why few mutual fund managers consistently outperform, even though many have strong informational advantages. The key ingredient is that managers obtain investment ideas through idea sharing. Idea sharing improves statistical significance of alpha through increased price informativeness. But it also causes better informed managers to take larger positions, which makes their alpha noisier—although a significant fraction of managers builds strong informational advantages, statistical significance and persistence of alpha concentrate in underperforming funds. I argue that in-house development of ideas cannot explain these facts.",['Julien Cujean'],"['Idea sharing', 'Performance', 'Rational-expectations equilibrium']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301400,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,1,Julien Cujean,2020,169.97114190294786
Squaring venture capital valuations with reality,"We develop a valuation model for venture capital–backed companies and apply it to 135 US unicorns, that is, private companies with reported valuations above $1 billion. We value unicorns using financial terms from legal filings and find that reported unicorn post-money valuations average 48% above fair value, with 14 being more than 100% above. Reported valuations assume that all shares are as valuable as the most recently issued preferred shares. We calculate values for each share class, which yields lower valuations because most unicorns gave recent investors major protections such as initial public offering (IPO) return guarantees (15%), vetoes over down-IPOs (24%), or seniority to all other investors (30%). Common shares lack all such protections and are 56% overvalued. After adjusting for these valuation-inflating terms, almost one-half (65 out of 135) of unicorns lose their unicorn status.","['Will Gornall', 'Ilya A.

Exchanges of innovation resources inside venture capital portfolios,"I explore the prevalence of exchanges of innovation resources inside venture capital portfolios. I show that after companies join investors’ portfolios, several proxies of exchanges between them and portfolio companies (relative to matched nonportfolio companies) increase by an average of 60%. The increase holds when joining events are plausibly exogenous and when VCs’ bargaining power and potential conflicts of interest are low. Three novel mechanisms are supported: carve-outs, spawning, and recycling, whereby entrepreneurs divest innovation units, start new ventures, and reuse assets in other portfolio companies, respectively. Results suggest that returns to innovation are higher in venture capital portfolios.",['Juanita González-Uribe'],"['Venture capital portfolios', 'Innovation resources', 'State pension funds']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301424,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,1,Juanita González-Uribe,2020,169.97114190294786
How do venture capitalists make decisions?,"We survey 885 institutional venture capitalists (VCs) at 681 firms to learn how they make decisions. Using the framework in Kaplan and Strömberg (2001), we provide detailed information on VCs’ practices in pre-investment screening (sourcing evaluating and selecting investments), in structuring investments, and in post-investment monitoring and advising. In selecting investments, VCs see the management team as somewhat more important than business-related characteristics such as product or technology although there is meaningful cross-sectional variation across company stage and industry. VCs also attribute the ultimate investment success or failure more to the team than to the business. While deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment value-added all contribute to value creation, the VCs rate deal selection as the most important of the three. We compare our results to those for chief financial officers (Graham and Harvey, 2001) and private equity investors (Gompers et al., 2016a).","['Paul A. Gompers', 'Will Gornall', 'Steven N.

"Shorting flows, public disclosure, and market efficiency","Shorting flows remain a significant predictor of negative future stock returns during 2010–2015, when daily short-sale volume data are published in real time. This predictability decays slowly and lasts for a year. Long-term shorting flows are more informative than short-term shorting flows. Indeed, abnormal short-term shorting flows do not predict future returns or anticipate bad news. We find that short sellers exploit prominent anomalies. A comparison with the Regulation SHO data indicates that the predictability is much shorter-term during 2005–2007. Short sellers appear to have shifted from trading on short-term private information to trading on long-term public information that is gradually incorporated into prices.","['Xue Wang', 'Xuemin\xa0(Sterling) Yan', 'Lingling Zheng']","['Short sale', 'Public disclosure', 'Return predictability', 'Anomalies']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301436,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,1,Xue Wang,2020,169.97114190294786

"Earnings, retained earnings, and book-to-market in the cross section of expected returns","Book value of equity consists of two economically different components: retained earnings and contributed capital. We predict that book-to-market strategies work because the retained earnings component of the book value of equity includes the accumulation and, hence, the averaging of past earnings. Retained earnings-to-market predicts the cross section of average returns in U.S. and international data and subsumes book-to-market. Contributed capital-to-market has no predictive power. We show that retained earnings-to-market, and, by extension, book-to-market, predicts returns because it is a good proxy for underlying earnings yield (Ball, 1978; Berk, 1995) and not because book value represents intrinsic value.","['Ray Ball', 'Joseph Gerakos', 'Juhani T.

Time to build and the real-options channel of residential investment,"A standard real-options model predicts that time-to-build investment could be delayed by uncertainty over future revenue. We quantify the first-order importance of this mechanism in the 2002–2011 housing boom-bust cycle by developing and estimating a model of sequential irreversible investment with stochastic bottlenecks. We find that the main driver of construction delays during the boom is construction bottlenecks. However, further delay in construction during the bust is caused by an increase in uncertainty, which grew by 21.6% between 2002 and 2009. The model can account for more than one-third of the decline in residential investment between 2002 and 2009.","['Hyunseung Oh', 'Chamna Yoon']","['Investment', 'Housing', 'Real options']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301722,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,135,1,Hyunseung Oh,2020,169.97114190294786
Does size matter? Bailouts with large and small banks,"We explore how large and small banks make funding decisions when system-wide bailouts are possible. We show that bank size, purely on strategic grounds, is a key determinant of banks� leverage choices, even when bailout policies treat large and small banks symmetrically. Large banks leverage more than small banks because they internalize that their decisions directly affect bailout policies. In equilibrium, this effect is amplified by strategic spillovers to small banks since banks� leverage choices are strategic complements. Overall, the presence of large banks makes bailouts more likely. The optimal regulation features size-dependent policies that disproportionately restrict large banks� leverage.","['Eduardo D�vila', 'Ansgar Walther']","['Bailouts','Bank regulation','Too big to fail','Too many to fail','Size tax']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302247,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,1,Eduardo D�vila,2020,169.97114190294786
Is the active fund management industry concentrated enough?,"We introduce a theoretical model of the active fund management industry (AFMI) in which performance and size depend on the AFMI's competitiveness (concentration). Under plausible assumptions, as AFMI's concentration decreases, so do fund managers� incentives for exerting effort in search of alpha. Consequently, managers produce lower gross alpha, and rational investors, inferring lower expected AFMI performance, allocate a smaller portion of their wealth to active funds. Empirically, we find that a decrease in the US mutual fund industry concentration over our sample period is associated with a decrease in its net alpha and size (relative to stock market capitalization).","['David Feldman', 'Konark Saxena', 'Jingrui Xu']","['Active fund management','Market concentration','Effort','Industry size','Alpha']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302132,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,1,David Feldman,2020,169.97114190294786
Adverse selection and the performance of private equity co-investments,"Investors increasingly look for private equity managers to provide opportunities for co-investing outside the fund structure, thereby saving fees and carried interest payments.

In contrast to Fang, Ivashina, and Lerner (2015), we find no evidence of adverse selection. Gross return distributions of co-investments and other deals are similar. Co-investments generally have lower costs to investors.

We use this predictability to construct a diversified cross-asset time series momentum portfolio that yields a Sharpe ratio 45% higher than a standard time series momentum portfolio.

OTC premia,"Using unique data at transaction and identity levels, we provide the first systematic study of interest rate swaps traded over the counter (OTC). We find substantial and persistent heterogeneity in derivative prices consistent with a pass-through of regulatory costs on to market prices via so-called valuation adjustments (XVA). A client pays a higher price to buy interest rate protection from a dealer (i.e., the client pays a higher fixed rate) if the contract is not cleared via a central counterparty. This OTC premium decreases by posting initial margins and with higher buyer�s creditworthiness. OTC premia are absent for dealers suggesting bargaining power.","['Gino Cenedese', 'Angelo Ranaldo', 'Michalis Vasios']","['Interest rate swaps','Financial regulation','Central clearing','Over-the-counter market','Valuation adjustments']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X19302296,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,1,Gino Cenedese,2020,169.97114190294786

There is no evidence that management of those firms subsequently altered firm policies in its interest. Investment, employment, wages, profitability, and capital structure remain unchanged.

Families with competitive incentives generate higher performing funds, a higher fraction of �star� funds, but greater performance dispersion across funds.

Why do option returns change sign from day to night?,"Average delta hedged returns for Standard & Poor's 500 index options are large: ?0.7% per day. When we decompose these option returns into intraday and overnight components, average close-to-open returns are ?1% per day and open-to-close returns are positive, 0.3%. A similar return pattern holds for all maturity and moneyness categories and equity options. These positive intraday returns are particularly difficult to explain. However, our results are consistent with option prices� failing to account for the well-known fact that stock volatility is substantially higher intraday than overnight. These findings help explain price formation in the options market.","['Dmitriy Muravyev', 'Xuechuan (Charles) Ni']","['Option returns','Volatility seasonality','Behavioral finance','Intraday data']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302193,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,1,Dmitriy Muravyev,2020,169.97114190294786

The term structure of realized spreads (price impact) is sharply downward (upward) sloping, implying that (a) market maker profitability is sensitive to speed, and (b) the choice of the horizon of measurement is critical when drawing inferences from spread decompositions. The majority of the price impact of trades in large (small)-capitalization stocks takes place within 15 (60) seconds. Net profits to liquidity provision, or equivalently, net costs to liquidity demanders, decline over the sample period even at the shortest horizons that we consider: at the 100 ms horizon, aggregate profits decline from 1.9 basis points of total dollar volume in 2010 to 1.0 basis points in 2017.","['Jennifer Conrad', 'Sunil Wahal']","['Liquidity','Market microstructure','Trading','High frequency trading']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302272,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,1,Jennifer Conrad,2020,169.97114190294786

We provide direct evidence of one channel through which stock price informativeness affects productivity; specifically, we find that CEO turnover is less sensitive to Tobin's q when informativeness is lower. We predict and confirm that the productivity of smaller and younger firms, better governed firms, more specialized firms, and firms with more competition is more strongly related to the informativeness of their stock price. We further address endogeneity concerns with the use of brokerage closures, S&P 500 additions, and mutual fund redemptions as plausibly exogenous events.","['Benjamin Bennett', 'Ren� Stulz', 'Zexi Wang']","['Stock price informativeness','TFP','Firm efficiency']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302259,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,2,Benjamin Bennett,2020,169.97114190294786

Households� preferences for liquid assets imply a liquidity premium on deposits. The banking sector supplies deposits and has excessive risk-taking incentives.

A higher capital requirement also increases banks� monitoring incentives, which improves the efficiency of banks� activities.

Mutual fund investments in private firms,"Historically, a key advantage of being a public firm was broader access to capital, from a disperse group of shareholders. In recent years, such capital has increasingly become available to private firms as well. We document a dramatic increase over the past twenty years in the number of mutual funds participating in private markets and in the dollar value of these private firm investments. We evaluate several factors that potentially contribute to this trend: firms seeking extra capital to postpone public listing, mutual funds seeking higher risk-adjusted returns and initial public offering (IPO) allocations, and venture capitalists (VCs) seeking new investors to substantiate higher valuations.

I can see clearly now: The impact of disclosure requirements on 401(k) fees,"In 2012, the US Department of Labor imposed new disclosure requirements for indirect fees that 401(k) retirement plan service providers earn through revenue sharing agreements with mutual funds. This paper examines the impact of these fee disclosure requirements on the level and structure of fees paid by retirement plans, as well as service providers� ability to price discriminate between plan sponsors of different sophistication. We document that the new disclosure requirements are associated with a substitution of direct fees for indirect fees and a reduction in total fees paid by smaller plans, and that mutual fund providers responded by introducing retirement fund share classes with lower 12b-1 fees.","['Dominique C.

Risky bank guarantees,"Applying standard portfolio-sort techniques to bank asset returns for 15 countries from 2004 to 2018, we uncover a risk premium associated with implicit government guarantees. This risk premium is intimately tied to sovereign risk, suggesting that guaranteed banks, defined as those of particular importance to the national economy, inherit the risk of the guarantor. Indeed, this premium does not exist in safe-haven countries. We rationalize these findings with a model in which implicit government guarantees are risky in the sense that they provide protection that depends on the aggregate state of the economy.","['Taneli M�kinen', 'Lucio Sarno', 'Gabriele Zinna']","['Banks','Sovereign risk','Risk premium','Government guarantee']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X1930251X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,2,Taneli M�kinen,2020,169.97114190294786
Medicaid and household savings behavior: New evidence from tax refunds,"Using data on over 57,000 low-income tax filers, we estimate the effect of Medicaid access on the propensity of households to save or repay debt from their tax refunds. We instrument for Medicaid access using variation in state eligibility rules. We find substanital heterogeneity across households in the savings response to Medicaid. Households that are not experiencing financial hardship behave in a manner consistent with a precautionary savings model, meaning they save less under Medicaid. In contrast, among households experiencing financial hardship, Medicaid eligibility increases refund savings rates by roughly 5 percentage points or $102. For both sets of households, effects are stronger in states with lower bankruptcy exemption limits�consistent with uninsured, financially constrained households using bankruptcy to manage health expenditure risk. Our results imply that expansions to the social safety net may affect the magnitude of the consumption response to tax rebates.","['Emily A.

Do dividends convey information about future earnings?,"Yes. We show that dividend changes contain information about highly persistent changes in future economic income. Three methodological differences lead us to different conclusions from the extant literature: (i) we use an �event window approach� to cleanly delineate earnings after dividend changes from those before, (ii) we use alternative earnings measures to control for endogenous investment and asset write-downs surrounding dividend changes, and (iii) we control for the nonlinear relation between dividend changes and market reactions. Our results suggest dividend announcement returns reflect information about the level of permanent earnings, though the timing of the information content is difficult to reconcile with traditional signaling models.","['Charles G.

Democracy and credit,"Does democratization reduce the cost of credit? Using global syndicated loan data from 1984 to 2014, we find that democratization has a sizable negative effect on loan spreads: a 1-point increase in the zero-to-ten Polity IV index of democracy shaves at least 19 basis points off spreads, but likely more. Reversals to autocracy hike spreads more strongly. Our findings are robust to the comprehensive inclusion of relevant controls, to the instrumentation with regional waves of democratization, and to a battery of other sensitivity tests. We thus highlight the lower cost of loans as one relevant mechanism through which democratization can affect economic development.","['Manthos D.

Investor experiences and financial market dynamics,"How do macrofinancial shocks affect investor behavior and market dynamics? Recent evidence on experience effects suggests a long-lasting influence of personally experienced outcomes on investor beliefs and investment but also significant differences across older and younger generations. We formalize experience-based learning in an overlapping generations (OLG) model, where different cross-cohort experiences generate persistent heterogeneity in beliefs, portfolio choices, and trade. The model allows us to characterize a novel link between investor demographics and the dependence of prices on past dividends while also generating known features of asset prices, such as excess volatility and return predictability. The model produces new implications for the cross-section of asset holdings, trade volume, and investors� heterogeneous responses to crises, which we show to be in line with the data.","['Ulrike Malmendier', 'Demian Pouzo', 'Victoria Vanasco']","['Experience effects','Learning','Asset prices','Portfolio choice','Demographics']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302703,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,3,Ulrike Malmendier,2020,169.97114190294786
Locked in by leverage: Job search during the housing crisis,"This paper examines how housing market distress affects job search. Using data from a leading online job search platform during the Great Recession, we find that job seekers in areas with depressed housing markets apply for fewer jobs that require relocation. With their search constrained geographically, job seekers broaden their search for lower-level positions nearby. These effects are stronger for job seekers with recourse mortgages, which we confirm using a spatial regression discontinuity analysis.

Shared analyst coverage: Unifying momentum spillover effects,"Identifying firm connections by shared analyst coverage, we find that a connected-firm (CF) momentum factor generates a monthly alpha of 1.68% (t?=?9.67). In spanning regressions, the alphas of industry, geographic, customer, customer/supplier industry, single- to multi-segment, and technology momentum factors are insignificant/negative after controlling for CF momentum. Similar results hold in cross-sectional regressions and in developed international markets. Sell-side analysts incorporate news about linked firms sluggishly. These effects are stronger for complex and indirect linkages.

This paper quantifies the magnitude of these frictions among participants in new venture competitions. In a regression discontinuity design with data from 87 competitions, winning a round increases the chances of external financing by about 35%. Winning is most impactful for ventures that are ranked just above the cutoff but receive no cash prize, and judge ranks strongly predict venture success. The results indicate that these information problems in new venture finance are large, and competitions can help resolve them through certification.",['Sabrina T.

Blockholder voting,"Blockholders play a large role in corporate governance. We examine their voting behavior by adding a voter with many votes, i.e., a blockholder, to a standard voting model. A blockholder may not vote with all of her shares. This is efficient because it prevents her from drowning out the information in others� votes. This effect holds even when shares may be traded. Consequently, regulations prohibiting abstention will harm information aggregation, though such regulations may promote information acquisition by blockholders. We extend the model by allowing: the blockholder to announce her information upfront, the possibility of blockholder bias, and asymmetric priors.","['Heski Bar-Isaac', 'Joel Shapiro']","['Blockholder','Shareholder voting','Corporate governance']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302843,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,3,Heski Bar-Isaac,2020,169.97114190294786
Agency conflicts and short- versus long-termism in corporate policies,"We build a dynamic agency model in which the agent controls both current earnings via short-term investment and firm growth via long-term investment. Under the optimal contract, agency conflicts can induce short- and long-term investment levels beyond first best, leading to short- or long-termism in corporate policies. The paper analytically shows how firm characteristics shape the optimal contract and the horizon of corporate policies, thereby generating a number of novel empirical predictions on the optimality of short- versus long-termism. It also demonstrates that combining short- and long-term agency conflicts naturally leads to asymmetric pay-for-performance in managerial contracts.","['Sebastian Gryglewicz', 'Simon Mayer', 'Erwan Morellec']","['Optimal short- and long-termism','Agency conflicts','Multitasking']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302909,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,3,Sebastian Gryglewicz,2020,169.97114190294786

We show that, besides its social benefits, capital regulation benefits bank shareholders when it resolves fire sales externalities but not when it acts as a tax on bank profits such as when used to control excessive leverage induced by deposit insurance. Furthermore, capital regulation widens the gap between the returns to bank shareholders and depositors and may reduce investments in projects in favor of storage.","['Elena Carletti', 'Robert Marquez', 'Silvio Petriconi']","['Limited market participation','Bank capital structure','Capital regulation','Investor returns']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302892,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,3,Elena Carletti,2020,169.97114190294786

Private money creation with safe assets and term premia,"The existing literature has shown that an increase in the demand for safe assets induces the private sector to create more of them. Focusing on repos backed by US Treasuries, I theoretically and empirically show that an increase in the demand for safe assets leads to a decrease in repos outstanding. Because Treasuries are safe assets, an increase in the demand for safe assets compresses their term premia, reducing incentives to issue repos. Thus, the sensitivity of private safe asset creation depends on whether the collateral backing them are safe assets themselves.

Managerial control benefits and takeover market efficiency,"How and to what extent do managerial control benefits shape the efficiency of the takeover market? We revisit this question by estimating both the dark and bright sides of managerial control benefits in an industry equilibrium model. On the dark side, managers� private benefits of control distort firms� takeover incentives and hinder the reallocation role of the takeover market. On the bright side, fear of a takeover induces underperforming managers to exert more effort and enhances the disciplinary role of the takeover market. Our estimates suggest that the bright-side effect increases the value created by an active takeover market by 21%, comparable in magnitude to the dark-side effect. It is also important to account for this bright-side effect in explaining certain features of the takeover market, including a low takeover-performance sensitivity.","['Wenyu Wang', 'Yufeng Wu']","['Mergers and acquisitions','Private benefits of control','Structural estimation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X1930282X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,136,3,Wenyu Wang,2020,169.97114190294786

Dancing with activists,"An important milestone often reached in the life of an activist engagement is entering into a �settlement� agreement between the activist and the target's board. Using a comprehensive hand-collected data set, we analyze the drivers, nature, and consequences of such settlement agreements. Settlements are more likely when the activist has a credible threat to win board seats in a proxy fight and when incumbents� reputation concerns are stronger. Consistent with incomplete contracting, face-saving benefits, and private information considerations, settlements commonly do not contract directly on operational or leadership changes sought by the activist but rather on board composition changes. Settlements are accompanied by positive stock price reactions, and they are subsequently followed by changes of the type sought by activists, including CEO turnover, higher shareholder payouts, and improved operating performance. We find no evidence to support concerns that settlements enable activists to extract rents at the expense of other investors. Our analysis provides a look into the �black box� of activist engagements and contributes to understanding how activism brings about changes in target companies.","['Lucian A.

The financing of local government in China: Stimulus loan wanes and shadow banking waxes,"The upsurge of shadow banking is typically driven by rising financing demand from certain real sectors. In China, the 4 trillion yuan stimulus package in 2009 was behind the rapid growth of shadow banking after 2012, expediting the development of Chinese corporate bond markets in the poststimulus period. Chinese local governments financed the stimulus through bank loans in 2009 and then resorted to nonbank debt financing after 2012 when faced with rollover pressure from bank debt coming due. Cross-sectionally, using a political-economy-based instrument, we show that provinces with greater bank loan growth in 2009 experienced more municipal corporate bond issuance during 2012�2015, together with more shadow banking activities including trustloans and wealth management products.

Off-balance sheet funding thus gives the bank flexibility to voluntarily support debt repayments when the investment fails, which allows the bank to signal information about the quality of its future projects, improving investment efficiency.

We find positive abnormal returns on SEP pricing dates for which issuers benefit from altering closing stock prices but no such returns on pricing dates of otherwise similar SEPs. We also show that large buy trades near the close of trading are more frequent when SEP issuers have incentives to alter closing stock prices.","['Brian J. Henderson', 'Neil D.

Who's paying attention? Measuring common ownership and its impact on managerial incentives,"We derive a measure that captures the extent to which common ownership shifts managers� incentives to internalize externalities. A key feature of the measure is that it allows for the possibility that not all investors are attentive to whether a manager's actions benefit the investor's overall portfolio. Empirically, we show that potential drivers of common ownership, including mergers in the asset management industry and, under certain circumstances, even indexing, could diminish managerial motives to internalize externalities.

Short-term debt and incentives for risk-taking,"We challenge the view that short-term debt curbs moral hazard and demonstrate that, in a world with financing frictions and fair debt pricing, short-term debt generates incentives for risk-taking. To do so, we develop a model in which firms are financed with equity and short-term debt and cannot freely optimize their default decision because of financing frictions. We show that when firms are close to distress, the dynamic interaction of operating and rollover losses fuels default risk. In such instances, shareholders find it optimal to increase asset risk to improve interim debt repricing and prevent inefficient liquidation. These risk-taking incentives do not arise when debt maturity is sufficiently long.","['Marco Della Seta', 'Erwan Morellec', 'Francesca Zucchi']","['Short-term debt financing','Rollover risk','Risk-taking','Financing frictions']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300155,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,137,1,Marco Della Seta,2020,169.97114190294786

The persistent effect of initial success: Evidence from venture capital,"We use investment-level data to study performance persistence in venture capital (VC). Consistent with prior studies, we find that each additional initial public offering (IPO) among a VC firm�s first ten investments predicts as much as an 8% higher IPO rate on its subsequent investments, though this effect erodes with time. In exploring its sources, we document several additional facts: successful outcomes stem in large part from investing in the right places at the right times; VC firms do not persist in their ability to choose the right places and times to invest; but early success does lead to investing in later rounds and in larger syndicates.

Concentration of control rights in leveraged loan syndicates,"We find that corporate loan contracts frequently concentrate control rights with a subset of lenders. Despite the rise in term loans without financial covenants�so-called covenant-lite loans�borrowing firms� revolving lines of credit almost always retain traditional financial covenants. This split structure gives revolving lenders the exclusive right and ability to monitor and to renegotiate the financial covenants, and we confirm that loans with split control rights are still subject to the discipline of financial covenants. We provide evidence that split control rights are designed to mitigate bargaining frictions that have arisen with the entry of nonbank lenders and became apparent during the financial crisis.","['Mitchell Berlin', 'Greg Nini', 'Edison G.

Mood beta and seasonalities in stock returns,"Existing research has found cross-sectional seasonality of stock returns�the periodic outperformance of certain stocks during the same calendar months or weekdays. We hypothesize that assets� different sensitivities to investor mood explain these effects and imply other seasonalities. Consistent with our hypotheses, relative performance across individual stocks or portfolios during past high or low mood months and weekdays tends to recur in periods with congruent mood and reverse in periods with noncongruent mood. Furthermore, assets with higher sensitivities to aggregate mood�higher mood betas�subsequently earn higher returns during ascending mood periods and earn lower returns during descending mood periods.","['David Hirshleifer', 'Danling Jiang', 'Yuting Meng DiGiovanni']","['Return seasonality','Investor mood','Mood beta','Market efficiency','Anomalies']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300362,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,137,1,David Hirshleifer,2020,169.97114190294786
Is the credit spread puzzle a myth?,"We revisit Feldh�tter and Schaefer (FS, 2018), who report evidence of a �credit spread puzzle� for high-yield but not investment-grade bonds. We show their results are reversed when their model is calibrated to market values of debt (as required by theory) rather than book values. We then demonstrate that using credit spreads rather than historical default rates to identify the default boundary provides the statistical power necessary to reject their assumption that firm dynamics follow geometric Brownian motion. A large market price of jump risk is required to match historical default rates, which generates a credit spread puzzle for investment-grade but not high-yield bonds.","['Jennie Bai', 'Robert S.

Cheap-stock tunneling around preemptive rights,"Preemptive rights are thought to protect minority shareholders from cheap-stock tunneling by a controlling shareholder. We show that preemptive rights, while making cheap-stock tunneling more difficult, cannot prevent it when asymmetric information about the value of the offered shares makes it impossible for the minority to know whether these shares are cheap or overpriced. Our analysis can help explain why sophisticated investors in unlisted firms and regulators of listed firms do not rely entirely on preemptive rights to address cheap-stock tunneling, supplementing them with other restrictions on equity issues.","['Jesse M.

The connected hedge funds make abnormally large trades in the stocks of borrowing firms prior to loan announcements, and these trades outperform other trades. The outperformance is particularly strong for trades of hedge funds that have high revenue potential for prime broker banks. These informed trades appear to be based on information not just about the loan itself but also about firms� fundamentals such as future earnings.

The importance of being special: Repo markets during the crisis,"We study how the Italian sovereign bond scarcity premia, specialness, in the repo market were affected by the European Central Bank (ECB)�s purchases during the euro area sovereign debt crisis. We propose and calibrate a search-based dynamic model with a central bank acting as a buy-and-hold investor. Consistent with model predictions, ECB purchases drive specialness of targeted securities in combination with short-selling. Special benchmark bonds entail a positive cash premium, but their market liquidity decreases when purchased by the ECB. Short-sellers were more likely to fail-to-deliver very special bonds, while holders of these bonds were less inclined to pledge them as collateral to the ECB liquidity operations.","['Stefano Corradin', 'Angela Maddaloni']","['Repo','Specialness','Central bank asset purchases','Short-selling','Market liquidity and credit risk']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300398,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,137,2,Stefano Corradin,2020,169.97114190294786

Regions associated with greater credit provision to bureaucrats open more branches and receive more deposits from the local government. After staggered corruption crackdowns of provincial-level political officials, the new credit cards originated to bureaucrats in exposed regions do not enjoy a credit line premium, and bureaucrats� delinquency and reinstatement rates are similar to those of non-bureaucrats.","['Sumit Agarwal', 'Wenlan Qian', 'Amit Seru', 'Jian Zhang']","['Corruption','Credit cards','Credit','Debt','Household finance','Government','Bureaucrats','Banking','Political connections','China']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300611,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,137,2,Sumit Agarwal,2020,169.97114190294786

Institutional allocations in the primary market for corporate bonds,"Using 2002�2014 insurer transactions, we provide the first empirical evidence on underwriters� allocation practices in the primary market for corporate bonds. Since bonds are often underpriced, allocations generate for investors an estimated $41 billion of first-day profits. These profits increase with proxies for investors� information production during the bookbuilding process and, more strongly, with investors� prior trading with underwriters. Information production has a larger impact when asymmetric information is higher, while prior trading has a larger impact when the issuer-underwriter agency problem is more severe.

Tests on alternative channels further suggest that the shift in aggregate risk aversion is driven mainly by an emotional shock rather than changes in wealth or the outside environment. We also investigate possible alternate explanations for reduced flows to risky assets. Our evidence is consistent with a fear-induced increase in aggregate risk aversion.","['Albert Y.

The paradox of pledgeability,"We develop a model in which collateral serves to protect creditors from the claims of other creditors. We find that, paradoxically, borrowers rely most on collateral when pledgeability is high. This is when taking on new debt is easy, which dilutes existing creditors. Creditors thus require collateral for protection against possible dilution by collateralized debt. There is a collateral rat race. But collateralized borrowing has a cost: it encumbers assets, constraining future borrowing and investment. There is a collateral overhang. Our results suggest that policies aimed at increasing the supply of collateral can backfire, triggering an inefficient collateral rat race. Likewise, upholding the absolute priority of secured debt can exacerbate the rat race.","['Jason Roderick Donaldson', 'Denis Gromb', 'Giorgia Piacentino']","['Collateral','Secured debt','Absolute priority rule','Pledgeability']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19301199,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,137,3,Jason Roderick Donaldson,2020,169.97114190294786

CEO-board dynamics,"We examine CEO-board dynamics using a new panel dataset that spans 1920 to 2011. The long sample allows us to perform within-firm and within-CEO tests over a long horizon, many for the first time in the governance literature. Consistent with theories of bargaining or dynamic contracting, we find board independence increases at CEO turnover and falls with CEO tenure, with the decline stronger following superior performance. CEOs are also more likely to be appointed board chair as tenure increases, and we find evidence consistent with a substitution between board independence and chair duality. Other results suggest that these classes of models fail to capture important elements of board dynamics. First, the magnitude of the CEO tenure effect is economically small, much smaller, for example, than the strong persistence in board structure that we show. Second, when external CEOs are hired, board independence falls and subsequently increases. Third, event studies show a positive market reaction when powerful CEOs die in office, consistent with powerful CEOs becoming entrenched.","['John R.

This premium is directly related to the near-constant nature of FRN prices and is correlated with measures reflecting investor demand for safe assets. Money market funds are often the primary investors in FRNs, and the FRN premium is related to flows into funds with fixed net asset values, but not to flows into funds with variable net asset values. These results provide strong evidence that the FRN premium represents a convenience yield for the mark-to-market stability feature of FRNs.","['Matthias Fleckenstein', 'Francis A.

My tests exploit the staggered rejection of the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine (IDD) by US state courts as an exogenous increase in CEOs� outside opportunities. I find that the rejection of the IDD leads to a significant increase in the sensitivity of CEO pay to systematic performance (less RPE). This increase is more pronounced for CEOs with greater labor market mobility and industries where proprietary information is more important and not related to measures of governance quality.

Fiscal policy driven bond risk premia,"Fiscal policy matters for bond risk premia. Empirically, government spending level and uncertainty predict bond excess returns, as well as term structure level and slope movements. Shocks to government spending level and uncertainty are also priced in the cross-section of bond and stock portfolios. Theoretically, government spending level shocks raise inflation when marginal utility is high, thus generating positive inflation risk premia (term structure level effect). Uncertainty shocks steepen the yield curve (slope effect), producing positive term premia. These effects are consistent with evidence from a structural vector autoregression. Asset pricing tests using model simulated data corroborate our empirical findings.","['Lorenzo Bretscher', 'Alex Hsu', 'Andrea Tamoni']","['Term structure','Bond risk premia,'Fiscal policy','Uncertainty']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301252,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,1,Lorenzo Bretscher,2020,169.97114190294786
"Location choice, portfolio choice","Households hold undiversified stock portfolios of firms headquartered near their city of residence. Leading explanations assign a causal role for proximity. The literature neglects that distance is endogenous. Households may locate based on unobservables such as optimism about a city�s economic prospects, which can be correlated with latent local-stock demand. We use location-choice models to account for this selection. We propose as instruments that older households prefer to locate in recreational areas for non-pecuniary reasons. Our analysis based on a widely used household data set yields significantly smaller estimates for proximity in determining portfolio choice compared to those in the literature.","['Ioannis Branikas', 'Harrison Hong', 'Jiangmin Xu']","['Location choice','Portfolio choice','Household finance','Local bias','Selection correction']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301264,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,1,Ioannis Branikas,2020,169.97114190294786
On the performance of volatility-managed portfolios,"Using a comprehensive set of 103 equity strategies, we analyze the value of volatility-managed portfolios for real-time investors. Volatility-managed portfolios do not systematically outperform their corresponding unmanaged portfolios in direct comparisons. Consistent with Moreira and Muir (2017), volatility-managed portfolios tend to exhibit significantly positive alphas in spanning regressions. However, the trading strategies implied by these regressions are not implementable in real time, and reasonable out-of-sample versions generally earn lower certainty equivalent returns and Sharpe ratios than do simple investments in the original, unmanaged portfolios. This poor out-of-sample performance for volatility-managed portfolios stems primarily from structural instability in the underlying spanning regressions.","['Scott Cederburg', ""Michael S.

IQ from IP: Simplifying search in portfolio choice,"Using a novel database that tracks web traffic on the Security Exchange Commission's EDGAR server between 2004 and 2015, we show that institutional investors gather information on a very particular subset of firms and insiders, and their surveillance is very persistent over time. This tracking behavior has powerful implications for their portfolio choice and its information content. An institution that downloaded an insider trading filing by a given firm last quarter increases its likelihood of downloading an insider trading filing on the same firm by more than 41.3 percentage points this quarter. Moreover, the average tracked stock that an institution buys generates annualized alphas of over 12% relative to the purchase of an average non tracked stock. We find that institutional managers tend to track top executives and to share educational and locational commonalities with the specific insiders they choose to follow. Collectively, our results suggest that the information in tracked trades is important for fundamental firm value and is only revealed following the information-rich dual trading by insiders and linked institutions.","['Huaizhi Chen', 'Lauren Cohen', 'Umit Gurun', 'Dong Lou', 'Christopher Malloy']","['Tracked trades','Return predictability','Institutional trading','Insider trading']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301318,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,1,Huaizhi Chen,2020,169.97114190294786
Regulatory cooperation and foreign portfolio investment,"We investigate the effect of cross-border regulatory cooperation in the enforcement of securities laws on global-mutual-fund portfolio allocations. Our research design exploits a shock to the Securities and Exchange Commission�s oversight of foreign firms cross-listed on a US stock exchange around the signing of the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU), a non-binding, information-sharing arrangement between global securities regulators. In signatory countries, foreign investment in US-cross-listed firms increases by $110 billion relative to non-cross-listed firms. The strongest effects are for investors facing greater information asymmetries, those from countries closely linked to the US, and non-US foreign investors, suggesting significant spillover effects from international regulatory cooperation.","['Mark Lang', 'Mark Maffett', 'James D.

Can ethics be taught? Evidence from securities exams and investment adviser misconduct,"We study the consequences of a 2010 change in the investment adviser qualification exam that reallocated coverage from the rules and ethics section to the technical material section. Comparing advisers with the same employer in the same location and year, we find those passing the exam with more rules and ethics coverage are one-fourth less likely to commit misconduct. The exam change appears to affect advisers� perception of acceptable conduct and not just their awareness of specific rules or selection into the qualification. Those passing the rules and ethics-focused exam are more likely to depart employers experiencing scandals. Such departures also predict future scandals. Our paper offers the first archival evidence on how rules and ethics training affects conduct and labor market activity in the financial sector.","['Zachary T. Kowaleski', 'Andrew G.

The effect of exogenous information on voluntary disclosure and market quality,"We analyze a model in which information may be voluntarily disclosed by a firm and/or by a third party, e.g., financial analysts. Due to its strategic nature, corporate voluntary disclosure is qualitatively different from third-party disclosure. Greater analyst coverage crowds out (crowds in) corporate voluntary disclosure when analysts mostly discover information that is available (unavailable) to the firm. Nevertheless, greater analyst coverage always improves the overall quality of public information. We base this claim on two market quality measures: price efficiency, which is statistical in nature, and liquidity, which is derived in a trading stage that follows the disclosure stage.","['Sivan Frenkel', 'Ilan Guttman', 'Ilan Kremer']","['Information disclosure','Voluntary disclosure','Price efficiency','Liquidity','Analysts']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301483,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,1,Sivan Frenkel,2020,169.97114190294786
Debt collection agencies and the supply of consumer credit,"This paper finds that stricter laws regulating third-party debt collection reduce the number of third-party debt collectors, lower the recovery rates on delinquent credit card loans, and lead to a modest decrease in the openings of new revolving lines of credit. Further, stricter third-party debt collection laws are associated with fewer consumer lawsuits against third-party debt collectors but not with a reduction in the overall number of consumer complaints. Overall, stricter third-party debt collection laws appear to restrict access to new revolving credit but have an ambiguous effect on the nonpecuniary costs that the debt collection process imposes on borrowers.",['Viktar Fedaseyeu'],"['Household finance','Consumer credit','Creditor rights','Contract enforcement','Debt collection','Law and finance']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301501,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,1,Viktar Fedaseyeu,2020,169.97114190294786

We find that illiquid ETFs have large tracking errors. The effect is more pronounced when underlying assets are less liquid. Returns and liquidity of illiquid ETFs are more sensitive to underlying index returns or ETF market liquidity, or both. Thus, a positive liquidity premium exists in US ETF markets. The ETF variance could be larger than its net asst value variance owing to infrequent trading. In summary, illiquid ETFs are more likely to deviate from their underlying indexes and could be riskier than underlying portfolios.","['Kyounghun Bae', 'Daejin Kim']","['Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)','Liquidity','Tracking errors','Volatility']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301276,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,1,Kyounghun Bae,2020,169.97114190294786
The timing and consequences of seasoned equity offerings: A regression discontinuity approach,"The likelihood of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) jumps discontinuously when the stock price equals the most recent equity offer price. Anchoring on the last offer price holds after considering executive turnovers, stock splits, earnings management, or dividend adjustments. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design around this cutoff, which exploits local randomness in stock prices, we investigate the consequences of anchoring in SEOs. We find significant increases in cash holdings and acquisitions of lower quality, with no real effects on investment or employment.

How does labor market size affect firm capital structure? Evidence from large plant openings,"I examine how the labor market in which firms operate affects their capital structure decisions. Based on US Census Bureau data and information on companies� decisions to locate their new operations, I use a large plant opening as an abrupt increase in the size of a local labor market. I find that a new plant opening leads to an increase of 2.5�3.9 percentage points in the debt-to-capital ratio of existing firms in the �winner� county relative to the �runner-up� choice. This result is consistent with the argument that larger labor markets make job loss less costly, which in turn reduces the indirect costs of financial distress.

Credit and social unrest: Evidence from 1930s China,"Do credit contractions trigger social unrest? To answer this question, we turn to a natural experiment from 1930s China, where the 1933 U.S. Silver Purchase program acts as a shock to bank lending. We assemble a hand-collected data set of loan contracts between banks and firms, labor unrest episodes, and underground Communist Party penetration. The Silver Purchase shock results in a severe credit contraction, and firms borrowing from banks with a larger exposure to it experience increased labor unrest and Communist Party penetration among their workers.

Sophisticated investors and market efficiency: Evidence from a natural experiment,"We study how sophisticated investors, when faced with shocks to information environment, change their information acquisition and trading behavior, and how these changes in turn affect market efficiency. We find that, after exogenous reductions of analyst coverage due to closures and mergers of brokerage firms, hedge funds scale up information acquisition, trade more aggressively, and earn higher abnormal returns on the affected stocks. The hedge fund participation also mitigates the impairment of market efficiency caused by coverage reductions. Overall, in a causal framework, our findings suggest a substitution effect between sophisticated investors and public information providers in facilitating market efficiency.","['Yong Chen', 'Bryan Kelly', 'Wei Wu']","['Hedge funds','Information environment','Market efficiency','Information acquisition','Analyst coverage']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301719,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,2,Yong Chen,2020,169.97114190294786
Does the lack of financial stability impair the transmission of monetary policy?,"We investigate the transmission of central bank liquidity to bank deposits and loan spreads in Europe over the period from January 2006 to June 2010. We find evidence consistent with an impaired transmission channel due to bank risk. Central bank liquidity does not translate into lower loan spreads for high-risk banks for maturities beyond one year, even as it lowers deposit spreads for both high- and low-risk banks. This adversely affects the balance sheets of high-risk bank borrowers, leading to lower payouts, lower capital expenditures, and lower employment. Overall, our results suggest that banks� capital constraints at the time of an easing of monetary policy pose a challenge to the effectiveness of the bank-lending channel and the central bank's lender of last resort function.","['Viral V.

The term structure and inflation uncertainty,"To assess the importance of inflation risk for nominal Treasury yields, a novel quadratic term structure model with time-varying inflation risk is estimated using survey-based inflation uncertainty. The resulting yield decomposition captures very diverse macroeconomic dynamics of inflation and real risk premiums (large and positive during the 1980s but small and negative post-2008) and generates sensible high-frequency estimates of expected inflation and real short rates over a long sample. The explicit link between the model-implied factors and macro fundamentals reveals that short- but not long-run fluctuations are unspanned by yields, consistent with an interest rate policy unresponsive to transient inflation shocks.","['Tomas Breach', ""Stefania D�Amico"", 'Athanasios Orphanides']","['Quadratic-Gaussian term structure models','Inflation risk premium','Survey forecasts','Hidden factors']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301306,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,2,Tomas Breach,2020,169.97114190294786

Using the 2016 presidential election as a shock to political access, we find that firms with access to the Obama administration experience significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar firms.

We attribute our findings, which contrast with those found for equity funds, to funds� liquidity management strategies. Bond funds maintain significant liquidity cushions and selectively trade liquid assets, allowing them to absorb investor redemption risk without excessively liquidating corporate bonds, even during the 2008 financial crisis.","['Jaewon Choi', 'Saeid Hoseinzade', 'Sean Seunghun Shin', 'Hassan Tehranian']","['Corporate bond mutual funds','Liquidity management','Asset fire sales']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301549,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,2,Jaewon Choi,2020,169.97114190294786
Strategic trading and unobservable information acquisition,"We allow a strategic trader to choose when to acquire information about an asset�s payoff, instead of endowing her with it. When the trader dynamically controls the precision of a flow of information, the optimal precision evolves stochastically and increases with market liquidity. Because the trader exploits her information gradually, the equilibrium price impact and market uncertainty are unaffected by her rate of acquisition. If she pays a fixed cost to acquire �lumpy� information at a time of her choosing, the market can break down: we show that no equilibria exist with endogenous information acquisition.

Capital gains taxation and funding for start-ups,"We examine how capital gains taxes affect investment in private start-up (i.e., pre-IPO) firms. Using data on capital raised in individual funding rounds, we estimate the effect of the 2010 SBJA, which implemented a full exemption from federal capital gains tax on the sale of qualified shares. Because of the resulting higher expected after-tax returns, we hypothesize and find evidence consistent with this capital gains tax reduction increasing the amount of investment in start-up firms per funding round by about 12%. The effect is stronger in start-up firms that are likely to have greater administrative capacity. We estimate that about one-third of the tax benefit is captured by investors.","['Alexander Edwards', 'Maximilian Todtenhaupt']","['Capital gains taxes','Start-ups','Tax capitalization']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301768,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,2,Alexander Edwards,2020,169.97114190294786
When low beats high: Riding the sales seasonality premium,"This paper examines whether predictable seasonal patterns in firm fundamentals generate time variation in stock returns.

Specifically, a long-short strategy of buying low-sales season stocks and shorting high-sales season stocks produces an annual alpha of 8.4% (14.5% over the last decade). This seasonal effect has a relatively high Sharpe ratio and occurs independently of previously documented seasonal anomalies.

We undertake the first comprehensive empirical analysis of bank CoCo issues, a market segment that comprises over 730 instruments totaling $521 billion. Four main findings emerge: (1) the propensity to issue a CoCo is higher for larger and better capitalized banks; (2) CoCo issues result in a statistically significant decline in issuers� CDS spread, indicating that they generate risk-reduction benefits and lower costs of debt (this is especially true for CoCos that convert into equity, have mechanical triggers, and are classified as Additional Tier 1 instruments); (3) CoCos with only discretionary triggers do not have a significant impact on CDS spreads; and (4) CoCo issues have no statistically significant impact on stock prices, except for principal write-down CoCos with a high trigger level, which have a positive effect.",[],"['Contingent convertible capital securities','Bail-in','Bank fragility']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301756,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,3,,2020,169.97114190294786

We also confirm other model-predicted tradeoffs. Larger funds are cheaper. Larger and cheaper funds are less active, based on our new measure of activeness. Better-diversified funds hold less-liquid stocks; they are also larger and cheaper, and they trade more.

Asset pricing: A tale of night and day,"The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) performs poorly overall, as market risk (beta) is weakly related to 24-h returns. This is because stock prices behave very differently with respect to their sensitivity to beta when markets are open for trading versus when they are closed. Stock returns are positively related to beta overnight, whereas returns are negatively related to beta during the trading day. These day-night relations hold for beta-sorted portfolios and individual stocks in the US and internationally as well as for industry and book-to-market portfolios and cash flow and discount rate beta-sorted portfolios. In addition to the change in slope of returns with respect to beta, the implied risk-free rate differs significantly between night and day. Consistent with this, returns on US Treasury futures differ significantly between night and day.",[],"['Asset pricing','CAPM','Risk-free rate','Day-night']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301732,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,3,,2020,169.97114190294786
Financial intermediation and capital reallocation,"To understand the link between financial intermediation activities and the real economy, we build a general equilibrium model in which agency frictions in the financial sector affect the efficiency of capital reallocation across firms and generate aggregate economic fluctuations. We develop a recursive policy iteration approach to fully characterize the nonlinear equilibrium dynamics and the off-steady-state crisis behavior. In our model, adverse shocks to agency frictions exacerbate capital misallocation and manifest themselves as variations in total factor productivity at the aggregate level.

Bank net worth and frustrated monetary policy,"I present a model in which bank net worth determines both loan market competition and monetary transmission to firm borrowing rates. In the model, banks are local monopolists for borrowers near them. When they are flush with equity, banks expand their lending, compete for customers at the edges of their markets, and pass through changes in the monetary policy rate to their loan rates. When they lose substantial equity, banks consolidate, retreat from rivalry, and frustrate monetary transmission. The model explains why interest rate pass-through weakens after financial crises. Its predictions are consistent with several facts about bank-to-firm lending.",[],"['Banking','Monetary policy','Monopolistic competition']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301744,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,3,,2020,169.97114190294786
The price effects of liquidity shocks: A study of the SEC�s tick size experiment,"Do stock prices of publicly listed companies respond to changes in transaction costs? Using the SEC�s pilot program that increased the tick size for approximately 1,200 randomly chosen stocks, we find a stock price decrease between 1.75% and 3.2% for small spread stocks affected by the larger tick size relative to a control group. We find that the increase in the present value of transaction costs accounts for a small percentage of the price decrease. We study channels of price variation due to changes in expected returns: information risk, investor horizon, and liquidity risk.

Collateral constraints and asset prices,"We study the effects of collateral constraints in an economy populated by investors with nonpledgeable labor incomes and heterogeneous preferences and beliefs. We show that these constraints inflate stock prices and generate spikes and crashes in price-dividend ratios and volatilities, clustering of volatilities, and leverage cycles. They also lead to substantial decreases in interest rates and increases in Sharpe ratios when investors are anxious about hitting constraints due to production crises in the economy.

The effect of minority veto rights on controller pay tunneling,"A central challenge in the regulation of controlled firms is curbing rent extraction by controllers. As independent directors and fiduciary duties are often insufficient, some jurisdictions give minority shareholders veto rights over related-party transactions. To assess these rights� effectiveness, we exploit a 2011 Israeli reform that gave minority shareholders veto rights over related-party transactions, including the pay of controllers and their relatives (�controller executives�). We find that the reform curbed controller-executive pay and led some controller executives to resign or go with little or no pay in circumstances suggesting their pay would be rejected.

Time-varying demand for lottery: Speculation ahead of earnings announcements,"Investor preferences for holding speculative assets are likely to be more pronounced ahead of firms� earnings announcements, probably because of lower inventory costs and immediate payoffs or because of enhanced investor attention. We show that the demand for lottery-like stocks is stronger ahead of earnings announcements, leading to a price run-up for these stocks. In sharp contrast to the standard underperformance of lottery-like stocks, lottery-like stocks outperform non-lottery stocks by about 52 basis points in the 5-day window ahead of earnings announcements. However, this return spread is reversed by 80 basis points in the 5-day window after the announcements. Moreover, this inverted-V-shaped pattern on cumulative return spreads is more pronounced among firms with a greater retail order imbalance, among firms with low institutional ownership, and in regions with a stronger gambling propensity, and it is also robust after controlling for past 12-month returns and various proxies for investor attention.",[],"['Speculation','Lottery','Earnings announcements','Skewness']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301835,Journal of Financial Economics,1.2433516094596744,138,3,,2020,169.97114190294786
Persuasion in relationship finance,"After initial investments, relationship financiers routinely observe interim information about projects before continuing financing them. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs produce information endogenously and issue securities to incumbent insider and competitive outsider investors. In such persuasion games with differentially informed receivers and contingent transfers, entrepreneurs� endogenous experimentation reduces insiders� information monopoly but impedes relationship formation through an �information production hold-up.� Insiders� information production and interim competition mitigate this hold-up and jointly explain empirical links between competition and relationship lending.

Policy uncertainty and corporate credit spreads,"We find a significant positive relation between changes in policy uncertainty and changes in credit spreads. Macroeconomic conditions, including general uncertainty, do not explain this result, which also holds when we use instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues. The impact of policy uncertainty is greater for firms that operate in regulation-intensive industries, face high tax rates, or are dependent on government spending. It is also stronger for firms that engage in political activities or rely on external financing.

Do people feel less at risk? Evidence from disaster experience,"Past studies typically have focused on whether people perceive more rare risk after experiencing catastrophic disasters. We show that people can also feel less risk with unexpected lucky disaster experience. By exploring a novel identification strategy based on households� expectations, we find that households perceive less (more) risk when they experience disasters that have lower (higher) fatalities than what was expected. This opposite experience effect of rare disasters is substantial. A one standard deviation increase in the negative (positive) experience shock is associated with a 1.71% decrease (a 1.31% increase) in the life insurance-to-portfolio ratio.

Are lemons sold first? Dynamic signaling in the mortgage market,"A central result in the theory of adverse selection in asset markets is that informed sellers can signal quality and obtain higher prices by delaying trade. This paper provides some of the first evidence of a signaling mechanism through trade delays using the residential mortgage market as a laboratory. We find a strong relationship between mortgage performance and time to sale for privately securitized mortgages. Additionally, deals made up of more seasoned mortgages are sold at lower yields. These effects are strongest in the “Alt-A” segment of the market, where mortgages are often sold with incomplete hard information, and in cases where the originator and the issuer of mortgage-backed securities are not affiliated.","['Manuel Adelino', 'Kristopher Gerardi', 'Barney Hartman-Glaser']","['Mortgage markets', 'Asymmetric information', 'Signaling']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302575,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,1,Manuel Adelino,2019,169.88699777329293
Should Long-Term Investors Time Volatility?,"A long-term investor who ignores variation in volatility gives up the equivalent of 2.4% of wealth per year.

We propose and test a new channel, the volatility composition channel, for how investment horizon interacts with volatility timing. Investors respond substantially less to volatility variation if the amount of mean reversion in returns disproportionally increases with volatility and also if mean reversion happens quickly.

The leverage effect and the basket-index put spread,"Benchmark models that exogenously specify equity dynamics cannot explain the large spread in prices between put options written on individual banks and options written on the bank index during the financial crisis. However, theory requires that asset dynamics be specified exogenously and that endogenously determined equity dynamics exhibit a “leverage effect” that increases put prices by fattening the left tail of the distribution. The leverage effect is larger for puts on individual stocks than for puts on the index, thus increasing the basket-index spread.

Policy externalities and banking integration,"Can policies directed at the banking sector in one jurisdiction spill over and affect real economic activity elsewhere? To investigate this question, I exploit changes in tax rates on bank profits across US states. Banks respond by reallocating small business lending to otherwise unaffected states. Moreover, counties in non-tax-changing states that have more exposure to treated banks experience greater changes in lending, which in turn impacts local employment. The findings demonstrate that policies aimed at the banking sector in one jurisdiction can impose externalities on other regions.

The use of credit default swaps by bond mutual funds: Liquidity provision and counterparty risk,"Corporate bond mutual funds increased their selling of credit protection in the credit default swaps (CDS) market during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. This trading activity was primarily in multi-name CDS, greater among larger and established funds, and directed toward counterparty dealers in financial distress. Funds that sold credit protection during the crisis experienced greater credit market risk and superior post-crisis performance, consistent with higher expected returns from liquidity provision. Funds using Lehman Brothers as a counterparty experienced abnormal outflows and returns of –2% immediately following Lehman's bankruptcy, suggesting that funds’ opportunistic trading in CDS exposed investors to counterparty risk.","['George O.

Using novel data on employees’ rights in bankruptcy, we estimate their impact on leverage, exploiting time-series, cross-country, and firm-level variation in the data. For financially unconstrained firms, results accord with the strategic debt model: leverage increases more in response to rises in corporate property values or profitability if employees have strong seniority in liquidation and weak rights in restructuring. Instead, in financially constrained firms leverage responds less to these shocks if employees have stronger seniority.","['Andrew Ellul', 'Marco Pagano']","['Workers’ rights', 'Bankruptcy', 'Seniority', 'Leverage', 'Wage bargaining']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301163,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,3,Andrew Ellul,2019,169.88699777329293
Shareholder bargaining power and the emergence of empty creditors,"Credit default swaps (CDSs) can create empty creditors who potentially force borrowers into inefficient bankruptcy but also reduce shareholders’ incentives to default strategically. We show theoretically and empirically that the presence and the effects of empty creditors on firm outcomes depend on the distribution of bargaining power among claimholders. If creditors would face powerful shareholders in debt renegotiation, firms are more likely to face the empty creditor problem. The empirical evidence confirms that more CDS insurance is written on firms with strong shareholders and that CDSs increase the bankruptcy risk of these same firms.

How do valuations impact outcomes of asset sales with heterogeneous bidders?,"Differences among bidder type-specific outcomes of asset sales are theoretically related to differences in bidders’ valuations and participation. The lead application to quantify these relations is takeover auctions: bidders are classified into strategic and financial, and bids are available. I structurally estimate valuations from all bids. The positive difference in premiums between strategic and financial acquirers is driven by the difference in dispersions of valuations (e.g., strategic bidders’ synergies are more dispersed) and the set of auction participants. The difference in average valuations is relatively unimportant. My approach can help explain outcomes of asset sales, even in settings with limited bidder data.",['Alexander S.

Furthermore, rises in the cost of capital for innovation-intensive firms predict declines in subsequent productivity and economic growth. We propose a production-based asset pricing model with endogenous innovation and fiscal policy shocks that can rationalize key aspects of the empirical evidence.

We provide empirical evidence of this distortion using matched employer-employee data from the Swedish population between 2000 and 2010.

Bankruptcy spillovers,"How do different bankruptcy approaches affect the local economy? Using US Census microdata, we explore the spillover effects of reorganization and liquidation on geographically proximate firms. We exploit the random assignment of bankruptcy judges as a source of exogenous variation in the probability of liquidation. We find that employment declines substantially in the immediate neighborhood of the liquidated establishments, relative to reorganized establishments. The spillover effects are highly localized and concentrate in nontradable and service sectors, consistent with a reduction in local consumer traffic and a decline in knowledge spillovers between firms. The evidence highlights the externalities that bankruptcy design can impose on nonbankrupt firms.","['Shai Bernstein', 'Emanuele Colonnelli', 'Xavier Giroud', 'Benjamin Iverson']","['Bankruptcy', 'Agglomeration', 'Local economy']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302733,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,3,Shai Bernstein,2019,169.88699777329293
Collateralizing liquidity,"I develop a dynamic model of optimal funding to understand why financial assets are used as collateral instead of being sold to raise funds. Firms need funds to invest in risky projects with nonobservable returns. Since holding these assets allows firms to raise these funds, investing firms value the asset more than noninvesting ones. When assets are less than perfectly liquid and investment opportunities are persistent, collateralized debt minimizes asset transfers from investing to noninvesting firms and thus is optimal. Frictions in asset markets lead to an illiquidity discount and a collateral premium, which increase with the asset’s illiquidity.",['Cecilia Parlatore'],"['Collateral', 'Liquidity', 'Optimal contracts', 'Private information']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302253,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,2,Cecilia Parlatore,2019,169.88699777329293
New goods and asset prices,"I extend the consumption capital asset pricing model to incorporate expanding product variety over time and states of nature. In the model, consumers have a love of variety, and consumption consists of different components: product groups and brands. By raising future marginal utility, growth in product groups increases the incentive to save and reduces the risk-free rate. By making marginal utility more volatile, variation in brand and quality growth magnifies consumption risk and raises the equity premium. Embedding new goods in a long-run risk setting has similar implications.",['Paul Scanlon'],"['Equity premium', 'Innovation', 'New product introduction', 'Risk-free rate']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303143,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,3,Paul Scanlon,2019,169.88699777329293

Acquirer reference prices and acquisition performance,"In a comprehensive sample of mergers and acquisitions, we find a reference price effect: acquirers earn higher (lower) announcement-period returns when their pre-announcement stock prices are well below (near) their 52-week highs. This reference price effect is stronger in acquisitions of private targets, deals involving greater uncertainty, and acquirers with greater individual investor ownership, and it is reversed in the subsequent year. Further, acquirer reference prices affect bid premia and target announcement-period returns in deals with greater uncertainty in acquirer valuation. The overall evidence is consistent with investors irrationally using 52-week high prices as a measure of acquirer valuation.","['Qingzhong Ma', 'David A.

Our model highlights the relevance of drawing down credit lines to fund investment options in an effective way and quantitatively matches well the levels and dynamics of cash, credit lines, and leverage.

What a difference a (birth) month makes: The relative age effect and fund manager performance,"Many US states have a single cutoff date for school entry, meaning that some children are older than others when they begin kindergarten. We show that this variation in birth months is associated with differences in adult labor market outcomes in the mutual fund industry. Relatively older managers (i.e., those born just after the cutoff) make better stock selections, and their funds outperform their younger peers’ funds by 0.48% per annum. This difference is linked to increased confidence. Survey respondents judge relatively older managers as appearing more confident in photographs, and these managers display more confident behavior: making larger bets, window dressing their holdings less, and securing more fund flows conditional on performance.","['John (Jianqiu) Bai', 'Linlin Ma', 'Kevin A.

Selection versus talent effects on firm value,"Measuring the value of labor-market hires for stock prices, be it underwriters when firms go public (IPOs) or chief executive officers (CEOs), is difficult due to selection. Opaque firms with higher costs of capital benefit more from prestigious underwriters, while productive firms benefit more from talented CEOs. Using assignment models, we show that the importance of talent (or agent heterogeneity) relative to selection (or firm heterogeneity) is measured by wage increases across agents of different compensation ranks divided by changes in output across their firms. The median of this ratio is 0.5% for underwriters and 2% for CEOs.","['Briana Chang', 'Harrison Hong']","['CEO', 'Underwriters', 'IPO Underpricing', 'Prestige', 'Talent', 'Selection', 'Sorting']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300017,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,3,Briana Chang,2019,169.88699777329293

We reconcile these findings by providing a dynamic analysis of option prices with costly short-selling and option market makers. We obtain simple, closed-form, unique option bid and ask prices that represent option market makers’ expected hedging costs, and are weighted averages of well-known benchmark prices (Black–Scholes, Heston). Our analysis delivers rich implications that support the empirical evidence on the effects of short-selling costs and bans on option prices, as well as uncovering several novel predictions.

Cross-sectional alpha dispersion and performance evaluation,"Our paper explores the link between cross-sectional fund return dispersion and performance evaluation. The foundation of our model is the simple intuition that in periods of high return dispersion, which is associated with high levels of idiosyncratic risk for zero-alpha funds, unskilled managers can more easily disguise themselves as skilled. Rational investors should be more skeptical and apply larger discounts to reported performance in high dispersion environments. Our empirical results are consistent with this prediction. Using fund flow data, we show that a one standard deviation increase in cross-sectional return dispersion is associated with an 11% to 17% decline in flow-performance sensitivity. The effect is stronger for recent data and among outperforming funds.","['Campbell R.

Municipal borrowing costs and state policies for distressed municipalities,"Policies on financially distressed municipalities differ across US states, with some allowing unconditional access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy (Chapter 9 states) and others having proactive policies to assist distressed municipalities (Proactive states). These differences significantly affect borrowing costs. In Chapter 9 states, local municipal bond yields are higher, more cyclical, and more sensitive to default events than Proactive states. Default events have a contagion effect in Chapter 9 states, but not Proactive states. Lower local borrowing costs in Proactive states come at the expense of the state via higher intergovernmental revenue transfers in times of weak economic conditions.","['Pengjie Gao', 'Chang Lee', 'Dermot Murphy']","['Default risk', 'Government policy', 'Municipal bonds', 'Creditor protections']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1830299X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,2,Pengjie Gao,2019,169.88699777329293
Do private equity funds manipulate reported returns?,"Private equity funds hold assets that are hard to value. Managers have incentives to distort reported valuations if these reports are used by investors to decide on commitments to subsequent funds. Using a large dataset of buyout and venture funds, we test for the presence of return manipulations. We find that some underperforming managers inflate reported returns during fundraising. However, those managers are less likely to raise a next fund, suggesting that investors can see through the manipulation. In contrast, top-performing funds appear to understate valuations.

We study whether decision fatigue affects analysts’ judgments. Analysts cover multiple firms and often issue several forecasts in a single day. We find that forecast accuracy declines over the course of a day as the number of forecasts the analyst has already issued increases. Also consistent with decision fatigue, we find that the more forecasts an analyst issues, the higher the likelihood the analyst resorts to more heuristic decisions by herding more closely with the consensus forecast, self-herding (i.e., reissuing their own previous outstanding forecasts), and issuing a rounded forecast. Finally, we find that the stock market understands these effects and discounts for analyst decision fatigue.","['David Hirshleifer', 'Yaron Levi', 'Ben Lourie', 'Siew Hong Teoh']","['Analysts', 'Decision fatigue', 'Heuristic', 'Behavioral finance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300054,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,1,David Hirshleifer,2019,169.88699777329293

To address this issue, we develop a large-scale approach that expands the cross-section to several thousand portfolios. Our novel approach is simple, widely applicable, and allows for formal evaluation/comparison tests. Its benefits are confirmed in empirical tests of CAPM- and characteristic-based models. While these models are all misspecified, we uncover striking performance differences between them.

"Inverted fee structures, tick size, and market quality","Stock exchanges compete for order flow through their fee models. A traditional model pays rebates to liquidity suppliers, and an inverted model pays rebates to liquidity demanders. Using a regulatory intervention to examine the interaction between tick size, restrictions on dark trading, and exchange fees, we show that traders use inverted venues to adjust for suboptimal tick sizes. Increased inverted venue activity improves pricing efficiency and liquidity, especially when the tick size is binding. We show that the sub-tick price improvement offered by inverted venues enhances competition for liquidity provision and increases information impounded into prices through nonmarketable limit orders.","['Carole Comerton-Forde', 'Vincent Grégoire', 'Zhuo Zhong']","['Exchange fees', 'Inverted venues', 'Dark trading']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300595,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,1,Carole Comerton-Forde,2019,169.88699777329293
Preference for dividends and return comovement,"Stocks that initiate dividends tend to comove more with other dividend-paying stocks and comove less with non-dividend payers. This is also true for: (a) dividend initiations that are motivated by the exogenous 2003 dividend tax cut; and (b) the cash dividend share class of Citizens Utilities (relative to its stock dividend class). We find that flows to dividend prone (averse) mutual funds increase the comovement among dividend-paying (non-dividend paying) stocks. Overall, the evidence supports the proposition that the trading of pro-dividend (dividend-averse) clienteles induces an extra factor in dividend payers (non-payers), beyond those associated with changes in common factors.","['Allaudeen Hameed', 'Jing Xie']","['Dividend', 'Dividend clientele', 'Comovement', 'Style investing']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302769,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,1,Allaudeen Hameed,2019,169.88699777329293
The value of collateral in trade finance,"Suppliers are subject to the credit risk of their customers when they sell products on credit. However, rights to the collateral value of the products they sell may mitigate some of this risk. This paper demonstrates the important role of laws that support suppliers’ rights to reclaim and liquidate collateral. Using a change in the US bankruptcy code that altered the rights of a subset of suppliers, I use a difference-in-differences setting to show that an improvement in suppliers’ rights to the liquidation value of collateral results in an increase in the amount and duration of trade credit offered. The increase in collateral protection also reduced suppliers’ lending standards, resulting in more dispersed trade credit lending and riskier customer portfolios. Finally, I find that the increase in collateral rights decreased suppliers’ incentives to monitor their customers, consistent with collateral and monitoring being substitutes. Overall, the paper shows that with strong legal protections in place, trade credit has an important collateral component.",['Anna M.

We examine over 700 private equity partnerships and show that the allocation of fund economics to individual partners varies drastically, even among the most senior partners, and appears divorced from past success as an investor, being instead related to status as a founder. A smaller share of carried interest and ownership—and inequality in fund economics more generally—is associated with departures of senior partners which, in turn is negatively related to the funds’ ability to raise additional capital.","['Victoria Ivashina', 'Josh Lerner']","['Partnerships', 'Venture capital', 'Leveraged buyout']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302058,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,1,Victoria Ivashina,2019,169.88699777329293

Its predictive power is economically comparable and is informationally complementary to existing measures of investor sentiment.

Does skin-in-the-game affect security performance?,This paper documents that complex financial innovations like collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) enabled informed parties in the commercial mortgage-backed securitization pipeline to reduce their skin-in-the-game in a way not observable to other market participants. This reduction in first-loss security retention significantly impacted the probability that more senior tranches ultimately defaulted. We show that this performance is entirely driven by the amount of first-loss sold to (affiliated) CDOs within 12 months of the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) deal. Our result is robust to using the differential access of first-loss investors to CDO funding as an instrument to identify exogenous variations in the retention of first-loss securities.,"['Adam B Ashcraft', 'Kunal Gooriah', 'Amir Kermani']","['Collateralized debt obligations', 'Risk retention', 'Asymmetric information']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301096,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,2,Adam B Ashcraft,2019,169.88699777329293
Trade credit and supplier competition,"This paper examines how competition among suppliers affects their willingness to provide trade credit financing. Trade credit extended by a supplier to a cash constrained retailer allows the latter to increase cash purchases from its other suppliers, leading to a free rider problem. A supplier that represents a smaller share of the retailer’s purchases internalizes a smaller part of the benefit from increased spending by the retailer and, as a result, extends less trade credit relative to its sales. In consequence, retailers with dispersed suppliers obtain less trade credit than those whose suppliers are more concentrated. The free rider problem is especially detrimental to a trade creditor when the free-riding suppliers are its product market competitors, leading to a negative relation between product substitutability among suppliers to a given retailer and trade credit that the former provide to the latter. We test the model using both simulated and real data. The estimated relations are consistent with the model’s predictions and are statistically and economically significant.","['Jiri Chod', 'Evgeny Lyandres', 'S.

"Mark Twain’s Cat: Investment experience, categorical thinking, and stock selection","This paper examines the effect of prior investment experience in specific industries on subsequent investment decisions. Using households’ trading records from a large discount broker between 1991 and 1996, I find that prior success in a given industry increases the likelihood of subsequent purchases in the same industry. The effect is stronger for more recent experiences and for less sophisticated or diversified investors, and it is not wealth enhancing. The results suggest investors categorize industries at a highly resolved level, finer than the Fama–French ten-industry classification.

Volatility and the cross-section of corporate bond returns,"This paper examines the pricing of volatility risk and idiosyncratic volatility in the cross-section of corporate bond returns for the period of 1994–2016. Results show that bonds with high volatility betas have low expected returns, and this negative relation appears in all segments of corporate bonds. Further, bonds with high idiosyncratic bond (stock) volatility have high (low) expected returns, and this relation strengthens as ratings decrease. Conventional risk factors and bond/issuer characteristics cannot account for these cross-sectional relations. There is evidence that the effect of idiosyncratic stock volatility on expected bond returns works through the channel of contemporaneous stock returns.","['Kee H.

Do labor markets discipline? Evidence from RMBS bankers,"This paper examines whether employees involved in residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) securitization experienced internal and external labor market consequences relative to similar non-RMBS employees in the same banks and why. Senior RMBS bankers experienced similar levels of job retention, promotion, and external job opportunities. Even signers of RMBS deals with high loss and misreporting rates or deals implicated in lawsuits experienced no adverse internal or external labor market outcomes. These findings are likely not explained by targeted or delayed employee discipline, small legal fines, or protection due to pending litigation but are consistent with implicit upper-management approval of RMBS activities.","['John M.

Costs and benefits of financial conglomerate affiliation: Evidence from hedge funds,"This paper explores how affiliation to financial conglomerates affects asset managers’ access to capital, risk taking, and performance. Focusing on a sample of hedge funds, we find that financial conglomerate-affiliated hedge funds (FCAHFs) have lower flow-performance sensitivity than other hedge funds and that this difference is particularly pronounced during financial turmoil. Arguably, thanks to more stable funding, FCAHFs allow their investors to redeem capital more freely and are able to capture price rebounds. Because investors could value these characteristics, our findings provide a rationale for why financial conglomerate affiliation is widespread, although it slightly hampers performance on average.","['Francesco Franzoni', 'Mariassunta Giannetti']","['Hedge funds', 'Financial conglomerates', 'Risk taking']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301084,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,2,Francesco Franzoni,2019,169.88699777329293
An anatomy of the market return,"This paper introduces a model free decomposition of S&P 500 forward market index returns in terms of realized and implied dispersion, downside, and tail risk using option portfolios. The decomposition lends itself by construction to learn about the different sources of risk in the market return and subsequently to visual and formal diagnosing of asset pricing models. It utilizes a novel conditional frequency analysis on the basis of available options rather than the times series of the S&P 500. Empirically, downside risk accounts for most of the forward market return, while symmetric tail risk is not prominently featured. The predictable, persistent part of the realized return is small. Nevertheless, signals revealed by this risk anatomy provide predictive out of sample power for realized returns, in particular for longer maturities. Furthermore, it indicates that models with identically and independently distributed state variables are generally misspecified in this market, and that care must be taken when calibrating disaster risk models. A formal test based on the risk anatomy rejects a model with time-varying disaster intensity.",['Paul Schneider'],"['Equity premium', 'Conditional', 'Frequency analysis', 'Skewness', 'Downside risk']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303052,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,2,Paul Schneider,2019,169.88699777329293
Variance risk in aggregate stock returns and time-varying return predictability,"This paper introduces a new out-of-sample forecasting methodology for monthly market returns using the variance risk premium (VRP) that is both statistically and economically significant. This methodology is motivated by the ‘beta representation,’ which implies that the market risk premium is related to the price of variance risk by the variance risk exposure. Hence, when the slope of the contemporaneous regression of market returns on variance innovation is larger, future returns are more sharply related to the current VRP. Also, predictions are more accurate when market returns are highly correlated to variance shocks.",['Sungjune Pyun'],"['Variance risk premium', 'Leverage effect', 'Return predictability', 'Beta representation', 'Contemporaneous beta approach']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302782,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,1,Sungjune Pyun,2019,169.88699777329293
The impact of jumps on carry trade returns,"This paper investigates how jump risks are priced in currency markets. We find that currencies whose changes are more sensitive to negative market jumps provide significantly higher expected returns. The positive risk premium constitutes compensation for the extreme losses during periods of market turmoil. Using the empirical findings, we propose a jump modified carry trade strategy, which has approximately two-percentage-point (per annum) higher returns than the regular carry trade strategy. These findings result from the fact that negative jump betas are significantly related to the riskiness of currencies and business conditions.","['Suzanne S.

Too good to be true? Fallacies in evaluating risk factor models,"This paper is concerned with statistical inference and model evaluation in possibly misspecified and unidentified linear asset pricing models estimated by maximum likelihood. Strikingly, when spurious factors (that is, factors that are uncorrelated with the returns on the test assets) are present, the model exhibits perfect fit, as measured by the squared correlation between the model’s fitted expected returns and the average realized returns. Furthermore, factors that are spurious are selected with high probability, and factors that are useful are driven out of the model. While ignoring potential misspecification and lack of identification can be very problematic for models with macroeconomic factors, empirical specifications with traded factors (e.g., Fama and French, 1993; Hou et al., 2015) do not suffer from the identification problems shown in this study.","['Nikolay Gospodinov', 'Raymond Kan', 'Cesare Robotti']","['Asset pricing', 'Spurious risk factors', 'Unidentified models', 'Model misspecification', 'Maximum likelihood', 'Goodness of fit', 'Rank test']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303027,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,2,Nikolay Gospodinov,2019,169.88699777329293
Liquidity windfalls: The consequences of repo rehypothecation,"This paper presents a model of repo intermediation in which dealers intermediate secured financing between lenders and borrowers using the same collateral. Lenders are insulated from dealers through their repo’s collateral, but borrowers are exposed to dealers through the loss of their collateral. This makes lenders’ repo terms insensitive to dealers’ default, while borrowers’ repo terms are not. The model shows that when repos serve to intermediate collateral, haircuts are negative.

The relevance of broker networks for information diffusion in the stock market,"This paper shows that the network of relationships between brokers and institutional investors shapes information diffusion in the stock market. Central brokers gather information by executing informed trades, which is then leaked to their best clients. After large informed trades, other institutional investors are significantly more likely to execute similar trades through the same broker, allowing them to capture returns that are twice as large as their normal trading performance. Also indicative of information leakage, the clients of the broker employed by activist investors to execute their trades buy the same stocks just before the filing of the 13D.","['Marco Di Maggio', 'Francesco Franzoni', 'Amir Kermani', 'Carlo Sommavilla']","['Broker networks', 'Institutional investors', 'Asset prices', 'Information leakage']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930087X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,2,Marco Di Maggio,2019,169.88699777329293
"Time-varying ambiguity, credit spreads, and the levered equity premium","This paper studies the effects of time-varying Knightian uncertainty (ambiguity) on asset pricing in a Lucas exchange economy. Specifically, it considers a general equilibrium model where an ambiguity-averse agent applies a discount rate that is adjusted not only for the current magnitude of ambiguity but also for the risk associated with its future fluctuations. As such, both the ambiguity level and volatility help to raise the asset premiums and accommodate richer dynamics of asset prices. Based on a novel empirical measure of the ambiguity level, the estimated model can capture the empirical levels of corporate credit spreads and the equity premium while endogenously matching the historical default probability. More importantly, the model-implied credit spread and equity price-dividend ratio perform remarkably in tracking the time variations in their historical counterparts.",['Zhan Shi'],"['Ambiguity', 'Credit spreads', 'Equity premium']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301138,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,3,Zhan Shi,2019,169.88699777329293
Corporate control activism,"This paper studies the role of activist investors in the market for corporate control. Our theory proposes that activist investors have an inherent advantage relative to bidders in pressuring entrenched incumbents to sell. As counterparties to the acquisition, bidders have a fundamental conflict of interests with target shareholders from which activist investors are immune. Therefore, unlike activists, the ability of bidders to win proxy fights is very limited. This result is consistent with the large number of activist campaigns that have resulted with the target’s sale to a third party and the evidence that most proxy fights are launched by activists, not by bidders.","['Adrian Aycan Corum', 'Doron Levit']","['Acquisition', 'Corporate governance', 'Proxy fight', 'Shareholder activism', 'Takeover']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300236,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,1,Adrian Aycan Corum,2019,169.88699777329293

The effect of bank monitoring on public bond terms,"This study examines the effect of bank loan monitoring on public bond contract design. We find that bond yield spreads are lower and that bond issuance amounts are larger when a borrower has recently obtained a private loan, consistent with bond issuers benefiting from the screening and ongoing monitoring of banks. We find that these bonds include more covenants than bonds issued without the cross-monitoring of banks, consistent with bondholders wanting to protect themselves from private lenders. This effect is larger for firms with high information asymmetry and larger potential conflicts between different lender types. Our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests. Overall, our empirical results suggest that borrowers that precede their public bond issuances with private loan agreements receive more favorable bond terms. Meanwhile, these benefits are associated with the cost of increased monitoring by public bonds.","['Zhiming Ma', 'Derrald Stice', 'Christopher Williams']","['Debt contracting', 'Public bonds', 'Private loans', 'Bank monitoring']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930025X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,2,Zhiming Ma,2019,169.88699777329293
"Mood, firm behavior, and aggregate economic outcomes","This study examines whether mood affects the aggregate state-level macroeconomy through its impact on firm-level decisions. Using sky cloud cover as a proxy for mood, we show that mood affects the economic expectations of small business managers. After relatively sunnier periods, managers have more optimistic expectations, and the component of their expectations related to mood influences hiring and investment decisions. Consequently, mood affects state-level job creation and new business starts, especially during periods of greater economic uncertainty. These results suggest that mood-induced economic expectations influence firm-level managerial decisions and state-level macroeconomic fluctuations.","['Vidhi Chhaochharia', 'Dasol Kim', 'George M.

This event prevented its client firms from receiving a combination of lending and underwriting services. After the dissolution, these firms experienced a sharper decline in market value, more frequent switching of seasoned equity offering (SEO) underwriters, and the disappearance of lower SEO discounts when they had close lending relationships with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the ex-parent commercial bank.

In search of preference shock risks: Evidence from longevity risks and momentum profits,"Time-preference shocks affect agents’ preferences for assets with different durations. We consider longevity risk as a source of time-preference shocks and model it in the recursive preferences setting. This implies a consumption-based three-factor model, including longevity risk, consumption growth rate, and the market portfolio, where longevity has a negative price of risk. Empirically, this model explains many well-known cross-sectional portfolios. Notably, we find that longevity risk and the momentum factor share a common business cycle component, i.e., short-run consumption risks. Prior winners (losers) provide hedging against mortality (longevity) risk and thus have higher (lower) expected returns, because winners have higher dividend growth and shorter equity durations than losers. Time-varying longevity risk captures most momentum profits over time, including the large momentum crashes observed in the data.","['Zhanhui Chen', 'Bowen Yang']","['Time-preference shocks', 'Longevity risk', 'Momentum profits', 'Equity durations', 'Consumption-based models']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300042,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,1,Zhanhui Chen,2019,169.88699777329293
Empirical tests of asset pricing models with individual assets: Resolving the errors-in-variables bias in risk premium estimation,"To attenuate an inherent errors-in-variables bias, portfolios are widely employed to test asset pricing models; but portfolios might mask relevant risk- or return-related features of individual stocks. We propose an instrumental variables approach that allows the use of individual stocks as test assets, yet delivers consistent estimates of ex post risk premiums. This estimator also yields well-specified tests in small samples. The market risk premium under the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the liquidity-adjusted CAPM, premiums on risk factors under the Fama–French three- and five-factor models, and the Hou et al.

Minimum payments and debt paydown in consumer credit cards,"Using a data set covering one quarter of the U.S. general-purpose credit card market, we document that 29% of accounts regularly make payments at or near the minimum payment. To explain the prevalence of low payment amounts, we exploit changes in issuers’ minimum payment formulas to quantify the explanatory power of two potential theories: liquidity constraints and anchoring. At least 22% of near-minimum payers (and 9% of all accounts) respond to the formula changes in a manner consistent with anchoring as opposed to liquidity constraints alone.

Do firms hedge with foreign currency derivatives for employees?,"Using a sample of 3004 US firm-years with foreign sales, we provide the first evidence that a firm's employee treatment score is an important determinant of its fraction of foreign sales hedged with currency-based derivatives. The positive relation between employee treatment rating and currency hedging activity is driven by firms operating in competitive industries, businesses with relatively unique products or assets, and companies adopting aggressive business strategies. These results suggest that firms with foreign sales tend to factor employee benefits in their currency hedging policies when their acquisition, development, and retention of human capital are especially costly or highly valued.","['Pinghsun Huang', 'Hsin-Yi Huang', 'Yan Zhang']","['Currency hedging', 'Employee treatment', 'Human capital']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300212,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,2,Pinghsun Huang,2019,169.88699777329293

Do firms issue more equity when markets become more liquid?,"Using quarterly data on initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) for 37 countries from 1995 to 2014, we show that changes in equity issuance are positively related to lagged changes in aggregate local stock market liquidity. This relation is as economically significant as the well-known relation between equity issuance and lagged stock returns. It survives the inclusion of proxies for market timing, capital market conditions, growth prospects, asymmetric information, and investor sentiment.

High frequency trading and comovement in financial markets,"Using the staggered entry of Chi-X in 12 European equity markets as a source of exogenous variation in high frequency trading (HFT), we find that HFT causes significant increases in comovement in returns and in liquidity. About one-third of the increase in return comovement is due to faster diffusion of market-wide information. We attribute the remaining two-thirds to correlated trading strategies of HFTs. The increase in liquidity comovement is consistent with HFT liquidity providers being better able to monitor other stocks and adjust their liquidity provision accordingly.

Internalizing governance externalities: The role of institutional cross-ownership,"We analyze the role of institutional cross-ownership in internalizing corporate governance externalities using granular mutual fund proxy voting data. Exploiting within-proposal and within-institution variation, we show that an institution's holdings in peer firms are positively associated with the likelihood that the institution votes against management on shareholder-sponsored governance proposals. We further find that high aggregate cross-ownership positively predicts management losing a vote. Overall, our results provide evidence that cross-ownership incentivizes institutional investors to play a more active monitoring role, suggesting that institutional cross-ownership serves as a market-based mechanism to alleviate the inefficiency induced by governance externalities.","['Jie\xa0(Jack) He', 'Jiekun Huang', 'Shan Zhao']","['Corporate governance', 'Externalities', 'Cross-ownership', 'Proxy voting', 'Institutional investors']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300844,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,2,Jie\xa0(Jack) He,2019,169.88699777329293
"Liquidity, innovation, and endogenous growth","We build a model of endogenous, innovation-driven growth in which innovative firms have costly access to outside financing and hoard cash reserves to maintain financial flexibility. We show that financing frictions slow down Schumpeterian creative destruction by discouraging entry. As a result, financing frictions importantly affect the composition of growth, by reducing the contribution of entrants but spurring the contribution of incumbents. We investigate the net impact of these countervailing effects on the equilibrium growth rate and welfare.","['Semyon Malamud', 'Francesca Zucchi']","['Innovation', 'Cash management', 'Financing frictions', 'Endogenous growth']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303106,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,2,Semyon Malamud,2019,169.88699777329293
Generalized recovery,"We characterize when physical probabilities, marginal utilities, and the discount rate can be recovered from observed state prices for several future time periods. We make no assumptions of the probability distribution, thus generalizing the time-homogeneous stationary model of Ross (2015). Recovery is feasible when the number of maturities with observable prices is higher than the number of states of the economy (or the number of parameters characterizing the pricing kernel). When recovery is feasible, our model allows a closed-form linearized solution. We implement our model empirically, testing the predictive power of the recovered expected return and other recovered statistics.","['Christian Skov Jensen', 'David Lando', 'Lasse Heje Pedersen']","['Recovery', 'Asset pricing', 'Pricing kernel', 'Predicting returns']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303350,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,1,Christian Skov Jensen,2019,169.88699777329293
Liquidity standards and the value of an informed lender of last resort,"We consider a dynamic model in which receiving support from the lender of last resort (LLR) may help banks to weather investor runs. We show the need for regulatory liquidity standards when the underlying social trade-offs make the uninformed LLR inclined to support troubled banks during a run. Liquidity standards increase the time available before the LLR must decide on supporting the bank. This facilitates the arrival of information on the bank’s financial condition and improves the efficiency of the decision taken by the LLR, a role that can be modified but not replaced with the use of capital regulation.","['João A.C.

Size and value in China,"We construct size and value factors in China. The size factor excludes the smallest 30% of firms, which are companies valued significantly as potential shells in reverse mergers that circumvent tight IPO constraints. The value factor is based on the earnings-price ratio, which subsumes the book-to-market ratio in capturing all Chinese value effects. Our three-factor model strongly dominates a model formed by just replicating the Fama and French (1993) procedure in China. Unlike that model, which leaves a 17% annual alpha on the earnings-price factor, our model explains most reported Chinese anomalies, including profitability and volatility anomalies.","['Jianan Liu', 'Robert F.

Counterparty credit risk and derivatives pricing,We derive a model with qualitative implications for options pricing under counterparty credit risk and provide empirical evidence using the data from the Hong Kong derivatives market during 2005–2014. We find that the log-price difference between a derivative warrant with counterparty credit risk and an otherwise identical option without counterparty credit risk is significantly and negatively associated with the credit default swap spread on the warrant issuer. We also find that the prices of out-of-the-money put warrants are more sensitive to credit risk than those of other warrants.

How news and its context drive risk and returns around the world,"We develop a classification methodology for the context and content of news articles to predict risk and return in stock markets in 51 developed and emerging economies. A parsimonious summary of news, including topic-specific sentiment, frequency, and unusualness (entropy) of word flow, predicts future country-level returns, volatilities, and drawdowns. Economic and statistical significance are high and larger for year ahead than monthly predictions. The effect of news measures on market outcomes differs by country type and over time. News stories about emerging markets contain more incremental information. Out-of-sample testing confirms the economic value of our approach for forecasting country-level market outcomes.","['Charles W.

An asset pricing approach to testing general term structure models,"We develop a new empirical approach to term structure analysis that allows testing for time-varying risk premiums and arbitrage opportunities in models with both unobservable factors and factors identified as the innovations to observed macroeconomic variables. Factors can play double roles as both covariance-generating common shocks driving yields and determinants of market prices of risk in cross-sectional pricing. The evidence favors time-varying risk prices significantly related to the second Stock–Watson principal component of macroeconomic variables and to changes in the industrial production index. Our preferred specification includes these two observable and two unobservable factors, with the no-arbitrage condition imposed.","['Bent Jesper Christensen', 'Michel van der Wel']","['Bond aging effect', 'Macroeconomic conditioning variables', 'Nonlinear drift restriction', 'Time-varying risk premiums', 'Yield curve model']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300649,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,1,Bent Jesper Christensen,2019,169.88699777329293
Government debt and corporate leverage: International evidence,"We empirically investigate the impact of government debt on corporate financing decisions in an international setting. We show a negative relation between government debt and corporate leverage using data on 40 countries between 1990–2014. This negative relation is stronger for government debt that is financed domestically, for firms that are larger and more profitable, and in countries with more developed equity markets. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we use an instrumental variable approach based on military spending and a quasi-natural experiment based on the introduction of the Euro currency. Our findings suggest that government debt crowds out corporate debt.","['Irem Demirci', 'Jennifer Huang', 'Clemens Sialm']","['Government debt', 'Capital structure', 'Crowding out']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300637,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,2,Irem Demirci,2019,169.88699777329293
The information sensitivity of debt in good and bad times,"We empirically show the dynamics of information production and information sensitivity of bank debt around the Great Recession. As more precise information is produced at the onset of the crisis, bank debt becomes informationally sensitive, along two separate dimensions. First, precise information amplifies the effect of market expectations on default risk; second, for banks that are already expected to perform poorly, more precise information further increases default risk. Both effects are muted in good times. Overall, our findings are consistent with information-based models of financial crises.","['Emanuele Brancati', 'Marco Macchiavelli']","['Financial crisis', 'CDS spreads', 'Information sensitivity']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300029,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,1,Emanuele Brancati,2019,169.88699777329293
Inferring volatility dynamics and risk premia from the S&P 500 and VIX markets,"We estimate a flexible affine model using an unbalanced panel containing S&P 500 and VIX index returns and option prices and analyze the contribution of VIX options to the model’s in- and out-of-sample performance. We find that they contain valuable information on the risk-neutral conditional distributions of volatility at different time horizons, which is not spanned by the S&P 500 market. This information allows enhanced estimation of the variance risk premium. We gain new insights on the term structure of the variance risk premium, present a trading strategy exploiting these insights, and show how to improve S&P 500 return forecasts.","['Chris Bardgett', 'Elise Gourier', 'Markus Leippold']","['S&P 500 and VIX joint modeling', 'Volatility dynamics', 'Particle filter', 'Variance risk premium']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302605,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,3,Chris Bardgett,2019,169.88699777329293
"Probability of price crashes, rational speculative bubbles, and the cross-section of stock returns","We estimate an ex ante probability of extreme negative returns (crashes) of individual stocks as a measure of potential overpricing and find that stocks with a high probability of crashes earn abnormally low returns. Stocks with high crash probability are overpriced regardless of the level of institutional ownership or variations in investor sentiment, and moreover, they exhibit increasing institutional demand until their prices reach the peak of overvaluation. We also find that institutional investors who overweight high crash probability stocks outperform the others, indicating that they have skill in timing bubbles and crashes of individual stocks. Our findings imply that sophisticated investors may not always trade against mispricing but time the correction of overpricing, and suggest that the crash effect we find could arise at least partially from rational speculative bubbles, not entirely from sentiment-driven overpricing.","['Jeewon Jang', 'Jangkoo Kang']","['Price crashes', 'Overpricing', 'Anomalies', 'Institutional investors', 'Rational speculative bubbles']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302812,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,1,Jeewon Jang,2019,169.88699777329293
Entry and competition in takeover auctions,"We estimate the degree of uncertainty faced by potential bidders in takeover auctions and quantify how it affects prices in auctions and negotiations. The high degree of uncertainty revealed by our structural estimation encourages entry in auctions but reduces a target’s bargaining power in negotiations. In the aggregate, auctions and negotiations produce similar prices, even though auctions are preferred in takeover markets with high uncertainty, while the reverse is true for negotiations. Firm characteristics predict pre-entry uncertainty and thus are informative about the relative performance of auctions and negotiations for individual targets.","['Matthew Gentry', 'Caleb Stroup']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Auctions', 'Structural estimation', 'Negotiations', 'Takeovers', 'Information frictions']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302964,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,2,Matthew Gentry,2019,169.88699777329293
Bubbles for Fama,"We evaluate Eugene F. Fama's claim that stock prices do not exhibit price bubbles. Based on US industry returns (1926‒2014) and international sector returns (1985‒2014), we present four findings (1) Fama is correct in that a sharp price increase of an industry portfolio does not, on average, predict unusually low returns going forward; (2) such sharp price increases predict a substantially heightened probability of a crash but not of a further price boom; (3) attributes of the price run-up, including volatility, turnover, issuance, and the price path of the run-up, help forecast an eventual crash; and (4) these attributes also help forecast future returns.

The value of access to finance: Evidence from M&As,"We examine synergies in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) generated by firms’ comparative advantages in access to bank finance. We find robust evidence that greater access to bank finance increases firms’ attractiveness as acquisition targets. Targets’ comparative advantage in bank finance improves bank credit supply and reduces financing costs for the merged firms. These effects are more pronounced for acquirers with greater frictions in accessing bank loans and acquirers with greater growth opportunities. Overall, this paper reveals that targets, not just acquirers, contribute to financial synergies in M&As.","['Jess Cornaggia', 'Jay Yin Li']","['M&A', 'Access to finance', 'Financial synergy']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302551,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,1,Jess Cornaggia,2019,169.88699777329293
Institutional herding and its price impact: Evidence from the corporate bond market,"We examine the extent to which institutional investors herd in the U.S. corporate bond market and the price impact of their herding behavior. We find that the level of institutional herding in corporate bonds is substantially higher than what is documented for equities, and that sell herding is much stronger and more persistent than buy herding. The price impact of herding is also highly asymmetric. While buy herding facilitates price discovery, sell herding causes transitory yet large price distortions. Such price destabilizing effect of sell herding is particularly pronounced for speculative-grade, small, and illiquid bonds, and during the financial crisis.","['Fang Cai', 'Song Han', 'Dan Li', 'Yi Li']","['Corporate bond', 'Herding', 'Institutional investors', 'Return reversal']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301995,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,1,Fang Cai,2019,169.88699777329293
Institutional investor cliques and governance,"We examine the impact of investor coordination on governance. We identify coordinating groups of investors (cliques) as those connected through the network of institutional holdings. Clique members vote together on proxy items: a one standard deviation increase in clique ownership more than doubles votes against low quality management proposals. We use the 2003 mutual fund trading scandal to show that this effect is causal. These findings suggest coordination strengthens governance via voice. Coordination, however, also weakens governance via threat of exit. Clique owners exit positions more slowly, and firm value responds negatively to liquidity shocks when clique ownership is high.","['Alan D.

Transparency and dealer networks: Evidence from the initiation of post-trade reporting in the mortgage backed security market,"We examine the introduction of mandatory post-trade reporting in the To-Be-Announced mortgage-backed securities market. With post-trade reporting, trading costs fell for institutional investors. Trading costs declined more for investors’ trades with peripheral dealers than for their trades with core dealers. Peripheral dealers’ market share dropped after the introduction of post-trade reporting, suggesting that opacity was protecting inefficient high-cost dealers. Interdealer trades and volume declined as transparency made it easier to find natural counterparties. Relationships between dealers became less important and, after controlling for the number of trades, dealers used more counterparties in interdealer trades.","['Paul Schultz', 'Zhaogang Song']","['Dealer market', 'Transparency', 'Mortgage backed securities', 'Core-periphery']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300078,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,1,Paul Schultz,2019,169.88699777329293
The rise in student loan defaults,"We examine the rise in student loan defaults in the Great Recession by linking administrative student loan data at the individual borrower level to student loan borrowers’ individual tax records. A Blinder-Oaxaca style decomposition shows that shifts in the composition of student loan borrowers and the massive collapse in home prices during the Great Recession can each account for approximately 30% of the rise in student loan defaults. Falling home prices affect student loan defaults by impairing individuals’ labor earnings, especially for low income jobs. By contrast, when comparing the default sensitivities of homeowners and renters, we find no evidence that falling home prices affect student loan defaults through a home equity-based liquidity channel. The Income Based Repayment (IBR) program introduced by the federal government in the wake of the Great Recession reduced both student loan defaults and their sensitivity to home price fluctuations, thus providing student loan borrowers with valuable insurance against negative shocks.","['Holger M.

Crowdsourced employer reviews and stock returns,"We find that firms experiencing improvements in crowdsourced employer ratings significantly outperform firms with declines. The return effect is concentrated among reviews from current employees, stronger among early firm reviews, and also stronger when the employee works in the headquarters state. Decomposing employer ratings, we find the return effect is related to changing employee assessments of Career Opportunities and views of senior management. It is unrelated to work-life balance. Employer rating changes are associated with growth in sales and profitability and help forecast one-quarter-ahead earnings announcement surprises.

Does social capital mitigate agency problems? Evidence from Chief Executive Officer (CEO) compensation,"We find that social capital, as captured by secular norms and social networks surrounding corporate headquarters, is negatively associated with levels of CEO compensation. This relation holds in a range of robustness tests including those that address omitted variable bias and reverse causality. Additionally, social capital reduces the likelihood that firms make opportunistic option grant awards that unduly favor CEOs, including lucky awards, backdated awards, and unscheduled awards. Social capital also lessens the accretive effect of CEO power on CEO compensation.

Attention allocation and return co-movement: Evidence from repeated natural experiments,"We hypothesize that when investors pay less attention to financial markets, they rationally allocate relatively more attention to market-level information than to firm-specific information, leading to increases in stock return co-movements. Using large jackpot lotteries as exogenous shocks that attract investors’ attention away from the stock market, we find supportive evidence that stock returns co-move more with the market on large jackpot days. This effect is stronger for stocks preferred by retail investors and is not driven by gambling sentiment. We also find that stock returns are less sensitive to earnings surprises and co-move more with industries on large jackpot days.","['Shiyang Huang', 'Yulin Huang', 'Tse-Chun Lin']","['Lottery jackpots', 'Attention shocks', 'Attention allocation', 'Return co-movement', 'Earnings surprises']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302848,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,2,Shiyang Huang,2019,169.88699777329293
Inferring latent social networks from stock holdings,"We infer the latent social networks of investors using data on their stock holdings. We map linkages to portfolio weights using a portfolio-choice model. The precision of an investor’s private signal about firm value is assumed to increase with his connections in the city where the firm is headquartered. Using money-manager data, we find that managerial linkages to a city are overly dispersed relative to the Erdös–Rényi model of i.i.d. connections. Managers at the tail of this distribution with non-i.i.d. linkages have more university alumni in that city.

A tug of war: Overnight versus intraday expected returns,"We link investor heterogeneity to the persistence of the overnight and intraday components of returns. We document strong overnight and intraday firm-level return continuation along with an offsetting cross-period reversal effect, all of which lasts for years. We look for a similar tug of war in the returns of 14 trading strategies, finding in all cases that profits are either earned entirely overnight (for reversal and a variety of momentum strategies) or entirely intraday, typically with profits of opposite signs across these components. We argue that this tug of war should reduce the effectiveness of clienteles pursuing the strategy. Indeed, the smoothed spread between the overnight and intraday return components of a strategy generally forecasts time variation in that strategy’s close-to-close performance in a manner consistent with that interpretation. Finally, we link cross-sectional and time-series variation in the decomposition of momentum profits to a specific institutional tug of war.","['Dong Lou', 'Christopher Polk', 'Spyros Skouras']","['Anomalies', 'Overnight returns', 'Intraday returns', 'Investor clienteles']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300650,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,1,Dong Lou,2019,169.88699777329293
Optimal capital structure and bankruptcy choice: Dynamic bargaining versus liquidation,"We model a firm’s optimal capital structure decision in a framework in which it may later choose to enter either Chapter 11 reorganization or Chapter 7 liquidation. Creditors anticipate equityholders’ ex-post reorganization incentives and price them into the ex-ante credit spreads. Using a realistic dynamic bargaining model of reorganization, we show that the off-equilibrium threat of costly renegotiation can lead to lower leverage, even with liquidation in equilibrium. If reorganization is less efficient than liquidation, the added option of reorganization can actually make equityholders worse off ex-ante, even when they liquidate on the equilibrium path.","['Samuel Antill', 'Steven R.

Entrusted loans: A close look at China's shadow banking system,"We perform transaction-level analyses of entrusted loans, one of the largest components of shadow banking in China. Entrusted loans involve firms with privileged access to cheap capital channeling funds to less privileged firms, and the increase when credit is tight. Nonaffiliated loans have much higher interest rates than both affiliated loans and official bank loans, and they largely flow into real estate. The pricing of entrusted loans, especially of nonaffiliated loans, incorporates fundamental and informational risks. Stock market reactions suggest that both affiliated and nonaffiliated loans are fairly compensated investments.","['Franklin Allen', 'Yiming Qian', 'Guoqian Tu', 'Frank Yu']","['Shadow banking', 'Entrusted loans', 'Credit shortage', 'Fundamental risk', 'Informational risk']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300066,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,1,Franklin Allen,2019,169.88699777329293
Characteristics are covariances: A unified model of risk and return,"We propose a new modeling approach for the cross section of returns. Our method, Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA), allows for latent factors and time-varying loadings by introducing observable characteristics that instrument for the unobservable dynamic loadings. If the characteristics/expected return relationship is driven by compensation for exposure to latent risk factors, IPCA will identify the corresponding latent factors. If no such factors exist, IPCA infers that the characteristic effect is compensation without risk and allocates it to an “anomaly” intercept. Studying returns and characteristics at the stock-level, we find that five IPCA factors explain the cross section of average returns significantly more accurately than existing factor models and produce characteristic-associated anomaly intercepts that are small and statistically insignificant. Furthermore, among a large collection of characteristics explored in the literature, only ten are statistically significant at the 1% level in the IPCA specification and are responsible for nearly 100% of the model’s accuracy.","['Bryan T.

Do insiders time management buyouts and freezeouts to buy undervalued targets?,"We provide evidence that managers and controlling shareholders time management buyouts (MBOs) and freezeout transactions to take advantage of industry-wide undervaluation. Portfolios of industry peers of MBO and freezeout targets show significant alphas of around 1% per month over the 12-month period following the transaction. These returns are not explained by a battery of risk factors or empirical methodologies, but exhibit significant heterogeneity across deals.

How valuable are independent directors? Evidence from external distractions,"We provide new evidence on the value of independent directors by exploiting exogenous events that seriously distract independent directors. Approximately 20% of independent directors are significantly distracted in a typical year. They attend fewer meetings, trade less frequently in the firm's stock, and resign from the board more frequently, indicating declining firm-specific knowledge and a reduced board commitment. Firms with more preoccupied independent directors have declining firm valuation and operating performance and exhibit weaker merger and acquisition (M&A) profitability and accounting quality. These effects are stronger when distracted independent directors play key board monitoring roles and when firms require greater director attention.","['Ronald W.

Financial frictions and employment during the Great Depression,"We provide new evidence that a disruption in credit supply played a quantitatively significant role in the unprecedented contraction of employment during the Great Depression using a novel, hand-collected dataset of large industrial firms. Our identification strategy exploits preexisting variation in the need to raise external funds at a time when public bond markets essentially froze. Local bank failures inhibited firms’ ability to substitute public debt for private debt, which exacerbated financial constraints. We estimate a large and negative causal effect of financing frictions on firm employment. We find that the lack of access to credit likely accounted for a substantial fraction of the aggregate decline in employment of large firms between 1928 and 1933.","['Efraim Benmelech', 'Carola Frydman', 'Dimitris Papanikolaou']","['Credit', 'Financial constraints', 'Labor', 'Unemployment', 'Great Depression']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300388,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,3,Efraim Benmelech,2019,169.88699777329293
Indexing and stock market serial dependence around the world,"We show a striking change in index return serial dependence across 20 major market indexes covering 15 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. While many studies find serial dependence to be positive until the 1990s, it switches to negative since the 2000s. This change happens in most stock markets around the world and is both statistically significant and economically meaningful. Further tests reveal that the decline in serial dependence links to the increasing popularity of index products (e.g., futures, exchange-traded funds, and index mutual funds). The link between serial dependence and indexing is not driven by a time trend, holds up in the cross section of stock indexes, is confirmed by tests exploiting Nikkei 225 index weights and Standard & Poor’s 500 membership, and in part reflects the arbitrage mechanism between index products and the underlying stocks.","['Guido Baltussen', 'Sjoerd van Bekkum', 'Zhi Da']","['Return autocorrelation', 'Stock market indexing', 'Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)', 'Arbitrage']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302034,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,132,1,Guido Baltussen,2019,169.88699777329293
Channels of US monetary policy spillovers to international bond markets,"We show significant US monetary policy (MP) spillovers to international bond markets. Our methodology identifies US MP shocks as the change in short-term Treasury yields around Federal Open Market Committee meetings and traces their effects on international bond yields using panel regressions. We emphasize three main results. First, US MP spillovers to long-term yields have increased substantially after the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. Second, spillovers are large compared with the effects of other events, and at least as large as the effects of domestic MP after 2008. Third, spillovers work through different channels, concentrated in risk-neutral rates (expectations of future MP rates) for developed countries, but predominantly on term premia in emerging markets. In interpreting these findings, we provide evidence consistent with an exchange rate channel, according to which foreign central banks face a trade-off between narrowing MP rate differentials or experiencing currency movements against the US dollar. Developed countries adjust in a manner consistent with freely floating regimes, responding partially with risk-neutral rates and partially through currency adjustments. Instead, emerging countries display patterns consistent with foreign exchange interventions, which cushion the response of exchange rates but reinforce capital flows and their effects in bond yields through movements in term premia. Our results suggest that the endogenous effects of currency interventions on long-term yields should be added into the standard cost-benefit analysis of such policies.","['Elias Albagli', 'Luis Ceballos', 'Sebastian Claro', 'Damian Romero']","['Monetary policy spillovers', 'Risk-neutral rates', 'Term premia']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301072,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,2,Elias Albagli,2019,169.88699777329293
Credit default swaps and corporate innovation,"We show that credit default swap (CDS) trading on a firm's debt positively influences its technological innovation output measured by patents and patent citations. This positive effect is more pronounced in firms relying more on debt financing or being more subject to continuous monitoring by lenders prior to CDS trade initiation. Moreover, after CDS trade initiation, firms pursue more risky and original innovations and generate patents with higher economic value. Further analysis suggests that CDSs improve borrowing firms’ innovation output by enhancing lenders’ risk tolerance and borrowers’ risk- taking in the innovation process, rather than by increasing Research and Development (R&D) investment. Taken together, our findings reveal the real effects of CDSs on companies’ investments and technological progress.","['Xin Chang', 'Yangyang Chen', 'Sarah Qian Wang', 'Kuo Zhang', 'Wenrui Zhang']","['Credit default swaps', 'Corporate innovation', 'Risk-taking', 'Financial innovation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300856,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,2,Xin Chang,2019,169.88699777329293
Do idiosyncratic jumps matter?,"We show that idiosyncratic jumps are a key determinant of mean stock returns from both an ex post and ex ante perspective. Ex post, the entire annual average return of a typical stock accrues on the four days on which its price jumps. Ex ante, idiosyncratic jump risk earns a premium: a value-weighted weekly long-short portfolio that buys (sells) stocks with high (low) predicted jump probabilities earns annualized mean returns of 9.4% and four-factor alphas of 8.1%. This strategy’s returns are larger when there are greater limits to arbitrage. These results are consistent with investor aversion to idiosyncratic jump risk.","['Nishad Kapadia', 'Morad Zekhnini']","['Idiosyncratic jumps', 'Idiosyncratic risk', 'Limits to arbitrage']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302393,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,3,Nishad Kapadia,2019,169.88699777329293
Why did the q theory of investment start working?,"We show that the relation between aggregate investment and Tobin’s q has become remarkably tight in recent years, contrasting with earlier times. We connect this change with the growing empirical dispersion in Tobin’s q, which we show both in the cross-section and the time series. To study the source of this dispersion, we augment a standard investment model with two distinct mechanisms related to firms’ research activities: innovations and learning. Both innovation jumps in cash flows and the frequent updating of beliefs about future cash flows endogenously amplify volatility in the firm’s value function. Perhaps counterintuitively, the investment-q regression works better for research-intensive industries, a growing segment of the economy, despite their greater stock of intangible assets. We confirm the model’s predictions in the data, and we disentangle the results from measurement error in q.","['Daniel Andrei', 'William Mann', 'Nathalie Moyen']","['Investment', 'Tobin’s q', 'Research and development', 'Innovation', 'Learning']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300613,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,2,Daniel Andrei,2019,169.88699777329293
Regulating a model,"We study a situation in which a regulator relies on risk models that banks produce in order to regulate them. A bank can generate more than one model and choose which models to reveal to the regulator. The regulator can find out the other models by monitoring the bank, but in equilibrium, monitoring induces the bank to produce less information. We show that a high level of monitoring is desirable when the bank’s private gain from producing more information is either sufficiently high or sufficiently low. When public models are more precise, banks produce more information, but the regulator may end up monitoring more.","['Yaron Leitner', 'Bilge Yilmaz']","['Bank regulation', 'Bayesian persuasion', 'Information design', 'Internal-risk models', 'Model-based regulation', 'Stress tests']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302319,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,2,Yaron Leitner,2019,169.88699777329293
The present value relation over six centuries: The case of the Bazacle company,"We study asset pricing over the longue durée using share prices and net dividends from the Bazacle company of Toulouse, the earliest documented shareholding corporation. The data extend from the firm’s foundation in 1372 to its nationalization in 1946. We find an average dividend yield of 5% per annum and near-zero long-term, real capital appreciation. Stationary dividends and stock prices enable us to directly study how prices relate to expected cash flows, without relying on a rate of return transformation. A reduced-form asset pricing model with persistent dividends and a time-varying risk correction is not rejected by the data.","['David le Bris', 'William N.

Mutual fund board connections and proxy voting,"We study fund-firm connections that arise when firm executives and directors serve as fund directors. We find that connected funds are significantly more likely to vote with management in proposals with negative Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommendations or low shareholder support. As our data show that management support does not exist either before connection formation or after its termination, this result is unlikely to be caused by omitted factors. Rather, the connected fund's voting patterns show independence from ISS recommendations and successful connected voting is associated with positive announcement returns, suggesting that connected fund support for management reflects information advantages. Lastly, we find that a fund family and firm are more likely to connect when the fund family holds a large stake in the firm and is geographically proximate as well as when it has a record of voting independently from ISS.","['Paul Calluzzo', 'Simi Kedia']","['Proxy voting', 'Board connections', 'Mutual funds']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301126,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,3,Paul Calluzzo,2019,169.88699777329293
"Good disclosure, bad disclosure","We study real-efficiency implications of disclosing public information in a model with multiple dimensions of uncertainty where market prices convey information to a real decision maker. Paradoxically, when disclosure concerns a variable that the real decision maker cares to learn about, disclosure negatively affects price informativeness, and in markets that are effective in aggregating private information, this negative price-informativeness effect can dominate so that better disclosure negatively impacts real efficiency. When disclosure concerns a variable that the real decision maker already knows much about, disclosure always improves price informativeness and real efficiency. Our analysis has important empirical and policy implications for different contexts such as disclosure of stress test information and regulation of credit ratings.","['Itay Goldstein', 'Liyan Yang']","['Disclosure', 'Price informativeness', 'Learning', 'Real efficiency']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302241,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,1,Itay Goldstein,2019,169.88699777329293
Interconnectedness in the interbank market,"We study the behavior of the interbank market around the 2008 financial crisis. Using network analysis, we study two network structures, correlation networks based on publicly traded bank returns and physical networks based on interbank lending transactions, among these public and also private banks. While the two networks behave similarly pre-crisis, during the crisis the correlation network shows an increase in interconnectedness, while the physical network highlights a marked decrease in interconnectedness. Moreover, these networks respond differently to monetary and macroeconomic shocks. Physical networks forecast liquidity problems, while correlation networks forecast financial crises.","['Celso Brunetti', 'Jeffrey H.

Firms’ innovation strategy under the shadow of analyst coverage,"We study the effect of analyst coverage on firms’ innovation strategy and outcome. Using data of US firms from 1990 to 2012, we find evidence that an increase in financial analysts leads firms to cut research and development expenses, acquire more innovative firms, and invest in corporate venture capital. We attribute the first result to the effect of analyst pressure and the others to the informational role of analysts. We also find that financial analysts encourage firms to make more efficient investments related to innovation, which increases their future patents and citations and influences the novelty of their innovations.","['Bing Guo', 'David Pérez-Castrillo', 'Anna Toldrà-Simats']","['Financial analysts', 'Innovation', 'Corporate venture capital', 'Acquisition']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302265,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,2,Bing Guo,2019,169.88699777329293
"Securitized markets, international capital flows, and global welfare","We study the effect of collateralized lending and securitization on international capital flows and welfare in a two-country general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic investment risk. The low-margin country (Home) endogenously supplies more safe assets and enables more risk sharing. Upon financial integration, capital flows from Foreign (high-margin country) to Home, leading to lower interest rates and a larger global supply of safe assets. Unlike in standard models with partial equity issuance, in our model, Home can lose from financial integration due to the endogenous reduction in risk sharing and aggregate shocks can generate large gross capital flows.","['Gregory Phelan', 'Alexis Akira Toda']","['Collateralized loan obligations', 'Endogenous risk sharing', 'Global imbalances', 'Gross international asset positions']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302320,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,131,3,Gregory Phelan,2019,169.88699777329293

We disentangle the effects of the Stulz (2005) “twin agency problems” in the context of foreign direct investment and show that our results are not driven by legal institutions protecting investors from expropriation by corporate insiders.

Private equity and human capital risk,"We study the human capital effects of private equity buyouts in Germany. We conduct matched-sample difference-in-differences estimations at the establishment and at the individual employee level with more than 152 thousand buyout employees and a carefully matched control group. Buyouts are followed by a reduction in overall employment and an increase in employee turnover. Employees of buyout targets experience earnings declines equivalent to 2.8% of median earnings in the fifth year after the buyout. Managers and older employees fare far worse after buyouts compared with the average target employee, even though they are not more likely to lose their jobs at the target compared with other employees. We argue that the employees most negatively affected after buyouts are those who are less likely to find new employment, not those who are most likely to lose their jobs. Evidence exists of a reduction in administrative staff and more hiring for jobs that require IT skills.","['Manfred Antoni', 'Ernst Maug', 'Stefan Obernberger']","['Private equity', 'Restructuring', 'Human capital risk', 'Buyouts', 'Wages']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301102,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,3,Manfred Antoni,2019,169.88699777329293

A capital structure channel of monetary policy,"We study the transmission channels from central banks’ quantitative easing programs via the banking sector when central banks start purchasing corporate bonds. We find evidence consistent with a “capital structure channel” of monetary policy. The announcement of central bank purchases reduces the bond yields of firms whose bonds are eligible for central bank purchases. These firms substitute bank term loans with bond debt, thereby relaxing banks’ lending constraints: banks with low tier-1 ratios and high nonperforming loans increase lending to private (and profitable) firms, which experience a growth in investment. The credit reallocation increases banks’ risk-taking in corporate credit.","['Benjamin Grosse-Rueschkamp', 'Sascha Steffen', 'Daniel Streitz']","['Debt capital structure', 'Bond debt', 'Unconventional monetary policy', 'Quantitative easing', 'Real effects']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300601,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,2,Benjamin Grosse-Rueschkamp,2019,169.88699777329293

To do so, we identify accounts of industry insiders in a large data set provided by a retail discount broker. We find that insiders trade firms from their own industry more frequently. Furthermore, they earn abnormal returns exclusively when trading own-industry stocks, especially obscure stocks (small, low analyst coverage, high volatility). In a battery of tests, we find no evidence of the use of private information.

Experience derives from investments in banks that defaulted following the 2007–2009 financial crisis.

We find that bear beta (exposure to bear market risk) has a strong relation with expected stock returns that is robust, persistent, and remains strong among liquid and large stocks.

Do real estate agents have information advantages in housing markets?,"We use a large housing transaction data set in Singapore to study whether real estate agents use information advantages to buy houses at bargain prices. Agents bought their own houses at prices that are 2.54% lower than comparable houses bought by other buyers. Consistent with information asymmetries, agent buyers have more information advantages in less informative environments, and agent buyers are more likely to buy houses from agent sellers. Agent discounts are from both “cherry picking” and bargaining power, and bargaining power contributes more to the agent discounts. Agents’ advantage consists in their information of available houses and previous purchase prices.","['Sumit Agarwal', 'Jia He', 'Tien Foo Sing', 'Changcheng Song']","['Housing market', 'Real estate agents', 'Information advantages', 'Bargaining power', 'Market distortion']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301229,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,3,Sumit Agarwal,2019,169.88699777329293
Who benefits in a crisis? Evidence from hedge fund stock and option holdings,"We use a unique data set of hedge fund long equity and equity option positions to investigate a significant lockup-related premium earned during the tech bubble (1999–2001) and financial crisis (2007–2009). Net fund flows are significantly greater among lockup funds during crisis and noncrisis periods. Managers of hedge funds with locked-up capital trade opportunistically against flow-motivated trades of non-lockup managers, consistent with a hypothesis of rent extraction in providing crisis era liquidity. The success of this opportunistic trading is concentrated during periods of high borrowing costs, in less liquid stock markets, and is enhanced by hedging in the equity option market.","['George O.

Drivers of effort: Evidence from employee absenteeism,"We use detailed information on individual absent spells of all employees in 4140 firms in Denmark to show large differences in average absenteeism across firms. Using employees who switch firms, we decompose days absent into an individual component (e.g., motivation, work ethic) and a firm component (e.g., incentives, corporate culture). We find the firm component explains 50%–60% of the difference in absenteeism across firms, with the individual component explaining the rest. We present suggestive evidence of the mechanisms behind the firm effect with family firm status and concentrated ownership strongly correlated with decreases in absenteeism. We also analyze the firm characteristics that correlate with the individual effect and find that firms with stronger career incentives attract lower-absenteeism employees.","['Morten Bennedsen', 'Margarita Tsoutsoura', 'Daniel Wolfenzon']","['Family firms', 'Organizational structure', 'Employee effort']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303222,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,133,3,Morten Bennedsen,2019,169.88699777329293
"A tale of two volatilities: Sectoral uncertainty, growth, and asset prices","What is the impact of higher technological volatility on asset prices and macroeconomic aggregates? I find the answer hinges on its sectoral origin. Volatility that originates from the consumption (investment) sector drops (raises) macroeconomic growth rates and stock prices. Moreover, consumption (investment) sector’s technological volatility has a positive (negative) market price of risk. I show that a quantitative two-sector DSGE model that features monopolistic power for firms and sticky prices, as well as early resolution of uncertainty, can explain the differential impact of sectoral volatilities on real and financial variables. In all, the sectoral decomposition of volatility can overturn the typical negative relation between aggregate volatility and economic activity.",['Gill Segal'],"['Volatility', 'Investment shocks', 'Asset pricing', 'Economic growth']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930056X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.159193324849707,134,1,Gill Segal,2019,169.88699777329293
Expectation and duration at the effective lower bound,"With risk-averse arbitrageurs and an effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal rates, nonlinear interactions among short-rate expectations, bond supply, and term premia emerge in equilibrium. These interactions, which are absent from affine models, help explain the observed behavior of the yield curve near the ELB, including evidence about unconventional monetary policy. The impact of both short-rate expectations and bond supply are attenuated at the ELB. However, in simulations of the post-crisis experience in the U.S., shocks to investors’ duration-risk exposures have much smaller effects than shocks to the anticipated path of short rates. The latter shocks matter, in part, because of the reduction in interest-rate volatility associated with a longer expected stay at the ELB—a novel channel of unconventional policy.",['Thomas B.

Using a more comprehensive measure of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) incentives for short-termism, we uncover evidence that short-termism indeed played a role. Firms whose CEOs were contractually allowed to sell or exercise more of their stock and options holdings sooner had more subprime exposure, a higher probability of financial distress, and lower risk-adjusted stock returns during the crisis, as well as higher fines and settlements for subprime-related fraud.","['Adam C.

Downside risks and the cross-section of asset returns,"In an intertemporal equilibrium asset pricing model featuring disappointment aversion and changing macroeconomic uncertainty, we show that besides the market return and market volatility, three disappointment-related factors are also priced: a downstate factor, a market downside factor, and a volatility downside factor. We find that expected returns on various asset classes reflect premiums for bearing undesirable exposures to these factors. The signs of estimated risk premiums are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Our most general, five-factor model is very successful in jointly pricing stock, option, and currency portfolios, and provides considerable improvement over nested specifications previously discussed in the literature.","['Adam Farago', 'Roméo Tédongap']","['Generalized disappointment aversion', 'Downside risks', 'Cross-section']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300813,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,129,1,Adam Farago,2018,169.802853643638
Government guarantees and the two-way feedback between banking and sovereign debt crises,"This paper studies the effects of government guarantees on the interconnection between banking and sovereign debt crises in a framework where both the banks and the government are fragile and the credibility and feasibility of the guarantees are determined endogenously. The analysis delivers some new results on the role of guarantees in the bank-sovereign nexus. First, guarantees emerge as a key channel linking banks’ and sovereign stability, even in the absence of banks’ holdings of sovereign bonds. Second, depending on the specific characteristics of the economy and the nature of banking crises, an increase in the size of guarantees can be beneficial for the bank-sovereign nexus in that it enhances financial stability without undermining sovereign solvency.",['Agnese Leonello'],"['Bank runs', 'Sovereign default', 'Strategic complementarity', 'Government bond yield']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300977,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,3,Agnese Leonello,2018,169.802853643638
Network centrality and delegated investment performance,"We show a positive relation between network centrality and risk-adjusted performance in a delegated investment management setting. More connected managers take more portfolio risk and receive higher investor flows, consistent with these managers improving their ability to exploit investment opportunities through their network connections. Greater network connections are shown to be particularly important in reducing the diseconomies of scale for large managers who are well connected. We also use the exogenous merger of two investment consultants, which creates a sudden change in the network connections of the managers they oversee, to provide evidence that a greater number of connections translates into better portfolio performance.","['Alberto G.

Stocks with extreme past returns: Lotteries or insurance?,"The paper shows that lottery-like stocks are hedges against unexpected increases in market volatility. The loading on the aggregate volatility risk factor explains the majority of low abnormal returns to stocks with high maximum returns in the past month (Bali et al., 2011) and high expected skewness (Boyer et al., 2010).

"Company stock price reactions to the 2016 election shock: Trump, taxes, and trade","Donald Trump's surprise election shifted expectations: corporate taxes would be lower and trade policies more restrictive. Relative stock prices responded appropriately. High-tax firms and those with large deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) gained; those with significant deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards (NOL DTAs) lost. Domestically focused companies fared better than internationally oriented firms. A price contribution analysis shows that easily assessed consequences (DTLs, NOL DTAs, tax rates) were priced faster than more complex issues (net DTLs, foreign exposure).

Does policy uncertainty affect mergers and acquisitions?,"Political and regulatory uncertainty is strongly negatively associated with merger and acquisition activity at the macro and firm levels. The strongest effects are for uncertainty regarding taxes, government spending, monetary and fiscal policies, and regulation. Consistent with a real options channel, the effect is exacerbated for less reversible deals and for firms whose product demand or stock returns exhibit greater sensitivity to policy uncertainty, but attenuated for deals that cannot be delayed due to competition and for deals that hedge firm-level risk. Contractual mechanisms (deal premiums, termination fees, MAC clauses) unanimously point to policy uncertainty increasing the target’s negotiating power.","['Alice Bonaime', 'Huseyin Gulen', 'Mihai Ion']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Policy uncertainty', 'Real options']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301338,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,129,3,Alice Bonaime,2018,169.802853643638
How does hedge fund activism reshape corporate innovation?,"This paper studies how hedge fund activism impacts corporate innovation. Firms targeted by activists improve their innovation efficiency over the five-year period following hedge fund intervention. Despite a tightening in research and development (R&D) expenditures, target firms increase innovation output, as measured by both patent counts and citations, with stronger effects among firms with more diversified innovation portfolios. Reallocation of innovative resources, redeployment of human capital, and change to board-level expertise all contribute to improve target firms’ innovation. Additional tests help isolate the effect of intervention from alternative explanations, including mean reversion, sample attrition, voluntary reforms, or activist stock-picking.","['Alon Brav', 'Wei Jiang', 'Song Ma', 'Xuan Tian']","['Hedge fund activism', 'Innovation', 'Resource allocation', 'Human capital redeployment']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301727,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,2,Alon Brav,2018,169.802853643638
What makes the bonding stick? A natural experiment testing the legal bonding hypothesis,"We use a US Supreme Court case, Morrison v. National Australia Bank (2010), as a natural experiment to test the legal bonding hypothesis. By decreasing the potential liability of US-listed foreign firms, particularly due to class action lawsuits, Morrison arguably eroded their legal bonding to compliance with disclosure duties. Nevertheless, we find evidence of an increase or insignificant change in share values. Tests of longer-run effects of the legal event indicate that foreign firms’ disclosure quality and likelihood of facing enforcement actions remained stable, as did investors’ revealed preferences for trading on US markets. These results go against the legal bonding hypothesis but are consistent with reputational bonding and with market-based accounts of US cross-listing. Our results may contribute to ongoing debate about civil enforcement of securities laws through class actions.","['Amir N. Licht', 'Christopher Poliquin', 'Jordan I.

The real effects of credit default swaps,"We examine the effect of introducing credit default swaps (CDSs) on firm value. Our model allows for dynamic investment and financing, and bondholders can trade in the CDS market. The model incorporates both negative and positive effects of CDSs. CDS markets lead to more liquidations, but they also reduce the probability of costly debt renegotiation and reduce costly equity financing. After calibrating the model, we find that firm value increases by 2.9% on average with the introduction of a CDS market. Firms also invest more and increase leverage. The effect on firm value is strongest for small, financially constrained, and low productivity firms.","['András Danis', 'Andrea Gamba']","['Credit default swaps', 'CDS', 'Empty creditor', 'Restructuring', 'Bankruptcy']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302556,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,1,András Danis,2018,169.802853643638

Taxation and executive compensation: Evidence from stock options,"Understanding the effects of taxes on executive compensation provides insight into the process determining this compensation and is a key input to top income tax rate policy. A 2010 tax reform in Canada, which greatly increased the effective tax rate on stock option compensation for a subset of firms, provides a natural experiment with which to address this issue. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest that this tax increase resulted in an immediate reduction in both stock option grants and the fraction of total compensation made up of stock options with limited, if any, substitution towards other components of compensation.",['Andrew Bird'],"['Executive compensation', 'Taxation', 'Stock options']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302945,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,2,Andrew Bird,2018,169.802853643638
Liquidity risk and maturity management over the credit cycle,"We show that firm demand-side factors are strong drivers of procyclical refinancing behavior over the credit cycle using novel data from the Shared National Credit program. Firms are more likely to refinance early when credit conditions are good to keep the effective maturity of their loans long and hedge against having to refinance in tight credit conditions. High credit quality firms are better able to hedge, making their refinancing propensity more sensitive to credit cycles than less creditworthy firms. There is a strong relationship between refinancing a loan, and subsequent growth in capital expenditure, especially when a loan is refinanced early.","['Atif Mian', 'João A.C.

Are stock-financed takeovers opportunistic?,"The more the target knows about the bidder, the more difficult is paying the target with overpriced bidder shares. Thus, when bidders are opportunistic, the fraction of stock in the deal payment will be lower for better informed targets. We test this intuitive prediction against the alternative that stock payments primarily reflect bidder concerns with target adverse selection, which implies a greater fraction of stock in the deal payment for better informed targets. Discriminating between these two mutually exclusive and nested predictions requires measures of target information about the bidder but not of market mispricing. We find that public bidders systematically use more stock in the payment when the target knows more about the bidder. Tests exploiting exogenous variation in bidder market-to-book ratios also fail to support bidder opportunism. Finally, greater potential competition from private bidders is associated with greater propensity for public bidders to pay in cash.","['B. Espen Eckbo', 'Tanakorn Makaew', 'Karin S.

Cash windfalls and acquisitions,"This article studies the effect of cash windfalls on the acquisition policy of companies. As identification, I use a German tax reform that permitted firms to sell their equity stakes tax free. Companies that could realize a cash windfall by selling equity stakes see an increase in the probability of acquiring another company by 14%. I find that these additional acquisitions destroy firm value. Following the tax reform, affected firms experience a decrease of 1.2 percentage points in acquisition announcement returns. These effects are stronger for larger cash windfalls.

Four centuries of return predictability,"We combine annual stock market data for the most important equity markets of the last four centuries: the Netherlands and UK (1629–1812), UK (1813–1870), and US (1871–2015). We show that dividend yields are stationary and consistently forecast returns. The documented predictability holds for annual and multi-annual horizons and works both in- and out-of-sample, providing strong evidence that expected returns in stock markets are time-varying. In part, this variation is related to the business cycle, with expected returns increasing in recessions. We also find that, except for the period after 1945, dividend yields predict dividend growth rates.","['Benjamin Golez', 'Peter Koudijs']","['Dividend-to-price ratio', 'Return predictability', 'Dividend growth predictability']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303185,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,2,Benjamin Golez,2018,169.802853643638
"The consequences of managerial indiscretions: Sex, lies, and firm value","Personal managerial indiscretions are separate from a firm's business activities but provide information about the manager's integrity. Consequently, they could affect counterparties’ trust in the firm and the firm's value and operations. We find that companies of accused executives experience significant wealth deterioration, reduced operating margins, and lost business partners. Indiscretions are also associated with an increased probability of unrelated shareholder-initiated lawsuits, Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations, and managed earnings. Further, chief executive officers and boards face labor market consequences, including forced turnover, pay cuts, and lower shareholder votes at re-election.

The buyers’ perspective on security design: Hedge funds and convertible bond call provisions,"We provide evidence that security design reflects the interplay of capital supplier and security issuer preferences. While call provisions have historically been the default option in convertible security design, only a minority of post-2005 issues are callable. Because hedge funds dominate the market for new convertibles today and because convertible arbitrage is less risky without callability, the recent diminution in the frequency of call provisions in new convertible bond issues illustrates the importance of the preferences of the suppliers of capital in security design.","['Bruce D.

In search of ideas: Technological innovation and executive pay inequality,"We develop a general equilibrium model that delivers realistic fluctuations in pay inequality as a result of changes in the technology frontier. In our model, executives add value to the firm not only by participating in production decisions, as do other workers in the economy, but also by identifying new investment opportunities. Improvements in technology that are specific to new vintages of capital raise the return to managers’ skills for discovering new growth projects and, thus, increase the compensation of executives relative to workers and disparities in pay across executives. Our model implies that, controlling for firm size, compensation is higher in fast-growing firms and that pay inequality increases as investment opportunities in the economy improve. Both predictions are consistent with the data.","['Carola Frydman', 'Dimitris Papanikolaou']","['Executive compensation', 'Inequality', 'Technology', 'Innovation']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301740,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,1,Carola Frydman,2018,169.802853643638
Regulating dark trading: Order flow segmentation and market quality,"We examine the impact of a rule in the Canadian equities market that requires dark orders to offer price improvement over displayed orders. We show that this rule eliminated intermediation of retail orders in the dark and shifted retail orders onto the lit market with the lowest trading fee. Intermediaries shifted liquidity supply to this market leading to increased displayed liquidity. We conclude that reducing retail order segmentation enhances lit liquidity. Despite the improvement in liquidity, retail traders receive less price improvement. Retail brokers pay higher trading fees to exchanges, and high-frequency traders earn higher revenues from trading fees.","['Carole Comerton-Forde', 'Katya Malinova', 'Andreas Park']","['Dark trading', 'Trade-at rule', 'Price improvement', 'Segmentation', 'Retail internalization']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301788,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,2,Carole Comerton-Forde,2018,169.802853643638
Employee representation and financial leverage,"We analyze how direct employee voice affects financial leverage. German law mandates that firms’ supervisory boards consist of an equal number of employees’ and owners’ representatives. This requirement, however, applies only to firms with more than two thousand domestic employees. We exploit this discontinuity and the law’s introduction in 1976 for identification and find that direct employee power increases financial leverage. This is explained by a supply side effect: as banks’ interests are similar to those of employees, higher employee power reduces agency conflicts with debt providers, leading to better financing conditions. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of direct employee influence.","['Chen Lin', 'Thomas Schmid', 'Yuhai Xuan']","['Capital structure', 'Financial leverage', 'Employee representation', 'Labor rights', 'Bank ownership']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303136,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,2,Chen Lin,2018,169.802853643638
"Size matters, if you control your junk","The size premium has been accused of having a weak historical record, being meager relative to other factors, varying significantly over time, weakening after its discovery, being concentrated among microcap stocks, residing predominantly in January, relying on price-based measures, and being weak internationally. We find, however, that these challenges disappear when controlling for the quality, or its inverse, junk, of a firm. A significant size premium emerges, which is stable through time, robust to specification, not concentrated in microcaps, more consistent across seasons, and evident for non-price-based measures of size, and these results hold in 30 different industries and 24 international equity markets. The resurrected size effect is on par with anomalies such as value and momentum in terms of economic significance and gives rise to new tests of, and challenges for, existing asset pricing theories.","['Clifford Asness', 'Andrea Frazzini', 'Ronen Israel', 'Tobias J.

We develop a new cross-sectional identification approach, motivated by the insight that investors may differ in their “preferred habitats” within a broad asset class. We apply the method to the question of whether foreign capital is responsible for residential real estate price movements in global cities such as London and New York, especially during crises. Using large data sets of housing transactions, we find that foreign risk strongly affects London house prices.

Do universal banks finance riskier but more productive firms?,"Using variation in bank scope generated by the stepwise repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act in the US, we show that the deregulation of universal banks allowed them to finance firms with 14% higher volatility. This increase in risk is compensated by lasting improvements in firms’ total factor productivity of 3%. Using bank scope-expanding mergers to identify shocks to universal banks’ private information about borrower firms, we provide evidence that informational economies of scope across loans and non-loan products account for the firm-level real effects of universal banking.","['Daniel Neuhann', 'Farzad Saidi']","['Universal banking', 'Financial deregulation', 'Bank scope', 'Firewalls', 'Cross-selling']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300254,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,1,Daniel Neuhann,2018,169.802853643638

The average term structures reflect the dynamics of the dollar pricing kernel, cash flow growth, and the interaction between the two.

Management sub-advising in the mutual fund industry,"This is a study of how contractual mechanisms can mitigate agency conflicts in sub-advised mutual funds. Sub-advising contracts allow fund families to expand their product offerings to include new investment styles and thereby gain market share. We show that costly contractual arrangements, such as co-branding, multi-advising, and performance-based compensation, can mitigate agency conflicts in outsourcing and protect investors from potential underperformance. Fund families will find it cost-effective to implement such incentive mechanisms only when investors are sophisticated in assessing manager skill. The findings help to explain why a large percentage of fund families outsource their funds to advisory firms.","['David Moreno', 'Rosa Rodríguez', 'Rafael Zambrana']","['Outsourcing', 'Sub-advisor', 'Mutual funds', 'Management company', 'Incentive contracts', 'Fund performance', 'Market share', 'Agency issue']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300175,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,3,David Moreno,2018,169.802853643638
Corporate governance of banks and financial stability,"We find that shareholder-friendly corporate governance is associated with higher stand-alone and systemic risk in the banking sector. Specifically, shareholder-friendly corporate governance results in higher risk for larger banks and for banks that are located in countries with generous financial safety nets as banks try to shift risk toward taxpayers. We confirm our findings by comparing banks to nonfinancial firms and examining changes in bank risk around an exogenous regulatory change in governance. Our results underline the importance of the financial safety net and too-big-to-fail guarantees in thinking about corporate governance reforms at banks.","['Deniz Anginer', 'Asli Demirguc-Kunt', 'Harry Huizinga', 'Kebin Ma']","['Corporate governance', 'Bank insolvency', 'Systemic risk']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301715,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,2,Deniz Anginer,2018,169.802853643638
Inefficiencies and externalities from opportunistic acquirers,"If opportunistic acquirers can buy targets using overvalued shares, then there is an inefficiency in the merger and acquisition (M&A) market: the most overvalued rather than the highest-synergy bidder may buy the target. We quantify this inefficiency using a structural estimation approach. We find that the M&A market allocates resources efficiently on average. Opportunistic bidders crowd out high-synergy bidders in only 7% of transactions, resulting in an average synergy loss equal to 9% of the target’s value in these inefficient deals. The implied average loss across all deals is 0.63%. Although the inefficiency is small on average, it is large for certain deals, and it is larger when misvaluation is more likely. Even when opportunistic bidders lose the contest, they drive up prices, imposing a large negative externality on the winning synergistic bidders.","['Di Li', 'Lucian A.

Playing favorites: Conflicts of interest in mutual fund management,"We examine the performance of mutual funds whose managers simultaneously manage portfolios with performance-based incentive fees for three account types: mutual funds, hedge funds, and separate accounts. Importantly, our data set is free of selection bias because it is hand-collected from mandatory SEC filings. We find that only funds whose managers also manage hedge funds significantly underperform peer mutual funds. Moreover, underperformance begins only after fund managers begin to manage a hedge fund.

Choosing factors,"Our goal is to develop insights about the maximum squared Sharpe ratio for model factors as a metric for ranking asset pricing models. We consider nested and non-nested models. The nested models are the capital asset pricing model, the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993), the five-factor extension in Fama and French (2015), and a six-factor model that adds a momentum factor. The non-nested models examine three issues about factor choice in the six-factor model: (1) cash profitability versus operating profitability as the variable used to construct profitability factors, (2) long-short spread factors versus excess return factors, and (3) factors that use small or big stocks versus factors that use both.","['Eugene F.

Determinants and consequences of information processing delay: Evidence from the Thomson Reuters Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System,"We present new evidence that highlights the role of information intermediaries in the distribution and processing of earnings estimates in capital markets. We find that the time taken to activate an analyst's earnings forecast in the Thomson Reuters Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System is related to measures of investor demand for timely information processing, processing difficulty, and limited attention. Furthermore, we find that forecast announcement returns are muted and post-announcement drift is magnified for forecasts with longer unexpected activation delay and that market inefficiency is concentrated in neglected stocks and potentially exploitable. Finally, analyzing intraday returns, we find that activations facilitate price discovery.","['Ferhat Akbas', 'Stanimir Markov', 'Musa Subasi', 'Eric Weisbrod']","['Information intermediaries', 'information processing', 'limited attention', 'information distribution', 'price discovery']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302933,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,2,Ferhat Akbas,2018,169.802853643638

"Competition, reach for yield, and money market funds","Do asset managers reach for yield because of competitive pressures in a low rate environment? I propose a tournament model of money market funds (MMFs) to study this question. When funds care about relative performance, an increase in the risk premium leads funds with lower default costs to increase risk taking, while funds with higher default costs decrease risk taking. Without changes in the premium, lower risk-free rates reduce the risk taking of all funds. I show that these predictions are consistent with MMF risk taking during the 2002–2008 period and that rank-based performance is a key determinant of money flows to MMFs.",['Gabriele La Spada'],"['Reach for yield', 'Money market funds', 'Flow-performance relation', 'Tournament', 'Monetary policy']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301004,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,129,1,Gabriele La Spada,2018,169.802853643638
"Board diversity, firm risk, and corporate policies","We examine the effects of diversity in the board of directors on corporate policies and risk. Using a multidimensional measure, we find that greater board diversity leads to lower volatility and better performance. The lower risk levels are largely due to diverse boards adopting more persistent and less risky financial policies. However, consistent with diversity fostering more efficient (real) risk-taking, firms with greater board diversity also invest persistently more in research and development (R&D) and have more efficient innovation processes. Instrumental variable tests that exploit exogenous variation in firm access to the supply of diverse nonlocal directors indicate that these relations are causal.","['Gennaro Bernile', 'Vineet Bhagwat', 'Scott Yonker']","['Diversity', 'Board of directors', 'Governance', 'Firm risk', 'Performance']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303215,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,3,Gennaro Bernile,2018,169.802853643638
Threat of entry and debt maturity: Evidence from airlines,"I explore the effect of the threat posed by low-cost competitors on debt structure in the airline industry. I use the route network expansion of low-cost airlines to identify routes where the probability of future entry increases dramatically. I find that when a large portion of their market is threatened, incumbents significantly increase debt maturity before entry occurs. Overall, the main findings suggest that airlines respond to entry threats trading off the benefits of short-term financing for lower rollover risk. The results are consistent with models in which firms set their optimal debt structure in the presence of costly rollover failure.",['Gianpaolo Parise'],"['Competition', 'Debt maturity', 'Rollover risk', 'Threat of entry']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302970,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,2,Gianpaolo Parise,2018,169.802853643638
"Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks","Shadow bank market share in residential mortgage origination nearly doubled from 2007 to 2015, with particularly dramatic growth among online “fintech” lenders. We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden–capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision–all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14–16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders. A quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%.","['Greg Buchak', 'Gregor Matvos', 'Tomasz Piskorski', 'Amit Seru']","['Fintech', 'Shadow banks', 'Regulatory arbitrage', 'Lending', 'Mortgages', 'FHA']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1830237X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,3,Greg Buchak,2018,169.802853643638
Financial market frictions and diversification,"We find new facts that relate the evolution of firm scope to the changing frictions in external capital markets over the last three decades. We find that large, diversified publicly traded firms increase their scope during times of high external capital market frictions, such as in the recent Great Recession. Moreover, during these times firms diversify their investment needs and cash flow across industries. We also find similar phenomena outside diversified public firms. Examining the mergers and acquisitions activity of stand-alone and diversified private firms, we uncover similar patterns. In aggregate data, we find that the composition of mergers shifts from focused to diversifying and back with changes in external market conditions. Our evidence is broadly consistent with the notion that firms diversify their scope in response to tightening in external capital markets.","['Gregor Matvos', 'Amit Seru', 'Rui C.

Capital gains taxation and the cost of capital: Evidence from unanticipated cross-border transfers of tax base,"In a cross-border takeover, the tax base associated with future capital gains is transferred from target shareholders to acquirer shareholders. Cross-country differences in capital gains tax rates enable us to estimate the discount in target valuation on account of future capital gains. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in the capital gains tax rate reduces the value of equity by around 0.3%, which suggests that the capital gains tax significantly raises firms’ cost of capital. Furthermore, we find that the implied capital gains tax burden is higher at times of high economic growth and low stock market valuation.","['Harry Huizinga', 'Johannes Voget', 'Wolf Wagner']","['Capital gains taxation', 'Cost of capital', 'International takeovers', 'Takeover premium']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301132,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,129,2,Harry Huizinga,2018,169.802853643638

Pay me now (and later): Pension benefit manipulation before plan freezes and executive retirement,Large US firms modify top executives’ compensation before pension-related events. Top executives receive one-time increases in pensionable earnings through higher annual bonuses one year before a plan freeze and one year before retirement. Firms also boost pension payouts by lowering plan discount rates when top executives are eligible to retire with lump-sum benefit distributions. Increases in executive pensions do not appear to be an attempt to improve managerial effort or retention and are more likely to occur at firms with poor corporate governance.

After PLS is introduced, individuals who live in counties that offer PLS reduce gambling by at least 3% more than unaffected individuals. The substitution effect is stronger in low-frills gambling environments, which most resemble PLS, indicating that these accounts fulfill the desire to gamble.",['J.

Interventions by appointed regulators are less likely before competitive gubernatorial elections. Regulatory governance mechanisms that constrain the discretion of regulators reduce the delays of appointed regulators but not elected.

Data abundance and asset price informativeness,"Information processing filters out the noise in data but it takes time. Hence, low precision signals are available before high precision signals. We analyze how this feature affects asset price informativeness when investors can acquire signals of increasing precision over time about the payoff of an asset. As the cost of low precision signals declines, prices are more likely to reflect these signals before more precise signals become available. This effect can ultimately reduce price informativeness because it reduces the demand for more precise signals (e.g., fundamental analysis). We make additional predictions for trade and price patterns.","['Jérôme Dugast', 'Thierry Foucault']","['Asset price informativeness', 'Big data', 'FinTech', 'Information processing', 'Markets for information']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301806,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,2,Jérôme Dugast,2018,169.802853643638
The Volcker Rule and corporate bond market making in times of stress,"Focusing on downgrades as stress events that drive the selling of corporate bonds, we show that the illiquidity of stressed bonds has increased after the Volcker Rule. Dealers regulated by the rule have curtailed their market-making activities and non-Volcker-affected dealers have not offset the decreased activities of Volcker-affected dealers. Furthermore, even Volcker-affected dealers that are not constrained by Basel III and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review regulations change their behavior, inconsistent with the effects being driven by these other regulations. Because Volcker-affected dealers have been the main liquidity providers, bonds have become less liquid during times of stress due to the Volcker Rule.","['Jack Bao', 'Maureen O’Hara', 'Xing (Alex) Zhou']","['Volcker Rule', 'Corporate bond illiquidity', 'Regulation', 'Capital commitment', 'Dealer inventory', 'Market making']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301491,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,1,Jack Bao,2018,169.802853643638
Corporate debt maturity profiles,"We study a novel aspect of a firm’s capital structure, namely, the profile of its debt maturity dates. In a simple theoretical framework we show that the dispersion of debt maturities constitutes an important dimension of capital structure choice, driven by firm characteristics and debt rollover risk. Guided by these predictions we establish two main empirical results. First, using an exogenous shock to rollover risk, we document a significant increase in maturity dispersion for firms that need to roll over maturing debt. Second, we find strong support that maturities of newly issued debt are influenced by pre-existing maturity profiles.","['Jaewon Choi', 'Dirk Hackbarth', 'Josef Zechner']","['Capital structure', 'Debt structure', 'Debt maturity']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301855,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,3,Jaewon Choi,2018,169.802853643638
Resaleable debt and systemic risk,"Many debt claims, such as bonds, are resaleable; others, such as repos, are not. There was a fivefold increase in repo borrowing before the 2008–2009 financial crisis. Why? Did banks’ dependence on non-resaleable debt precipitate the crisis? In this paper, we develop a model of bank lending with credit frictions. The key feature of the model is that debt claims are heterogenous in their resaleability. We find that decreasing credit market frictions leads to an increase in borrowing via non-resaleable debt. Such borrowing has a dark side: It causes credit chains to form, because, if a bank makes a loan via non-resaleable debt and needs liquidity, it cannot sell the loan but must borrow via a new contract. These credit chains are a source of systemic risk, as one bank’s default harms not only its creditors but also its creditors’ creditors. Overall, our model suggests that reducing credit market frictions may have an adverse effect on the financial system and even lead to the failures of financial institutions.","['Jason Roderick Donaldson', 'Eva Micheler']","['Resaleable debt', 'Systemic risk', 'Bankruptcy', 'Repos', 'Securities law']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303161,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,3,Jason Roderick Donaldson,2018,169.802853643638
Warehouse banking,"We develop a theory of banking that explains why banks started out as commodities warehouses. We show that warehouses become banks because their superior storage technology allows them to enforce the repayment of loans most effectively. Further, interbank markets emerge endogenously to support this enforcement mechanism. Even though warehouses store deposits of real goods, they make loans by writing new fake warehouse receipts, rather than by taking deposits out of storage. Our theory helps to explain how modern banks create funding liquidity and why they combine warehousing (custody and deposit-taking), lending, and private money creation within the same institutions. It also casts light on a number of contemporary regulatory policies.","['Jason Roderick Donaldson', 'Giorgia Piacentino', 'Anjan Thakor']","['Banking', 'Private money', 'Financial history']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301107,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,129,2,Jason Roderick Donaldson,2018,169.802853643638
Do an insider's wealth and income matter in the decision to engage in insider trading?,"We explore why insiders engage in informed trading, given the surprisingly small average insider returns reported in the literature and the potential costs involved. We begin by proposing a model of an insider's decision to engage in insider trading. We then empirically test the model's predictions using archival data of corporate insiders in Sweden. Consistent with the model, we find that less wealthy insiders are more likely to time their insider selling, and to sell in greater magnitudes, prior to abnormal price declines than wealthy insiders. We also find that less wealthy insiders with lower risk aversion as measured by their criminal behavior are particularly prone to timing their selling to avoid price declines.","['Jenni Kallunki', 'Juha-Pekka Kallunki', 'Henrik Nilsson', 'Mikko Puhakka']","['Insider trading', 'Wealth, Income']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301533,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,1,Jenni Kallunki,2018,169.802853643638
Absolving beta of volatility’s effects,"The beta anomaly, negative (positive) alpha on stocks with high (low) beta, arises from beta’s positive correlation with idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL). The relation between IVOL and alpha is positive among underpriced stocks but negative and stronger among overpriced stocks (Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan, 2015). That stronger negative relation combines with the positive IVOL-beta correlation to produce the beta anomaly. The anomaly is significant only within overpriced stocks and only in periods when the beta-IVOL correlation and the likelihood of overpricing are simultaneously high. Either controlling for IVOL or simply excluding overpriced stocks with high IVOL renders the beta anomaly insignificant.","['Jianan Liu', 'Robert F.

Using a data set of more than 14.5 million customer product reviews on Amazon.com from 2004 through 2015, I find evidence that consumer opinions contain information for stock pricing. A spread portfolio that is long on stocks with high abnormal customer ratings and short on stocks with low abnormal customer ratings delivers an abnormal return of around 55.7 to 73.0 basis points per month. There is no evidence of return reversals in the subsequent year. The return predictability of customer ratings continues to hold after controlling for firm characteristics such as gross profitability, advertising, research and development expenses, and trading volume. Furthermore, abnormal customer ratings positively predict revenues and earnings surprises.

We find that on average HFTs provide liquidity during EPMs by absorbing imbalances created by non-high frequency traders (nHFTs). Yet HFT liquidity provision is limited to EPMs in single stocks. When several stocks experience simultaneous EPMs, HFT liquidity demand dominates their supply.

However, the maturity of startups that apply for funding (and are ultimately funded) inversely correlates with the entrepreneurship-friendliness of the country.

These results are particularly evident when institutions have multiple blockholdings in the same industry, when they have activism experience, or when they have long-term blockholdings in their portfolio firms.

Are overconfident CEOs better leaders? Evidence from stakeholder commitments,"We find evidence that the leadership of overconfident chief executive officers (CEOs) induces stakeholders to take actions that contribute to the leader's vision. By being intentionally overexposed to the idiosyncratic risk of their firms, overconfident CEOs exhibit a strong belief in their firms’ prospects.

Human capital relatedness and mergers and acquisitions,"We construct a measure of the pairwise relatedness of firms’ human capital to examine whether human capital relatedness is a key factor in mergers and acquisitions. We find that mergers are more likely and merger returns and postmerger performance are higher when firms have related human capital. These relations are stronger or only present in acquisitions where the merging firms do not operate in the same industries or product markets. Reductions in employment and wages following mergers with high human capital relatedness suggest that the merged firm has greater ability to layoff low quality and/or duplicate employees and reduce labor costs. We further show in a falsification test that human capital relatedness has no effect on acquiring firm returns in asset sales when little or no labor is transferred, which helps validate our measure of human capital relatedness.","['Kyeong Hun Lee', 'David C.

Market intraday momentum,"Based on high frequency S & P 500 exchange-traded fund (ETF) data from 1993–2013, we show an intraday momentum pattern: the first half-hour return on the market as measured from the previous day’s market close predicts the last half-hour return. This predictability, which is both statistically and economically significant, is stronger on more volatile days, on higher volume days, on recession days, and on major macroeconomic news release days. Intraday momentum also exists for ten other most actively traded domestic and international ETFs. Theoretically, the intraday momentum is consistent not only with Bogousslavsky’s (2016) model of infrequent portfolio rebalancing but also with a model of late-informed trading near the market close.","['Lei Gao', 'Yufeng Han', 'Sophia Zhengzi Li', 'Guofu Zhou']","['High frequency trading', 'Overnight return', 'Intraday', 'Predictability', 'Momentum']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301351,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,129,2,Lei Gao,2018,169.802853643638
Financing investment spikes in the years surrounding World War I⁎,"In the period surrounding World War I, US firms sharply increased investment in fixed assets and working capital to accommodate large increases in demand associated with the war. Concurrently, the US adopted an excess profits tax, which created a tax bias in favor of equity financing. Despite this tax bias, firms in need of external funds largely issued debt, not equity, to finance investment spikes when the excess profits tax was in effect. Further, we find these firms systematically reduced debt after the war, whereas other firms did not. The results support models that link the dynamics of firms’ financing decisions with the dynamics of their investment opportunities and are inconsistent with models that emphasize taxes as a primary determinant of financing decisions.","['Leonce Bargeron', 'David Denis', 'Kenneth Lehn']","['Capital structure', 'Financing flexibility', 'Investment spikes', 'Corporate taxes']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1830179X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,2,Leonce Bargeron,2018,169.802853643638

Fees vary significantly across GPs and are persistent within GPs, even after accounting for fee rebates to limited partners (LPs).

Time varying risk aversion,"Exploiting portfolio data and repeated surveys of an Italian bank's clients, we test whether investors’ risk aversion increases following the 2008 crisis. We find that, after the crisis, both qualitative and quantitative measures of risk aversion increase substantially and that affected individuals divest more stock. We investigate four explanations: changes in wealth, expected income, perceived probabilities, and emotion-based changes of the utility function. Our data are inconsistent with the first two channels, while they suggest that fear is a potential mechanism underlying financial decisions, whether by increasing the curvature of the utility function or the salience of negative outcomes.","['Luigi Guiso', 'Paola Sapienza', 'Luigi Zingales']",[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300461,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,3,Luigi Guiso,2018,169.802853643638
"Tradability of output, business cycles and asset prices","I examine the effect of a firm’s tradability, the proportion of output that is exported abroad, on its stock returns over business cycles from 1947–2015. Firms with higher tradability have more cyclical asset returns, even after controlling for the real exchange rate. Returns of a portfolio long on firms with the highest tradability and short on firms with the lowest tradability can predict changes in the real dollar exchange rate and trade volumes.

The (dis)advantages of clearinghouses before the Fed,"Operating in individual cities, US clearinghouses were the closest thing to a central bank before 1914, but they only assisted banks that chose to join the association. Using an annual bank-level database for seven states between 1880 and 1910, this paper shows that after the entry of a clearinghouse member banks were less likely and nonmember banks in the same city were more likely to close. The results are driven by the fact that the presence of clearinghouses led all banks to become more exposed to systemic liquidity risk, yet provided liquidity only to member banks during panics.",['Matthew Jaremski'],"['Bank regulation', 'Financial panics', 'Regulatory arbitrage', 'Clearinghouses', 'Interbank networks', 'Bank failure', 'National Banking Era']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300023,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,3,Matthew Jaremski,2018,169.802853643638
Tax distortions and bond issue pricing,"Original issue premium (OIP) bonds are the norm in the US tax-exempt market but very rare in the taxable market. A tax subsidy helps explain this disparity. Unlike bonds issued at par or discount, the price of OIP bonds can fall and yet remain above par, providing secondary market buyers with more tax-exempt coupon and less taxable market discount gain. The subsidy for OIP bonds explains additional, previously undocumented empirical facts.

The execution quality of corporate bonds,"This paper investigates execution quality issues in corporate bond trading. Using an extensive sample of bond trades by insurance companies, we find that an insurance company entering a trade of similar size and on the same side for the same bond on the same day with the same dealer will receive a better price if the insurance company is a more active trader than if it is a less active trader. Trading with the dominant dealer or underwriter worsens these differentials, while greater transparency and smaller trading networks lessens these effects.

Asset pricing and ambiguity: Empirical evidence⁎,"We introduce ambiguity in conjunction with risk to study the relation between risk, ambiguity, and expected returns. Distinguishing between ambiguity and attitudes toward ambiguity, we develop an empirical methodology for measuring the degree of ambiguity and for assessing attitudes toward ambiguity from market data. The main findings indicate that ambiguity in the equity market is priced. Introducing ambiguity alongside risk provides stronger evidence on the role of risk in explaining expected returns in the equity markets. The findings also indicate that investors’ level of aversion to or love for ambiguity is contingent on the expected probability of favorable returns.","['Menachem Brenner', 'Yehuda Izhakian']","['Ambiguity aversion', 'Ambiguity measurement', 'Knightian uncertainty', 'Equity premium']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301831,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,3,Menachem Brenner,2018,169.802853643638
Cost of experimentation and the evolution of venture capital,"We study how technological shocks to the cost of starting new businesses have led the venture capital model to adapt in fundamental ways over the prior decade. We both document and provide a framework to understand the changes in the investment strategy of venture capitalists (VCs) in recent years – an increased prevalence of a “spray and pray” investment approach – where investors provide a little funding and limited governance to an increased number of startups that they are more likely to abandon, but where initial experiments significantly inform beliefs about the future potential of the venture. This adaptation and related entry by new financial intermediaries has led to a disproportionate rise in innovations where information on future prospects is revealed quickly and cheaply, and reduced the relative share of innovation in complex technologies where initial experiments cost more and reveal less.","['Michael Ewens', 'Ramana Nanda', 'Matthew Rhodes-Kropf']","['Innovation', 'Venture capital', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Investing', 'Abandonment options']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300631,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,3,Michael Ewens,2018,169.802853643638
Cash flow duration and the term structure of equity returns,"The term structure of equity returns is downward-sloping: stocks with high cash flow duration earn 1.10% per month lower returns than short-duration stocks in the cross-section. I create a measure of cash flow duration at the firm level using balance sheet data to show this novel fact. Factor models can explain only 50% of the return differential, and the difference in returns is three times larger after periods of high investor sentiment. Analysts extrapolate from past earnings growth into the future and predict high returns for high-duration stocks following high-sentiment periods, contrary to ex-post realizations. I use institutional ownership as a proxy for short-sale constraints, and find the negative cross-sectional relationship between cash flow duration and returns is only contained within short-sale constrained stocks.",['Michael Weber'],"['Dividend strips', 'Short-sale constraints', 'Anomalies', 'Sentiment']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300667,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,3,Michael Weber,2018,169.802853643638

How does the stock market absorb shocks?,"Using a comprehensive set of news stories, we find a stark difference in market responses to positive and negative price shocks accompanied by new information. When there is a news story about a firm, positive price shocks are followed by reversal, while negative ones result in drift. This is interpreted as the stock market overreaction to good news and underreaction to bad news. These seemingly contradictory results can be explained in a single framework, considering the interaction of retail investors with attention bias, and arbitrageurs with short-run capital constraints. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that both patterns are stronger when the attention bias is stronger, and when the arbitrage capital is scarce.","['Murray Z.

Extrapolation and bubbles,"We present an extrapolative model of bubbles. In the model, many investors form their demand for a risky asset by weighing two signals—an average of the asset’s past price changes and the asset’s degree of overvaluation—and “waver” over time in the relative weight they put on them. The model predicts that good news about fundamentals can trigger large price bubbles, that bubbles will be accompanied by high trading volume, and that volume increases with past asset returns.

Spillovers from good-news and other bankruptcies: Real effects and price responses,"We model debt restructurings that could endogenously end in bankruptcy, and study spillovers to competitors’ operating decisions, profits, restructuring outcomes and security prices. We show that while bankruptcy could cause the firm’s share price to drop, bankruptcy always signals good news about the firm. We identify the conditions under which a bankruptcy also signals good news about competitors. We demonstrate that when a firm’s bankruptcy costs are relatively small, bankruptcy raises its share price while lowering the prices of competitors’ shares and debt as well as boosting the probability that they will enter bankruptcy. When there is little information asymmetry about the firm’s prospects, or the information asymmetry is about industry prospects, bankruptcy raises competitors’ share and debt prices and lowers their probability of bankruptcy.","['Nina Baranchuk', 'Michael J.

Leverage constraints and asset prices: Insights from mutual fund risk taking,"Prior theory suggests that time variation in the degree to which leverage constraints bind affects the pricing kernel. We propose a measure for this leverage constraint tightness by inverting the argument that constrained investors tilt their portfolios to riskier assets. We show that the average market beta of actively managed mutual funds—intermediaries facing leverage restrictions—captures their desire for leverage and thus the tightness of constraints. Consistent with theory, it strongly predicts returns of the betting-against-beta portfolio, and is a priced risk factor in the cross-section of mutual funds and stocks. Funds with low exposure to the factor outperform high-exposure funds by 5% annually, and for stocks this difference reaches 7%. Our results show that the tightness of leverage constraints has important implications for asset prices.","['Oliver Boguth', 'Mikhail Simutin']","['Leverage constraints', 'Asset prices', 'Betting-against-beta', 'Mutual fund performance', 'Cross-section of stock returns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303124,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,2,Oliver Boguth,2018,169.802853643638
Disagreement about inflation and the yield curve,"We show that inflation disagreement, not just expected inflation, has an impact on nominal interest rates. In contrast to expected inflation, which mainly affects the wedge between real and nominal yields, inflation disagreement affects nominal yields predominantly through its impact on the real side of the economy. We show theoretically and empirically that inflation disagreement raises real and nominal yields and their volatilities. Inflation disagreement is positively related to consumers’ cross-sectional consumption growth volatility and trading in fixed income securities. Calibrating our model to disagreement, inflation, and yields reproduces the economically significant impact of inflation disagreement on yield curves.","['Paul Ehling', 'Michael Gallmeyer', 'Christian Heyerdahl-Larsen', 'Philipp Illeditsch']","['Inflation disagreement', 'Real and nominal yields', 'Yield volatilities', 'Cross-sectional consumption growth volatility', 'Speculative trade']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300011,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,3,Paul Ehling,2018,169.802853643638
Does improved information improve incentives?,"This paper studies the value of more precise signals on agent performance in an optimal contracting model with endogenous effort. With limited liability, the agent’s wage is increasing in output only if output exceeds a threshold, else it is zero regardless of output. If the threshold is sufficiently high, the agent only beats it, and is rewarded for increasing output through greater effort, if there is a high noise realization. Thus, a fall in output volatility reduces effort incentives—information and effort are substitutes—offsetting the standard effect that improved information lowers the cost of compensation. We derive conditions relating the incentive effect to the underlying parameters of the agency problem.","['Pierre Chaigneau', 'Alex Edmans', 'Daniel Gottlieb']","['Executive compensation', 'Limited liability', 'Options', 'Risk management', 'Relative performance evaluation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301260,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,2,Pierre Chaigneau,2018,169.802853643638
Carry,"We apply the concept of carry, which has been studied almost exclusively in currency markets, to any asset.

Carry predicts returns cross-sectionally and in time series for a host of different asset classes, including global equities, global bonds, commodities, US Treasuries, credit, and options. Carry is not explained by known predictors of returns from these asset classes, and it captures many of these predictors, providing a unifying framework for return predictability. We reject a generalized version of Uncovered Interest Parity and the Expectations Hypothesis in favor of models with varying risk premia, in which carry strategies are commonly exposed to global recession, liquidity, and volatility risks, though none fully explains carry’s premium.","['Ralph S.J.

Non-rating revenue and conflicts of interest,"Rating agencies produce ratings used by investors, but obtain most of their revenue from issuers, leading to a conflict of interest. We employ a unique data set on the use of non-rating services, and the associated payments, in India, to test if this conflict affects ratings quality. Agencies rate issuers that pay them for non-rating services higher (than agencies not hired for such services). Such issuers also have higher default rates. Both effects are increasing in the amount paid. These results suggest that issuers which hire agencies for non-rating services receive higher ratings despite having higher default risk.

While FOFs focusing on buyouts outperform public markets, they underperform direct fund investment strategies in buyout.

Busy directors and firm performance: Evidence from mergers,"This paper studies whether director appointments to multiple boards impact firm outcomes. To overcome endogeneity of board appointments, I exploit variation generated by mergers that terminate entire boards and thus shock the appointments of those terminated directors. Reductions of board appointments are associated with higher profitability, market-to-book, and likelihood of directors joining board committees. The performance gains are particularly stark when directors are geographically far from firm headquarters.

The amount of clustering that cannot be explained by contagion and firms’ exposure to observable and latent systematic factors is insignificant.

These effects are economically large and persist over time even after implementation of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) in 2009.

Protection of trade secrets and capital structure decisions,"Firms strategically choose more conservative capital structures when they face greater competitive threats stemming from the potential loss of their trade secrets to rivals.

The effect is stronger for firms with a greater risk of losing key employees to rivals, for those facing financially stronger rivals, and for those in industries where competition is more intense.","['Sandy Klasa', 'Hernán Ortiz-Molina', 'Matthew Serfling', 'Shweta Srinivasan']","['Capital structure', 'Trade secrets', 'Intellectual property', 'Competitive threats']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300473,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,2,Sandy Klasa,2018,169.802853643638
"Interest rate volatility, the yield curve, and the macroeconomy","This paper provides theory and evidence that a low-dimensional term structure model can simultaneously price bonds and related options. It shows that a component of volatility risk largely unrelated to the shape of the yield curve is a determinant of expected excess returns for holding long maturity bonds. It also finds evidence for this return relationship both in the model and directly in the data through regression analysis. The paper also identifies a link between corporate earnings performance and interest rate volatility, providing a channel driving interest rate volatility. The structure of risk in the model that gives rise to these features of volatility is distinct from that inherent in recent models with unspanned stochastic volatility.","['Scott Joslin', 'Yaniv Konchitchki']","['Macro-finance term structure model', 'Interest rate volatility', 'No-arbitrage model', 'Macroeconomy']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303148,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,2,Scott Joslin,2018,169.802853643638
Non-myopic betas,"An overlapping generations model with investors having heterogeneous investment horizons leads to a two-factor asset pricing model. The risk premiums are determined by the exposure to the market (myopic betas) and the future return on the efficient portfolio (non-myopic betas), which is identified nonparametrically from equilibrium. Non-myopic betas are priced in the cross-section of stocks, producing increasing and economically significant risk-return relation. In the model with funding constraints, low non-myopic beta stocks deliver higher risk-adjusted returns. Empirically, a betting against non-myopic beta portfolio generates superior performance relative to common factor models and is negatively correlated with the market betting against beta portfolio.","['Semyon Malamud', 'Grigory Vilkov']","['Asset prices', 'Beta', 'CAPM', 'Hedging', 'Strategic asset allocation']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301284,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,129,2,Semyon Malamud,2018,169.802853643638
The option to quit: The effect of employee stock options on turnover,"We show that in the years following a large broad-based employee stock option (BBSO) grant, employee turnover falls at the granting firm. We find evidence consistent with a causal relation by exploiting unexpected changes in the value of unvested options. A large fraction of the reduction in turnover appears to be temporary with turnover increasing in the third year following the year of the adoption of the BBSO plan. The increase three years post-grant is equal in magnitude to the cumulative decrease in turnover over the three prior years, suggesting that long-vesting BBSO plans delay, instead of prevent, turnover.","['Serdar Aldatmaz', 'Paige Ouimet', 'Edward D Van Wesep']","['Employee stock options', 'Turnover']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730257X,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,1,Serdar Aldatmaz,2018,169.802853643638
The unintended consequences of divestment,"A divestment campaign aims to depress share prices to induce managers to change firm behavior. Assuming that managers make profit-maximizing decisions in the absence of a campaign, firms that accede to divestors’ demands raise short-run share prices but depress long-run profits. Managers who are more interested in short-run prices are therefore more motivated by divestment than managers who care about long-run profits. We show that, as most managerial compensation contracts reward long-run profitability and stock returns, divestment can be ineffective at best, and perhaps counterproductive, rewarding managers who attract divestment campaigns. In a quantification exercise, we show that the wealth of most executives running likely divestment targets in 2015 would be unaffected by even large movements in share prices. Of those affected, a substantial majority would benefit from divestment.","['Shaun William Davies', 'Edward Dickersin Van Wesep']","['Divestment', 'Exclusionary investment', 'Socially responsible investment', 'Executive compensation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300783,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,3,Shaun William Davies,2018,169.802853643638

Capital gains lock-in and governance choices,"Differences in accrued gains and investors’ tax-sensitivity induce variation in a capital gains lock-in effect across mutual funds even for the same stock at the same time.

Consistent with tax motivation, these findings are concentrated among funds with tax-sensitive investors. Further, high aggregate capital gains across funds holding a stock predict a higher likelihood management loses a vote and a lower likelihood a contentious vote is proposed.","['Stephen G.

Loan prospecting and the loss of soft information,"We study a controlled experiment in which a bank's loan officers were incentivized based on originated loan volume to encourage prospecting for new business. While treated loan officers did attract new applications, both extensive and intensive margins of loan origination expanded (+ 31% new loans; loan size + 15%). We find that loan officers gave greater weight to hard information in approval decisions. Despite no change in the observable characteristics of approved loans, their default rate increased (+ 24%). Finally, the bank's imputed credit default model lost its predictive power.

We exemplify this mechanism’s empirical relevance using quarterly earnings announcements, which cluster across months along size and book-to-market. Seventy percent of the alpha reduction from including SMB and HML occurs in the four main earnings announcement months. The information structure factor accounts for all of SMB and HML’s seasonal alpha reduction and one third of their overall alpha reduction.

PTH's relations with future profitability and future investment growth are both significantly positive, and they mirror PTH's relation with future returns in the cross section and by time horizons. Incorporating the information about future investment growth contained in price level variables (e.g., PTH) helps the q factors to capture better those anomalies rooted in future investment growth.

When arm's length is too far: Relationship banking over the credit cycle,"We conduct face-to-face interviews with bank chief executive officers to classify 397 banks across 21 countries as relationship or transaction lenders. We then use the geographic coordinates of these banks’ branches and of 14,100 businesses to analyze how the lending techniques of banks near firms are related to credit constraints at two contrasting points of the credit cycle. We find that while relationship lending is not associated with credit constraints during a credit boom, it alleviates such constraints during a downturn. This positive role of relationship lending is stronger for small and opaque firms and in regions with a more severe economic downturn. Moreover, relationship lending mitigates the impact of a downturn on firm growth and does not constitute evergreening of loans.","['Thorsten Beck', 'Hans Degryse', 'Ralph De Haas', 'Neeltje van Horen']","['Relationship banking', 'Credit constraints', 'Credit cycle']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302957,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,1,Thorsten Beck,2018,169.802853643638
Securitization bubbles: Structured finance with disagreement about default risk,"An additional reason for the structured finance boom of the 2000s may have been disagreement about default risk of collateral assets. When risk-neutral investors disagree about average default probabilities, structuring collateral cash flow raises prices by concentrating optimists’ demand on risky tranches. With disagreement about default correlation, low-correlation investors believe in diversification and pay high prices for senior tranches they deem riskless. High-correlation investors value junior tranches they expect to pay whenever aggregate conditions are good. Risk aversion and short selling through credit default swaps reduce the prices of both pass-through and structured securitizations but may increase the return to tranching.",['Tobias Broer'],"['Structured finance', 'CDO', 'RMBS', 'Disagreement', 'Default correlation', 'Credit risk', 'Great recession', 'Housing bubble']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303112,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,127,3,Tobias Broer,2018,169.802853643638
Asset pricing with beliefs-dependent risk aversion and learning,"This paper studies equilibrium in a pure exchange economy with unobservable Markov switching growth regimes and beliefs-dependent risk aversion (BDRA). Risk aversion is stochastic and depends nonlinearly on consumption and beliefs. Equilibrium is obtained in closed form. The market price of risk, the interest rate, and the stock return volatility acquire new components tied to fluctuations in beliefs. A three-regime specification is estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM). Model moments match their empirical counterparts for a variety of unconditional moments, including the equity premium, stock returns volatility, and the correlations between stock returns and consumption and dividends. Dynamic features of the data, such as the countercyclical behaviors of the equity premium and volatility, are also captured. Model volatility provides a good fit for realized volatility. A new factor, the information risk premium, is found to be a strong predictor of future excess returns. These results are obtained with an estimated risk aversion fluctuating between 1.44 and 1.93.","['Tony Berrada', 'Jérôme Detemple', 'Marcel Rindisbacher']","['Asset pricing puzzles', 'Beliefs-dependent risk aversion', 'Equity premium', 'Risk-free rate', 'Volatility']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300643,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,3,Tony Berrada,2018,169.802853643638
Alpha or beta in the eye of the beholder: What drives hedge fund flows?,"Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) alpha explains hedge fund flows better than alphas from more sophisticated models. This suggests that investors pool together sophisticated model alpha with returns from exposures to traditional (except for the market) and exotic risks. We decompose performance into traditional and exotic risk components and find that while investors chase both components, they place greater relative emphasis on returns associated with exotic risk exposures that can only be obtained through hedge funds. However, we find little evidence of persistence in performance from traditional or exotic risks, which cautions against investors’ practice of seeking out risk exposures following periods of recent success.","['Vikas Agarwal', 'T.

Financing as a supply chain: The capital structure of banks and borrowers,"We develop a model of the joint capital structure decisions of banks and their borrowers. Bank leverage of 85% or higher emerges because bank seniority both dramatically reduces bank asset volatility and incentivizes risk-taking by producing a skewed return distribution. Nonfinancial firms choose low leverage to protect their banks, presenting a partial resolution to the low-leverage puzzle. Our setup naturally extends to include government actions as we model bank assets using a modified Basel framework. Deposit insurance and bailout expectations lead banks and borrowers to take on more risk. Capital regulation lowers bank leverage but can increase bank risk due to a compensating increase in borrower leverage. Despite this, doubling current capital requirements reduces bank default risk by up to 90%, with only a small increase in loan interest rates.","['Will Gornall', 'Ilya A.

Our generalized q model informs us to use corporate credit-risk information to predict investments when empirical measurement issues of Tobin’s average q are significant (e.g., equity is much more likely to be mis-priced than debt), as in Philippon (2009). We find, consistent with our theory, that credit spreads and bond q have significant predictive powers on micro-level and aggregate investments corroborating the recent empirical work of Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012). We also show that the quantitative effects of the stochastic interest rates and capital illiquidity on investment, Tobin’s average q, the duration and user cost of capital, and the value of growth opportunities are substantial.

Evidence from a callable options market,"We examine the notion that financial products which cater to investors’ behavioral biases can yield high trading activity and thus be profitable for issuers. Our setting considers options with a callback feature, namely, callable bull/bear contracts (CBBCs). Such contracts have high skewness when close to callback and thus appeal to cumulative prospect theory preferences. CBBCs with high skewness earn negative average returns, and issuers’ gross profits vary positively with CBBC skewness. Over the 2009–2014 period, issuers earn gross profits of about $1.67 billion by trading CBBCs on the Hang Seng Index.

Banks and investment funds respond in a procyclical manner to past security-specific holding period returns. In contrast, insurance companies and pension funds act countercyclically; they buy when returns have been negative and sell after high returns. The heterogeneous responses can be explained by differences in their balance sheet structure.

These measures contain statistically and economically significant predictive signals for stock market returns and real economic activity. We decompose illiquidity proxies into a component capturing aggregate volatility and a residual. The predictive content of these components differs in important ways.

One fundamental and two taxes: When does a Tobin tax reduce financial price volatility?,"We aim to make two contributions to the literature on the effects of transaction costs on financial price volatility. First, by augmenting a double differencing approach with a research design with three ingredients (a common set of companies simultaneously listed on two stock exchanges, binding capital controls, and different timing of changes in transaction costs), we obtain a control group that has identical corporate fundamentals as the treatment group. We apply the research design to Chinese stocks that are cross-listed in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Second, we allow transaction costs to have different effects in markets with different maturity. We find a significantly negative relationship, on average, between stamp duty increase and price volatility. However, this average effect masks some important heterogeneity. In particular, when institutional investors have become a significant part of the traders’ pool, we find an opposite effect. Overall, our results suggest that a Tobin tax could work in an immature market, but can backfire in a more developed market.","['Yongheng Deng', 'Xin Liu', 'Shang-Jin Wei']","['Tobin tax', 'Transaction cost', 'Volatility', 'Speculation', 'Limits to arbitrage']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301089,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,130,3,Yongheng Deng,2018,169.802853643638
Quantitative easing auctions of Treasury bonds,"The Federal Reserve uses (reverse) auctions to implement its purchases of Treasury bonds in quantitative easing (QE). To evaluate dealers’ offers across multiple bonds, the Fed relies on its internal yield curve model, fitted to secondary market bond prices. From November 2010 to September 2011, a one standard deviation increase in the cheapness of a Treasury bond (how much the market price of the bond is below a model-implied value) increases the Fed’s purchase quantity of that bond by 276 million and increases the auction costs on that bond by 2.6 cents per $100 par value, controlling for standard covariates. Our results suggest that the Fed harvests gains from trades by purchasing undervalued bonds, but strategic dealers extract some profits because the Fed’s relative values can be partly inferred from price data.","['Zhaogang Song', 'Haoxiang Zhu']","['Quantitative easing', 'Auction', 'Treasury bond', 'Federal Reserve']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300436,Journal of Financial Economics,1.07503504023974,128,1,Zhaogang Song,2018,169.802853643638

International tests of a five-factor asset pricing model,"Average stock returns for North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific increase with the book-to-market ratio (B/M) and profitability and are negatively related to investment. For Japan, the relation between average returns and B/M is strong, but average returns show little relation to profitability or investment. A five-factor model that adds profitability and investment factors to the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993) largely absorbs the patterns in average returns. As in Fama and French, 2015, Fama and French, 2016, the model's prime problem is failure to capture fully the low average returns of small stocks whose returns behave like those of low profitability firms that invest aggressively.","['Eugene F.

The price of variance risk,"Between 1996 and 2014, it was costless on average to hedge news about future variance at horizons ranging from 1 quarter to 14 years. Only unexpected, transitory realized variance was significantly priced. These results present a challenge to many structural models of the variance risk premium, such as the intertemporal CAPM and recent models with Epstein–Zin preferences and long-run risks. The results are also difficult to reconcile with macro models in which volatility affects investment decisions.

"Capital utilization, market power, and the pricing of investment shocks","Capital utilization and market power crucially affect asset prices in an economy exposed to shocks that improve real investment opportunities through capital-embodied technological innovations. We embed these two mechanisms in a standard general equilibrium model and show that (i) the price of risk for investment shocks is negative under fixed capital utilization, but positive under sufficiently flexible capital utilization, and (ii) the equity return exposure to investment shocks is negative under perfect competition, but positive under high market power. We further show that, high market power, persistent components in technology growth, and a strong preference for early resolution of uncertainty are jointly important to quantitatively match the observed equity risk premium.","['Lorenzo Garlappi', 'Zhongzhi Song']","['Investment shocks', 'Capital utilization', 'Market power', 'Risk premium']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302313,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,3,Lorenzo Garlappi,2017,169.7187095139831

Are corporate inversions good for shareholders?,"Corporate inversion, the process of redomiciling for tax purposes, reduces corporate income taxes, but it imposes a personal tax cost that is shareholder-specific. We develop a model, incorporating the corporate tax benefits and personal tax costs, to quantify the return to inversion for different shareholders. Foreign and tax-exempt investors, along with the chief executive officer, disproportionately benefit. We show that an inversion simultaneously reduces the wealth of many taxable shareholders. The model illustrates an agency conflict in which heterogeneity in personal taxes generates a wealth transfer between shareholders.

Why do loans contain covenants? Evidence from lending relationships,"Despite the importance of banks’ role as delegated monitors, little is known about how non-price terms of loan contracts are structured to optimize information production in a lending relationship. Using a large sample of corporate loans, this paper examines the effect of relationship lending on covenant choice. Consistent with information asymmetry theories, covenant tightness is relaxed over the duration of a relationship, especially for opaque borrowers. In contrast, the effect of lending relationship intensity on the number of covenants included in a loan follows an inverted U shape. I discuss potential explanations for this finding.",['Robert Prilmeier'],"['Relationships', 'Banking', 'Covenants', 'Information asymmetries', 'Monitoring incentives']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302379,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,3,Robert Prilmeier,2017,169.7187095139831
The bright side of financial derivatives: Options trading and firm innovation,"Do financial derivatives enhance or impede innovation? We answer this question by examining the relationship between equity options markets and standard measures of firm innovation. We find that firms with more options trading activity generate more patents and patent citations per dollar invested in research and development (R&D), after accounting for other confounding factors. These results are confirmed when we use a propensity score matching procedure and an instrumental variable approach to control for the potential endogeneity of options trading. The evidence is consistent with the notion that the enhanced informational efficiency induced by options leads to an improved allocation of corporate resources. We further discuss possible underlying economic mechanisms through which more active options markets boost innovation and show that the effect remains substantial even after controlling for these mechanisms. Considering the average increase in the dollar volume of options traded for our sample firms, we conclude that a 200% move in options volume increases firm innovation by about 31%.","['Iván Blanco', 'David Wehrheim']","['Innovation', 'R&D productivity', 'Options market', 'Price informativeness', 'Career concerns']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300739,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,1,Iván Blanco,2017,169.7187095139831

We find enormous cross-individual variation, ranging from zero to more than 75%, and strong cohort effects, with younger cohorts investing more internationally than older ones and each cohort investing more internationally over time. Access to financial advice, lower fees, and more international fund choices are associated with higher international allocations, suggesting a role for plan design and policy.

Early peek advantage? Efficient price discovery with tiered information disclosure,"From 2007 to June 2013, a small group of fee-paying, high-speed traders receive the Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment two seconds before its broader release. Within this early peek window, we find highly concentrated trading and a fast price discovery of less than 200 milliseconds. Outside this narrow window, general investors trade at fully adjusted prices. We further establish a causal relationship between the early peek mechanism and the fast price discovery by isolating the impact of the early peek arrangement along two dimensions. In cross section, we use other news releases without the early peek (as controls); in time series, we use the sudden suspension of the early peek arrangement in July 2013 (as the treatment). Our difference-in-difference tests directly connect the early peek arrangement to more efficient price discovery — it results in faster price discovery, lower volatility, and faster resolution of uncertainty. These results show that contrary to the common perception, tiered information release may help to reduce, rather than enhance, the informational advantage of faster traders and improve the efficiency of the price discovery process in financial markets.","['Grace Xing Hu', 'Jun Pan', 'Jiang Wang']","['Early peek', 'Information disclosure', 'Price discovery', 'High frequency trading']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730154X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,2,Grace Xing Hu,2017,169.7187095139831
Interim fund performance and fundraising in private equity,"General partners (GPs) in private equity (PE) report the performance of an existing fund while raising capital for a follow-on fund. Interim performance has large effects on fundraising outcomes. The impact is greatest when backed by exits and for low reputation GPs. Faced with these incentives, GPs time their fundraising to coincide with periods of peak performance through two strategies: (1) exit and fundraise and (2) net asset value (NAV) management. Consistent with the former, performance peaks are greatest for funds with high realization rates. Consistent with the latter, low reputation GPs with low realization rates experience performance peaks and erosions in performance after fundraising.","['Brad M.

Investment declines 5% before all elections and up to 15% for subsamples of firms particularly susceptible to political uncertainty. I use term limits as an instrumental variable (IV) for election closeness. Because close elections are related to economic downturns, I find that the effect of close elections on investment is understated by more than half by ordinary least squares (OLS).

However, public firms in internal finance dependent industries do not have a better innovation profile than private firms. The results are robust to various empirical strategies that address selection bias.

Systematic mistakes in the mortgage market and lack of financial sophistication,"Institutions often offer a menu of contracts to consumers in an attempt to create a separating equilibrium that reveals borrower types and provides better pricing. We test the effectiveness of a specific set of contracts in the mortgage market: mortgage points. Points allow borrowers to exchange an upfront amount for a decrease in the mortgage rate. We document that, on average, points takers lose about $700. Also, points takers are less financially savvy (less educated, older), and they make mistakes on other dimensions (e.g., inefficiently refinancing their mortgages).

Consistent with the labor channel behind these effects, deals with greater potential for workforce restructuring show a greater reduction in volume, number, and synergies. Increases in employment protection impede layoffs, resulting in wage costs that match the magnitude of synergy losses.

We estimate the distressed sale discount to be about 8% while controlling for liquidity and for industry, or about double the 4% estimated for equity sales by distressed mutual funds. The discount becomes 13–14% if the stake sold is more than 5% of the firm or is sold as a block.

However, the citation increase comes mainly from incremental patents in the middle of the citation distribution; the numbers of uncited and highly cited patents—arguably associated with riskier innovation strategies—do not change significantly.","['Benjamin Balsmeier', 'Lee Fleming', 'Gustavo Manso']","['Corporate governance', 'Board composition', 'Innovation', 'Exploration and exploitation']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302355,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,3,Benjamin Balsmeier,2017,169.7187095139831

However, banks shield their core markets because most of the decline comes from loans in areas where banks do not own branches. Moreover, banks increase sales of more-liquid loans and they bid up the rate on deposits in the connected markets.

Limited disclosure and hidden orders in asset markets,Opacity assumes at least two prominent forms in asset markets. Dark exchanges and over-the-counter markets enable expert investors to hide their orders while originators carefully control the disclosure of fundamental information about the assets they source. We describe a simple model in which both forms of opacity – hidden orders and limited disclosure – complement one another. Costly investor expertise gives originators incentives to deliver assets of good quality. Keeping expert orders hidden generates the rents investors need to justify investing in expertise in the first place. Limiting disclosure mitigates the resulting adverse selection issues. Originators prefer to restrict the information they can convey to experts because it encourages the participation of non experts. This optimal organization of asset markets can be decentralized using standard financial arrangements.,"['Cyril Monnet', 'Erwan Quintin']","['Market design', 'Opacity', 'Asymmetric information']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302392,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,3,Cyril Monnet,2017,169.7187095139831

Reputation and signaling in asset sales,"Static adverse selection models of security issuance show that informed issuers can perfectly reveal their private information by maintaining a costly stake in the securities they issue. This paper shows that allowing an issuer to both signal current security quality via retention and build a reputation for honesty leads that issuer to misreport quality even when owning a positive stake, that is, the equilibrium is neither separating nor pooling. An issuer retains less as reputation improves and prices are more sensitive to retention when the issuer has a worse reputation.",['Barney Hartman-Glaser'],"['Costly signaling', 'Reputation', 'Repeated games', 'Asset-backed securities']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301009,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,2,Barney Hartman-Glaser,2017,169.7187095139831
Informed trading and price discovery before corporate events,"Stock prices incorporate less news before negative events than positive events. Further, informed agents use less price aggressive (limit) orders before negative events and more price aggressive (market) orders before positive events (buy–sell asymmetry). Motivated by these patterns, we model the execution risk that informed agents impose on each other and relate the asymmetry to costly short selling. When investor base is narrow, security borrowing is difficult, or the magnitude of the event is small, buy–sell asymmetry is pronounced and price discovery before negative events is lower. Overall, we show that the strategies of informed traders influence the process of price formation in financial markets, as predicted by theory.","['Shmuel Baruch', 'Marios Panayides', 'Kumar Venkataraman']","['Informed trader', 'Insider trading', 'Limit order', 'Short selling', 'Buy–sell asymmetry']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300995,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,3,Shmuel Baruch,2017,169.7187095139831
Banking integration and house price co-movement,"The correlation in house price growth across US states increased steadily between 1976 and 2000. This paper shows that the contemporaneous geographic integration of the US banking market, via the emergence of large banks, was a primary driver of this phenomenon. To this end, we first theoretically derive an appropriate measure of banking integration across state pairs and show that house price growth correlation is strongly related to this measure of financial integration. Our instrumental variable estimates suggest that banking integration can explain up to one-fourth of the rise in house price correlation over this period.","['Augustin Landier', 'David Sraer', 'David Thesmar']","['Financial integration', 'Co-movement', 'House prices']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300375,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,1,Augustin Landier,2017,169.7187095139831
Growth through rigidity: An explanation for the rise in CEO pay,"The dramatic rise in CEO compensation during the 1990s and early 2000s is a longstanding puzzle. In this paper, we show that much of the rise can be explained by a tendency of firms to grant the same number of options each year. Number-rigidity implies that the grant-date value of option awards will grow with firm equity returns, which were very high on average during the tech boom. Further, other forms of CEO compensation did not adjust to offset the dramatic growth in the value of option pay. Number-rigidity in options can also explain the increased dispersion in pay, the difference in growth between the US and other countries, and the increased correlation between pay and firm-specific equity returns. We present evidence that number-rigidity arose from a lack of sophistication about option valuation that is akin to money illusion. We show that regulatory changes requiring transparent expensing of the grant-date value of options led to a decline in number-rigidity and helps explain why executive pay increased less with equity returns during the housing boom in the mid-2000s.","['Kelly Shue', 'Richard R.

Maximum likelihood estimation of the equity premium,"The equity premium — the expected return on the aggregate stock market less the government bill rate – is of central importance to the portfolio allocation of individuals, to the investment decisions of firms, and to model calibration and testing. This quantity is usually estimated from the sample average excess return. We propose an alternative estimator, based on maximum likelihood, that takes into account information contained in dividends and prices. Applied to the postwar sample, our method leads to an economically significant reduction from 6.4% to 5.1%.

Socioeconomic status and learning from financial information,"The majority of lower socioeconomic status (SES) households in the U.S. and Europe do not have stock investments, which is detrimental to wealth accumulation. Here, we examine one explanation for this puzzling fact, namely, that economic adversity may influence how people learn from financial information. Using experimental and survey data from the U.S. and Romania, we find that lower SES individuals form more pessimistic beliefs about the distribution of stock returns and are less likely to invest in stocks when these investments are likely to have good outcomes. SES-related differences in pessimism may help explain variation in investments across households.","['Camelia M. Kuhnen', 'Andrei C.

Intangible capital and the investment-q relation,"The neoclassical theory of investment has mainly been tested with physical investment, but we show that it also helps explain intangible investment. At the firm level, Tobin’s q explains physical and intangible investment roughly equally well, and it explains total investment even better. Compared with physical capital, intangible capital adjusts more slowly to changes in investment opportunities. The classic q theory performs better in firms and years with more intangible capital: Total and even physical investment are better explained by Tobin’s q and are less sensitive to cash flow. At the macro level, Tobin’s q explains intangible investment many times better than physical investment. We propose a simple, new Tobin’s q proxy that accounts for intangible capital, and we show that it is a superior proxy for both physical and intangible investment opportunities.","['Ryan H.

How persistent is private equity performance? Evidence from deal-level data,"The persistence of returns is a critical issue for investors in their choice of private equity managers. In this paper, we analyse buyout performance persistence in new ways, using a unique database containing cash flow data on 13,523 portfolio company investments by 865 buyout funds. We focus on unique realized deals and find that persistence of fund managers has substantially declined as the private equity sector has matured and become more competitive. Private equity has, therefore, largely conformed to the pattern found in most other asset classes in which past performance is a poor predictor of the future.","['Reiner Braun', 'Tim Jenkinson', 'Ingo Stoff']","['Private equity', 'Returns', 'Performance persistence', 'Portfolio companies']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301775,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,2,Reiner Braun,2017,169.7187095139831
Efficiency and stability of a financial architecture with too-interconnected-to-fail institutions,"The regulation of large interconnected financial institutions has become a key policy issue. To improve financial stability, regulators have proposed limiting banks’ size and interconnectedness. I estimate a network-based model of the over-the-counter interbank lending market in the US and quantify the efficiency-stability implications of this policy. Trading efficiency decreases with limits on interconnectedness because the intermediation chains become longer. While restricting the interconnectedness of banks improves stability, the effect is non-monotonic.

Interbank networks in the National Banking Era: Their purpose and their role in the Panic of 1893,"The unit banking structure of the United States produced a uniquely important interbank correspondent network. During the National Banking Era, this network normally provided banks with access to money markets, facilitated payment processing, and helped banks meet legal reserve requirements. In crises, network connections could be a source of liquidity risk. That risk became evident during the Panic of 1893, when New York suspended convertibility.

Large shareholders and credit ratings,"This paper addresses regulatory concerns that large shareholders of credit rating agencies can influence the rating process. Unlike Standard & Poor's, which is a privately held division of McGraw-Hill, Moody's is a public company listed on the NYSE. From 2001 to 2010, Moody's has two shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway and Davis Selected Advisors, which collectively own about 23.5% of Moody's. Moody's ratings on bonds issued by important investee firms of these two stable large shareholders are more favorable relative to S&P, as well as Fitch, ratings. We exploit Moody's initial public offering in 2000 to address endogeneity and to mitigate concerns that the results are driven by issuer characteristics or by the greater informativeness of Moody's ratings. S&P's parent, McGraw-Hill, has a large shareholder for much less time, and some weak evidence exists that S&P ratings are relatively more favorable toward the owners of McGraw-Hill. These findings are consistent with regulatory concerns about the ownership and governance of rating agencies, especially those that are publicly listed.","['Simi Kedia', 'Shivaram Rajgopal', 'Xing\u2009(Alex) Zhou']","[""Moody's"", 'Credit rating agencies', 'Ownership structure', 'Conflict of interest', 'Difference-in-differences', 'Corporate bond', 'CMBS']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300442,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,124,3,Simi Kedia,2017,169.7187095139831

Using a comprehensive sample of publicly listed firms in 30 countries over the period 2001–2010, we find instead that greater foreign institutional ownership fosters long-term investment in tangible, intangible, and human capital. Foreign institutional ownership also leads to significant increases in innovation output. We identify these effects by exploiting the exogenous variation in foreign institutional ownership that follows the addition of a stock to the MSCI indexes.

Leverage and strategic preemption: Lessons from entry plans and incumbent investments,"This paper empirically investigates the effect of leverage on strategic preemption. Using new data on entry plans and incumbent investments from the American casino industry, I find that high leverage prevents incumbents from responding to entry threats. Facing the same set of entry plans, low-leverage incumbents expand physical capacity (by 30%), whereas high-leverage incumbents do not. This difference in investment matters because capacity installations preempt eventual entry. Stock market reactions to withdrawn plans imply that effective preemption increases incumbent firm value by 5%.

Of the two mechanisms, the informational efficiency channel has higher explanatory power than the corporate governance channel.","['Jonathan Brogaard', 'Dan Li', 'Ying Xia']","['Stock liquidity', 'Bankruptcy risk', 'EDF', 'Price efficiency', 'Governance']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300405,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,124,3,Jonathan Brogaard,2017,169.7187095139831

Investor flows and fragility in corporate bond funds,"This paper explores flow patterns in corporate bond mutual funds. We show that corporate bond funds exhibit a concave flow-to-performance relationship: their outflows are sensitive to bad performance more than their inflows are sensitive to good performance. Moreover, corporate bond funds tend to have greater sensitivity of outflows to bad performance when they have more illiquid assets and when the overall market illiquidity is high. These results point to the possibility of fragility in the fast-growing corporate bond market. The illiquidity of corporate bonds may generate a first-mover advantage among investors in corporate bond funds, amplifying their response to bad performance.","['Itay Goldstein', 'Hao Jiang', 'David T.

We find that VOV exposure is a significant determinant of hedge fund returns. After controlling for fund characteristics, we find a robust and significant negative risk premium for VOV exposure in the cross section of hedge fund returns. We corroborate our results using statistical and parameterized proxies of VOV over a longer sample period.","['Vikas Agarwal', 'Y. Eser Arisoy', 'Narayan Y.

Systemically important dealers exploit their connections at the expense of peripheral dealers as well as clients, charging higher markups than to other core dealers. Also, intermediation chains lengthened by 20% following the collapse of a flagship dealer in 2008 and even more for institutions strongly connected to this dealer. Finally, dealers drastically reduced their inventory during the crisis.","['Marco Di Maggio', 'Amir Kermani', 'Zhaogang Song']","['Corporate bond', 'Dealer network', 'Intermediation chain', 'Over-the-counter financial market', 'Trading relationship']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730003X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,124,2,Marco Di Maggio,2017,169.7187095139831
Debt correlations in the wake of the financial crisis: What are appropriate default correlations for structured products?,"This paper proposes several frameworks to estimate the appropriate default correlations for structured products, each of which jointly considers the role of co-movements in modeled risk characteristics and unmodeled systematic risk, or ‘frailty.’ We contrast our estimates with credit rating agencies’ default correlation assumptions, which were only 0.01 for Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) pre-crisis and have increased to 0.03 post-crisis. In contrast, the joint consideration of observable risk factors and frailty leads to substantially higher estimates of 0.12. We show that this translates into CLOs with credit risk understated by 26%, suggesting caution for the post-crisis structured finance market.","['Jordan Nickerson', 'John M.

"Staggered boards and long-term firm value, revisited","This paper revisits the staggered board debate focusing on the long-term association of firm value with changes in board structure. We find no evidence that staggered board changes are negatively related to firm value. However, we find a positive relation for firms engaged in innovation and where stakeholder relationships matter more. This suggests that staggered boards promote value creation for some firms by committing the firm to undertaking long-term projects and bonding it to the relationship-specific investments of its stakeholders. Our results are robust to matching procedures and an exogenous change in Massachusetts corporate law that mandated staggered boards.","['K.J. Martijn Cremers', 'Lubomir P. Litov', 'Simone M.

The source of information in prices and investment-price sensitivity,"This paper shows that real decisions depend not only on the total amount of information in prices, but the source of this information—a manager learns from prices when they contain information not possessed by him. We use the staggered enforcement of insider trading laws across 27 countries as a shock to the source of information that leaves total information unchanged: enforcement reduces (increases) managers’ (outsiders’) contribution to the stock price. Consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model, enforcement increases investment-q sensitivity, even when controlling for total price informativeness. The effect is larger in industries where learning is likely to be stronger, and in emerging countries where outsider information acquisition rises most post-enforcement. Enforcement does not increase the sensitivity of investment to cash flow, a non-price measure of investment opportunities. These findings suggest that extant measures of price efficiency should be rethought when evaluating real efficiency. More broadly, our paper provides causal evidence that managers learn from prices, by using a shock to price informativeness.","['Alex Edmans', 'Sudarshan Jayaraman', 'Jan Schneemeier']","['Financial efficiency', 'Real efficiency', 'Real effects of financial markets', 'Insider trading']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301344,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,1,Alex Edmans,2017,169.7187095139831
Advising shareholders in takeovers,"This paper studies the advisory role of the board of directors in takeovers. I develop a model in which the takeover premium and the ability of the target board to resist the takeover are endogenous. The analysis relates the influence of the board on target shareholders and the reaction of the market to its recommendations to various characteristics of the acquirer and the target. I also show that the expected target shareholder value can decrease with the expertise of the board and it is maximized when the board is biased against the takeover. Generally, uninformative and ignored recommendations are not necessarily evidence that the target board has no influence on the outcome of the takeover. Perhaps surprisingly, under the optimal board structure, target shareholders ignore the recommendations of the board, which are never informative in equilibrium.",['Doron Levit'],"['Board of directors', 'Communication', 'Corporate governance', 'Free-riding', 'Takeover']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302520,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,3,Doron Levit,2017,169.7187095139831
Reference-dependent preferences and the risk–return trade-off,"This paper studies the cross-sectional risk–return trade-off in the stock market. A fundamental principle in finance is the positive relation between risk and expected return. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the opposite. Using several intuitive risk measures, we show that the negative risk–return relation is much more pronounced among firms in which investors face prior losses, but the risk–return relation is positive among firms in which investors face prior gains. We consider a number of possible explanations for this new empirical finding and conclude that reference-dependent preference is the most promising explanation.","['Huijun Wang', 'Jinghua Yan', 'Jianfeng Yu']","['Prospect theory', 'Risk–return trade-off', 'Risk', 'Uncertainty', 'Capital gains overhang']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301787,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,2,Huijun Wang,2017,169.7187095139831
Do takeover laws matter? Evidence from five decades of hostile takeovers,"This study evaluates the relation between hostile takeovers and 17 takeover laws from 1965 to 2014. Using a data set of largely exogenous legal changes, we find that certain takeover laws, such as poison pill and business combination laws, have no discernible impact on hostile activity, while others such as fair price laws have reduced hostile takeovers. We construct a Takeover Index from the laws and find that higher takeover protection is associated with lower firm value, consistent with entrenchment and agency costs. However, conditional on a bid, firms with more protection achieve higher premiums, consistent with increased bargaining power.","['Matthew D. Cain', 'Stephen B.

The effects of credit default swap trading on information asymmetry in syndicated loans,"This study shows that initiation of credit default swap (CDS) trading for an entity's debt increases the share of loans retained by loan syndicate lead arrangers and increases loan spread. These findings are consistent with CDS initiation reducing the effectiveness of a lead arranger's stake in the loan to serve as a mechanism to address the adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the loan syndicate. Additional findings corroborate this interpretation by revealing a moderating effect for firms with greater transparency, for loans originated by a lead arranger with a strong reputation in this market, and for firms with relatively illiquid CDS markets.","['Dan Amiram', 'William H.

U.S. multinationals and cash holdings,"U.S. multinational firms hold significantly more cash than domestic firms. I study this cash differential using a dynamic model featuring corporate physical and intangible investment, cross-border decisions, and financial policies. I find that the cash differential diminishes by 42% if repatriation costs are set to zero. Hence, costly repatriation induces cash accumulation offshore. Further, firms that invest overseas have different ex ante cash policies from firms that do not. I examine this self-selection effect by eliminating heterogeneous intangibility across multinational and domestic firms, which reduces the cash differential by 28%. I also examine the likelihood of corporate inversion under federal regulations. The estimated annual tax loss to the U.S. Treasury from inversions is reduced from $2.2 billion to $1.3 billion if the requirements for foreign ownership are tightened from 20% to 50%.",['Tiantian Gu'],"['Cash holdings', 'Multinationals', 'Intangibles', 'Structural estimation']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300983,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,2,Tiantian Gu,2017,169.7187095139831
Compensation goals and firm performance,"Using a large data set of performance goals employed in executive incentive contracts, we find that a disproportionately large number of firms exceed their goals by a small margin as compared to the number that fall short of the goal by a similar margin. This asymmetry is particularly acute for earnings goals, when compensation is contingent on a single goal, when the pay-performance relationship around the goal is concave-shaped, and for grants with non-equity-based payouts. Firms that exceed their compensation target by a small margin are more likely to beat the target the next period and CEOs of firms that miss their targets are more likely to experience a forced turnover.

Portfolio concentration and performance of institutional investors worldwide,"Using data on security holdings for 10,771 institutional investors from 72 countries, we test whether concentrated investment strategies result in excess risk-adjusted returns. We examine several measures of portfolio concentration with respect to countries and industries and find that portfolio concentration is directly related to risk-adjusted returns for institutional investors worldwide. Results suggest, in contrast to traditional asset pricing theory and in support of information advantage theory, that concentrated investment strategies in international markets can be optimal.","['Nicole Choi', 'Mark Fedenia', 'Hilla Skiba', 'Tatyana Sokolyk']","['International investments', 'Institutional investors', 'Information advantage', 'Home bias', 'Diversification', 'Industry concentration']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301581,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,1,Nicole Choi,2017,169.7187095139831
The impact of innovation: Evidence from corporate bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs),"Using distinct features of corporate bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), I find that financial innovation has a significant and long-term positive valuation impact on the systemically important underlying securities. A one standard deviation increase in ETF ownership reduces high-yield and investment-grade bond spreads by 20.3 and 9.2 basis points, respectively, implying an average monthly price increase of 1.03% and 0.75%. Two novel quasi-natural experiments exploit exogenous changes in ETF eligibility to confirm the effect. Examining theoretical explanations for the effect, I find that ETFs decrease liquidity trader participation, increase institutional ownership, and insignificantly or negatively impact the liquidity of individual bonds.",['Caitlin D.

Information Shocks and Short-Term Market Underreaction,"Using jumps in stock prices as a proxy for large information shocks, we provide evidence consistent with short-term underreaction in the US equity market. Strategies long (short) stocks with positive (negative) lagged jump returns earn significantly positive returns over the next one- to three-month horizons. The results based on intraday jumps, especially overnight jumps, provide further evidence consistent with underreaction. The underreaction is robust to controlling for other firm characteristics, extends stock return momentum over intermediate to short horizons, and captures market underreaction to information shocks beyond earnings surprises. We further show that limited investor attention contributes to short-term underreaction.","['George J. Jiang', 'Kevin X.

The advantages of using excess returns to model the term structure,"We advocate the use of excess returns rather than yields or log prices in analysing the risk neutral dynamics of the term structure. We show that under standard assumptions, excess returns are affine in the risk neutral innovations in the factors. This framework has several important advantages. First, it allows for an easy estimation of models that are more flexible than the AR(1). Indeed, we estimate models with more general dynamics, like ARFIMA(p, d, q), almost as easily as AR(1). Second, within our framework the dimension of the unrestricted model is the same for the AR(1) as it is for the richer models, and does not expand in line with the state vector as it does in a yield or log price framework. This makes it appropriate to test all of these risk neutral dynamic specifications against the same OLS unrestricted alternative. Our results for the US Treasury bond market show that the unrestricted model is preferred to the AR(1) by the Bayesian Information Criterion, but the opposite conclusion is reached for more flexible models. A final advantage of the excess returns framework is that the pricing errors are much lower than for the equivalent log price system.","['Adam Goliński', 'Peter Spencer']","['Term structure', 'Excess return framework', 'Long memory']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300922,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,1,Adam Goliński,2017,169.7187095139831
"Debt enforcement, investment, and risk taking across countries","We argue that the prospect of an imperfect enforcement of debt contracts in default reduces shareholder–debtholder conflicts and induces leveraged firms to invest more and take on less risk as they approach financial distress. To test these predictions, we use a large panel of firms in 41 countries with heterogeneous debt enforcement characteristics. Consistent with our model, we find that the relation between debt enforcement and firms’ investment and risk depends on the firm-specific probability of default. A differences-in-differences analysis of firms’ investment and risk taking in response to bankruptcy reforms that make debt more renegotiable confirms the cross-country evidence.","['Giovanni Favara', 'Erwan Morellec', 'Enrique Schroth', 'Philip Valta']","['Debt enforcement', 'Default', 'Investment', 'Asset sales', 'Risk-taking']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301532,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,1,Giovanni Favara,2017,169.7187095139831
Shades of darkness: A pecking order of trading venues,"We characterize the dynamic fragmentation of U.S. equity markets using a unique data set that disaggregates dark transactions by venue types. The “pecking order” hypothesis of trading venues states that investors “sort” various venue types, putting low-cost-low-immediacy venues on top and high-cost-high-immediacy venues at the bottom. Hence, midpoint dark pools on top, non-midpoint dark pools in the middle, and lit markets at the bottom. As predicted, following VIX shocks, macroeconomic news, and firms’ earnings surprises, changes in venue market shares become progressively more positive (or less negative) down the pecking order. We further document heterogeneity across dark venue types and stock size groups.","['Albert J.

Moral hazard in active asset management,"We consider a model of active asset management in which mutual fund managers exert unobservable effort to earn excess returns. Investors allocate capital to actively managed funds and passively managed products. In equilibrium, investors are indifferent between investing an additional dollar with an active manager or with a passively managed product. As passively managed products become more attractive to investors, active managers’ revenues from portfolio-management services fall, reducing their effort incentives. More-severe decreasing-returns-to-scale are also associated with reduced incentives and increased moral hazard. Performance-based fees and holdings-based data are all unlikely to mitigate moral hazard.","['David C.

News implied volatility and disaster concerns,"We construct a text-based measure of uncertainty starting in 1890 using front-page articles of the Wall Street Journal. News implied volatility (NVIX) peaks during stock market crashes, times of policy-related uncertainty, world wars, and financial crises. In US postwar data, periods when NVIX is high are followed by periods of above average stock returns, even after controlling for contemporaneous and forward-looking measures of stock market volatility. News coverage related to wars and government policy explains most of the time variation in risk premia our measure identifies. Over the longer 1890–2009 sample that includes the Great Depression and two world wars, high NVIX predicts high future returns in normal times and rises just before transitions into economic disasters. The evidence is consistent with recent theories emphasizing time variation in rare disaster risk as a source of aggregate asset prices fluctuations.","['Asaf Manela', 'Alan Moreira']","['Text-based analysis', 'Implied volatility', 'Rare disasters', 'Equity premium', 'Return predictability', 'Machine learning']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301751,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,1,Asaf Manela,2017,169.7187095139831
How collateral laws shape lending and sectoral activity,"We demonstrate the central importance of creditors’ ability to use movable assets as collateral (as distinct from immovable real estate) when borrowing from banks. Using a unique cross-country micro-level loan data set containing loan-to-value ratios for different assets, we find that loan-to-values of loans collateralized with movable assets are lower in countries with weak collateral laws, relative to immovable assets, and that lending is biased toward the use of immovable assets. Using sector-level data, we find that weak movable collateral laws create distortions in the allocation of resources that favor immovable-based production and investment. An analysis of Slovakia's collateral law reform confirms our findings.","['Charles W.

Bank rescues and bailout expectations: The erosion of market discipline during the financial crisis,"We design a novel test for changes in market discipline based on the relation between firm-specific risk, credit spreads, and equity returns. We use our method to analyze the evolution of bailout expectations during the recent financial crisis. We find that bailout expectations peaked in reaction to government interventions following the failure of Lehman Brothers, and returned to pre-crisis levels following the initiation of the Dodd-Frank Act. We do not find such changes in market discipline for nonfinancial firms. Finally, market discipline is weaker for government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and systemically important banks (SIBs) than for investment banks.","['Florian Hett', 'Alexander Schmidt']","['Bailout', 'Implicit guarantees', 'Too-big-to-fail', 'Market discipline', 'Hedge ratio']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302532,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,3,Florian Hett,2017,169.7187095139831
"Bank capital, liquid reserves, and insolvency risk","We develop a dynamic model of banking to assess the effects of liquidity and leverage requirements on banks’ financing decisions and insolvency risk. In this model, banks face taxation, issuance costs of securities, and default costs and maximize shareholder value by choosing their debt-to-asset ratio, deposits-to-debt ratio, liquid asset holdings, equity issuance and default policies in response to these frictions as well as regulatory requirements. Our analytic characterization of the bank policy choices shows that imposing liquidity requirements leads to lower bank losses in default at the cost of an increased likelihood of default. Combining liquidity and leverage requirements reduces both the likelihood of default and the magnitude of bank losses in default.","['Julien Hugonnier', 'Erwan Morellec']","['Banks', 'Liquidity buffers', 'Capital structure', 'Insolvency risk', 'Regulation']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300971,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,2,Julien Hugonnier,2017,169.7187095139831
Idiosyncratic risk and the manager,"We develop a model to characterize and quantify the effects of stock, option, and fixed compensation on a manager’s risk-taking incentive and investment choice. We find the average chief executive officer’s (CEO) compensation contract incentivizes overinvestment by 1.3 percentage points per year, with significant variation across firms and over time. We estimate a value of CEO effort implied by compensation contracts and find it to be strongly related to firm intangibility. Finally, we assess the effects on investment of FAS 123R and a hypothetical ban on option grants and find heterogeneous responses that depend on firm volatility and the prior structure of compensation.","['Brent Glover', 'Oliver Levine']","['Corporate investment', 'Executive compensation', 'Managerial incentives', 'Agency conflicts', 'Risk taking']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301502,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,2,Brent Glover,2017,169.7187095139831
"Employee bargaining power, inter-firm competition, and equity-based compensation","We develop a model to illustrate that equity-based compensation for non-executive employees and product market decisions are related. When the product market is competitive and employees have low bargaining power, the unique equilibrium is for each firm’s owners to offer equity-based compensation to their employees. In this setting, equity-based compensation leads to a lower wage rate, which makes each firm more competitive with its rival. However, this unique equilibrium is a Prisoner’s Dilemma for the firms’ original owners. Our results are consistent with several empirical regularities and provide predictions on when firms will offer equity-based compensation to their employees.","['Francesco Bova', 'Liyan Yang']","['Employee bargaining power', 'Market competition', 'Equity compensation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301538,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,2,Francesco Bova,2017,169.7187095139831
Tail risk in hedge funds: A unique view from portfolio holdings,"We develop a new systematic tail risk measure for equity-oriented hedge funds to examine the impact of tail risk on fund performance and to identify the sources of tail risk. We find that tail risk affects the cross-sectional variation in fund returns and that investments in both tail-sensitive stocks and options drive tail risk. Moreover, leverage and exposure to funding liquidity shocks are important determinants of tail risk. We find evidence of some funds being able to time tail risk exposure prior to the 2008–2009 financial crisis.","['Vikas Agarwal', 'Stefan Ruenzi', 'Florian Weigert']","['Hedge funds', 'Tail risk', 'Portfolio holdings', 'Funding liquidity risk', 'Leverage']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730123X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,3,Vikas Agarwal,2017,169.7187095139831

We analytically derive testable implications for the effects of product market characteristics on firm size, CEO pay, and CEO impact on firm value. CEO talent matters more in more competitive markets with greater product substitutabilities. Our CEO impact estimates are much higher than those obtained by previous structural approaches that abstract away from CEO market segmentation. The estimates differ across industries primarily due to variation in product market competition, rather than variation in the CEO talent distribution.","['Hae\xa0Won\xa0(Henny) Jung', 'Ajay Subramanian']","['CEO talent', 'CEO pay', 'Product market competition', 'Structural estimation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300740,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,1,Hae\xa0Won\xa0(Henny) Jung,2017,169.7187095139831
What do measures of real-time corporate sales say about earnings surprises and post-announcement returns?,"We develop real-time proxies of retail corporate sales from multiple sources, including ∼50 million mobile devices. These measures contain information from both the earnings quarter (“within quarter”) and the period between the quarter-end and the earnings announcement date (“post quarter”). Our within-quarter measure is powerful in explaining quarterly sales growth, revenue surprises, and earnings surprises, generating average excess announcement returns of 3.4%. However, our post-quarter measure is related negatively to announcement returns and positively to post-announcement returns. When post-quarter private information is positive, managers, at announcement, provide pessimistic guidance and use negative language. This effect is more pronounced when, post-announcement, management insiders trade. We conclude that managers do not fully disclose their private information and instead bias their disclosures down when in possession of positive private information. The data suggest that they could be motivated in part by subsequent personal stock-trading opportunities.","['Kenneth Froot', 'Namho Kang', 'Gideon Ozik', 'Ronnie Sadka']","['Real-time corporate sales', 'Earnings announcement', 'Corporate disclosure', 'Insider trading']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300776,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,1,Kenneth Froot,2017,169.7187095139831
Do staggered boards harm shareholders?,"We examine the Cohen and Wang (2013) conclusion that a staggered board lowers firm value based on the stock price reaction to two 2010 Delaware court rulings in the Airgas, Inc. case. The first ruling weakened the potency of a staggered board and the second restored it. We find that the Cohen and Wang results, for their sample, become insignificant after excluding a few penny stocks, stocks with value below $10 million, or over-the-counter (non-exchange) stocks. The effects of the rulings are also insignificant for an alternative sample.","['Yakov Amihud', 'Stoyan Stoyanov']","['Staggered board', 'Classified board', 'Corporate governance', 'Antitakeover measures', 'Takeover defense', 'Airgas']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301994,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,2,Yakov Amihud,2017,169.7187095139831
High frequency trading and the 2008 short-sale ban,"We examine the effects of high-frequency traders (HFTs) on liquidity using the September 2008 short sale-ban. To disentangle the separate impacts of short selling by HFTs and non-HFTs, we use an instrumental variables approach exploiting differences in the ban's cross-sectional impact on HFTs and non-HFTs. Non-HFTs’ short selling improves liquidity, as measured by bid-ask spreads. HFTs’ short selling has the opposite effect by adversely selecting limit orders, which can decrease liquidity supplier competition and reduce trading by non-HFTs. The results highlight that some HFTs’ activities are harmful to liquidity during the extremely volatile short-sale ban period.","['Jonathan Brogaard', 'Terrence Hendershott', 'Ryan Riordan']","['High frequency trading', 'Short selling', 'Liquidity']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300211,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,124,1,Jonathan Brogaard,2017,169.7187095139831

Dealers with lower equity returns and greater leverage prior to borrowing from the facilities were more likely to participate in the programs, borrow more, and, in the case of the TSLF, at higher bidding rates. Dealers with less liquid collateral on their balance sheets before the facilities were introduced also tended to borrow more.

Board reforms and firm value: Worldwide evidence,"We examine the impact of corporate board reforms on firm value in 41 countries. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that board reforms increase firm value. Reforms involving board and audit committee independence, but not reforms involving separation of chairman and chief executive officer positions, drive the valuation increases. In addition, while comply-or-explain reforms result in a greater increase in firm value than rule-based reforms, the effects of reforms are similar across civil law and common law countries. Further investigation shows that the subsequent change in board independence plays an important role in explaining the effectiveness of the reforms.","['Larry Fauver', 'Mingyi Hung', 'Xi Li', 'Alvaro G.

In contrast, we find strong evidence of bias both before and after the settlement for affiliated analysts at non-sanctioned banks. Our results suggest that the settlement led to an increase in the expected costs of issuing biased coverage at sanctioned banks, while concurrent self-regulatory organization rule changes were largely ineffective at reducing the influence of investment banking on analyst research at large non-sanctioned banks.","['Shane A.

WSJ Category Kings – The impact of media attention on consumer and mutual fund investment decisions,"We exploit a novel natural experiment to establish a causal relation between media attention and consumer investment behavior, independent of the conveyed information. Our findings indicate a 31% local average increase in quarterly capital flows into mutual funds mentioned in a prominent Wall Street Journal “Category Kings” ranking list, compared to those funds which just missed making the list. This flow increase is about seven times larger than extra flows due to the well-documented performance-flow relation. Other funds in the same fund complex receive substantial extra flows as well, especially in smaller complexes. There is no increase in flows when the Wall Street Journal publishes similar lists absent the prominence of the Category Kings labeling. We show mutual fund managers react to the incentive created by the media effect in a strategic way predicted by theory, and present evidence for the existence of propagation mechanisms including increased fund complex advertising subsequent to having a Category King and increased efficacy of subsequent fund media mentions.","['Ron Kaniel', 'Robert Parham']","['Mutual funds', 'Investor attention', 'Incentives', 'Flows', 'Regression discontinuity']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302008,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,2,Ron Kaniel,2017,169.7187095139831
Do corporate taxes hinder innovation?,"We exploit staggered changes in state-level corporate tax rates to show that an increase in taxes reduces future innovation. A variety of tests, including those based on policy discontinuity at contiguous counties straddling borders of politically similar states, show that local economic conditions do not drive our results. The effect we document is consistent across the innovation spectrum: taxes affect not only patenting and R&D investment but also new product introductions, which we measure using textual analysis.

Difference-in-difference tests around brokerage house merger/closure events (which increase asymmetric information through reductions in analyst coverage) indicate worse industry-adjusted sales growth for shocked firms than for their peers. Our results are consistent with Bolton and Scharfstein's (1990) tradeoff between investor agency concerns and predation risk. Further support is found in stronger treatment effects among firms with ex ante greater agency concerns, financing constraints, asymmetric information, and those operating in ex ante more competitive (fluid) product market spaces.

"The term structure of credit spreads, firm fundamentals, and expected stock returns","We explore the link between credit and equity markets by considering the informational content of the term structure of credit spreads. A shallower credit term structure predicts decreases in default risk and increases in future profitability, as well as favorable earnings surprises. Further, the slope of the credit term structure negatively predicts future stock returns. While systematic slope risk is priced, information diffusion from the credit market to equities, particularly in less visible stocks, plays an additional role in accounting for return predictability from credit slopes. That is, such predictability is less evident in stocks with high institutional ownership, analyst coverage, and liquidity, and vice versa.","['Bing Han', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam', 'Yi Zhou']","['Cross section of stock return', 'Credit default spreads', 'Term structure', 'Information diffusion']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300028,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,124,1,Bing Han,2017,169.7187095139831

The effects of institutional investor objectives on firm valuation and governance,"We find that ownership by different types of institutional investors has varying implications for future firm misvaluation and governance characteristics. Dedicated institutional investors decrease future firm misvaluation, in both direction and magnitude, relative to fundamentals. In contrast, transient institutional investors have the opposite effect. Using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation FD as an exogenous shock to information dissemination, we find evidence consistent with dedicated institutions having an information advantage. Similarly, dedicated investors are associated with better future governance characteristics, while transient investors are not. The valuation effects are primarily driven by institutional portfolio concentration while the governance effects are driven by portfolio turnover. These results imply a more nuanced relationship between institutional ownership and firm value and corporate governance.","['Paul Borochin', 'Jie Yang']","['Institutional investors', 'Investor type', 'Dedicated', 'Transient', 'Misvaluation', 'Corporate governance', 'Blockholding', 'Portfolio turnover', 'Information dissemination', 'SEC Regulation FD']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301307,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,1,Paul Borochin,2017,169.7187095139831
Intermediary asset pricing: New evidence from many asset classes,"We find that shocks to the equity capital ratio of financial intermediaries—Primary Dealer counterparties of the New York Federal Reserve—possess significant explanatory power for cross-sectional variation in expected returns. This is true not only for commonly studied equity and government bond market portfolios, but also for other more sophisticated asset classes such as corporate and sovereign bonds, derivatives, commodities, and currencies. Our intermediary capital risk factor is strongly procyclical, implying countercyclical intermediary leverage. The price of risk for intermediary capital shocks is consistently positive and of similar magnitude when estimated separately for individual asset classes, suggesting that financial intermediaries are marginal investors in many markets and hence key to understanding asset prices.","['Zhiguo He', 'Bryan Kelly', 'Asaf Manela']","['Sophisticated asset classes', 'Primary dealers', 'Intermediary capital', 'Leverage cycles']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730212X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,1,Zhiguo He,2017,169.7187095139831
Changes in corporate effective tax rates over the past 25 years,"We investigate systematic changes in corporate effective tax rates over the past 25 years and find that effective tax rates have decreased significantly. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the decline in effective tax rates is not concentrated in multinational firms; effective tax rates have declined at approximately the same rate for both multinational and domestic firms. Moreover, within multinational firms, both foreign and domestic effective rates have decreased. Finally, changes in firm characteristics and declining foreign statutory tax rates explain little of the overall decrease in effective rates.","['Scott D. Dyreng', 'Michelle Hanlon', 'Edward L.

"Risk, ambiguity, and the exercise of employee stock options","We investigate the importance of ambiguity, or Knightian uncertainty, in executives’ stock option exercise decisions. We develop an empirical estimate of ambiguity and include it in regression models alongside the traditional measure of risk, equity volatility. We show that each variable has a significant effect on the timing of option exercises, with volatility causing executives to hold options longer to preserve option value, and ambiguity increasing the tendency for executives to exercise early.","['Yehuda Izhakian', 'David Yermack']","['Ambiguity measurement', 'Ambiguity aversion', 'Employee stock options']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302367,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,124,1,Yehuda Izhakian,2017,169.7187095139831
"Credit default swaps, exacting creditors and corporate liquidity management","We investigate the liquidity management of firms following the inception of credit default swaps (CDS) markets on their debt, which allow hedging and speculative trading on credit risk to be carried out by creditors and other parties. We find that reference firms hold more cash after CDS trading commences on their debt. The increase in cash holdings is more pronounced for CDS firms that do not pay dividends and have a higher marginal value of liquidity. For CDS firms with higher cash flow volatility, these increased cash holdings do not entail higher leverage. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that CDS-referenced firms adopt more conservative liquidity policies to avoid negotiations with more exacting creditors.","['Marti G.

Tax uncertainty and retirement savings diversification,"We investigate the optimal savings decisions for investors with access to pre-tax (traditional) and post-tax (Roth) versions of tax-advantaged retirement accounts. The model features a progressive tax schedule and uncertainty over future tax rates. Traditional accounts are valuable for hedging retirement account performance and managing current income near tax-bracket cutoffs, whereas Roth accounts allow investors to mitigate uncertainty over future tax schedules. The optimal asset location policy for most households involves diversifying between traditional and Roth vehicles. Contrary to conventional advice, the substantial economic benefits from Roth investments are not limited to investors with low current income.","['David C. Brown', 'Scott Cederburg', 'Michael S.

Is economic uncertainty priced in the cross-section of stock returns?,We investigate the role of economic uncertainty in the cross-sectional pricing of individual stocks and equity portfolios. We estimate stock exposure to an economic uncertainty index and show that stocks in the lowest uncertainty beta decile generate 6% more annualized risk-adjusted return compared to stocks in the highest uncertainty beta decile. We find that the uncertainty premium is driven by the outperformance (underperformance) by stocks with negative (positive) uncertainty beta. Our results indicate that uncertainty-averse investors demand extra compensation to hold stocks with negative uncertainty beta and they are willing to pay high prices for stocks with positive uncertainty beta.,"['Turan G.

Do exogenous changes in passive institutional ownership affect corporate governance and firm value?,"We investigate whether corporations and their executives react to an exogenous change in passive institutional ownership and alter their corporate governance structure. We find that exogenous increases in passive ownership lead to increases in CEO power and fewer new independent director appointments. Consistent with these changes not being beneficial for shareholders, we observe negative announcement returns to the appointments of new independent directors. We also show that firms carry out worse mergers and acquisitions after exogenous increases in passive ownership. These results suggest that the changed ownership structure causes higher agency costs.","['Cornelius Schmidt', 'Rüdiger Fahlenbrach']","['Corporate governance', 'Institutional ownership', 'Monitoring', 'Index reconstitutions']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300053,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,124,2,Cornelius Schmidt,2017,169.7187095139831
Customer–supplier relationships and corporate tax avoidance,"We investigate whether firms in close customer–supplier relationships are better able to identify and implement tax avoidance strategies via supply chains. Consistent with our prediction, we find that both principal customers and their dependent suppliers avoid more taxes than other firms. Further analysis suggests that principal customers and dependent suppliers likely engage in tax strategies involving shifting profits to tax haven subsidiaries. Moreover, tax benefits appear to explain both principal customer firms’ and dependent supplier firms’ organizational decisions. Overall, our study provides evidence of the importance of tax avoidance as a source of gains from these relationships.","['Ling Cen', 'Edward L.

"Precautionary savings, retirement planning and misperceptions of financial literacy","We measure financial literacy among LinkedIn members, complementing standard questions with additional questions that allow us to gauge self-perceptions of financial literacy. Average financial literacy is surprisingly low given the demographics of our sample: fewer than two-thirds of chief financial officers, chief executive officers, and chief operating officers complete the test correctly. Financial literacy, precautionary savings and retirement planning are positively correlated, but this is mostly driven by perceived, not actual, literacy: controlling for self-perceptions, actual literacy has low predictive power. Perceptions drive decision-making among low-literacy respondents and are associated with mistaken beliefs about financial products and less willingness to accept financial advice.","['Anders Anderson', 'Forest Baker', 'David T.

Debt maturity and the liquidity of secondary debt markets,"We model the debt maturity choice of firms in the presence of fixed issuance costs in the primary market and search frictions in the secondary market for debt. In the secondary market, short maturities improve the bargaining position of sellers, which reduces the required issuance yield. Long maturities reduce reissuance costs. The optimally chosen maturity trades off both considerations. Equilibrium exhibits inefficiently short maturity choices. An individual firm does not internalize that a longer maturity increases expected gains from trade in the secondary market, which attracts more buyers and, hence, facilitates the sale of debt issued by other firms.","['Max Bruche', 'Anatoli Segura']","['Debt maturity', 'Search', 'Liquidity']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300600,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,124,3,Max Bruche,2017,169.7187095139831
Explaining CEO retention in misreporting firms,"We propose a framework that advances our understanding of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) retention decisions in misreporting firms. Consistent with economic intuition, outside directors are more likely to fire (retain) CEOs when retention (replacement) costs are high relative to replacement (retention) costs. When the decision is ambiguous because neither cost dominates, outside directors are more likely to retain the CEO when they both benefit from selling stock in the misreporting period. We show that joint abnormal selling captures director–CEO alignment incrementally to biographical overlap. This new proxy operationalizes information sharing and trust, making it useful for studying economic decision-making embedded in social relationships.","['Messod D. Beneish', 'Cassandra D.

"Information percolation, momentum and reversal","We propose a joint theory of time-series momentum and reversal based on a rational-expectations model. We show that a necessary condition for momentum to arise in this framework is that information flows at an increasing rate. We focus on word-of-mouth communication as a mechanism that enforces this condition and generates short-term momentum and long-term reversal. Investors with heterogeneous trading strategies—contrarian and momentum traders—coexist in the marketplace. Although a significant proportion of investors are momentum traders, momentum is not completely eliminated. Word-of-mouth communication spreads rumors and generates price run-ups and reversals. Our theoretical predictions are in line with empirical findings.","['Daniel Andrei', 'Julien Cujean']","['Asset pricing', 'Momentum', 'Information percolation', 'Equilibrium']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302380,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,3,Daniel Andrei,2017,169.7187095139831
"Firm characteristics, consumption risk, and firm-level risk exposures","We propose a novel approach to measuring firm-level risk exposures and costs of equity. Using a simple consumption-based asset pricing model that explains nearly two-thirds of the variation in average returns across 55 anomaly portfolios, we map the relation between exposures to consumption risk and portfolio-level characteristics. We use this relation to calculate exposures to consumption risk at the firm level and show that the calculated consumption risk exposures yield portfolios with large differences in average returns and ex post consumption risk exposures consistent with those predicted by our calculated betas. Further, industry betas and risk premia implied by our procedure display economically intuitive variation over time. Finally, Fama-MacBeth regressions suggest that risk exposures calculated using our procedure dominate those from alternative factor models at explaining cross-sectional variation in returns.","['Robert F.

Endogenous intermediation in over-the-counter markets,"We provide a theory of trading through intermediaries in over-the-counter markets. The role of intermediaries is to sustain trade. In our model, traders are connected through an informational network. Agents observe their neighbors’ actions and can trade with their counterparty in a given period through a path of intermediaries in the network. Nevertheless, agents can renege on their obligations. We show that trading through an informational network is essential to support trade when agents infrequently meet the same counteparty. However, intermediaries must receive fees to implement trades. Concentrated intermediation, as represented by a star network, is both constrained efficient and stable when agents incur linking costs. The center agent in a star can receive higher fees as well.","['Ana Babus', 'Tai-Wei Hu']","['Over-the-counter trading', 'Strategic default', 'Dynamic network formation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300788,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,125,1,Ana Babus,2017,169.7187095139831
Variance risk premiums and the forward premium puzzle,"We provide new empirical evidence that world currency and U.S. stock variance risk premiums have nonredundant and significant predictive power for the appreciation rates of 22 with respect to the U.S. dollar, especially at the four-month and one-month horizons, respectively. The heterogeneous exposures of currencies to the currency variance risk premium are systematically rising along the line of inflation risk. We rationalize these findings in a consumption-based asset pricing model, with local consumption uncertainty and global inflation uncertainty characterized, respectively, by the stock and currency variance risk premiums.","['Juan M.

It pays to write well,"We quantify the effects of easy-to-read disclosure documents on firm value by analyzing shareholder reports of closed-end investment companies in which the company's value can be estimated separately from the value of the company's underlying assets. Using a copy-editing software application that counts the pervasiveness of the most important ‘writing faults’ that make a document harder to read, our analysis provides evidence that issuing financial disclosure documents with low readability causes firms to trade at significant discounts relative to the value of their fundamentals. Our estimates suggest that a one-standard-deviation decrease in readability decreases firm value by a full 2.5%.

Merger activity in industry equilibrium,"We quantify the impact of merger activity on productive efficiency. We develop and calibrate a dynamic industry-equilibrium model that features mergers, entry, and exit by heterogeneous firms. Mergers affect productivity directly through realized synergies, and indirectly through firms’ incentives to enter or exit the industry. Merger activity increases average firm productivity by 4.8%, of which 4.1% reflects the accumulation of synergies, and 0.7% the interaction between merger options and firms’ entry and exit decisions. We show that ignoring the implications of merger activity for public policies that promote entry can reverse the expected impact of these policies on productivity.","['Theodosios Dimopoulos', 'Stefano Sacchetto']","['Mergers', 'Entry', 'Exit', 'Industry equilibrium']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301319,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,1,Theodosios Dimopoulos,2017,169.7187095139831
Uncovering expected returns: Information in analyst coverage proxies,"We show that analyst coverage proxies contain information about expected returns. We decompose analyst coverage into abnormal and expected components using a simple characteristic-based model and show that firms with abnormally high analyst coverage subsequently outperform firms with abnormally low coverage by approximately 80 basis points per month. We also show abnormal coverage rises following exogenous shocks to underpricing and predicts improvements in firms’ fundamental performance, suggesting that return predictability stems from analysts more heavily covering underpriced stocks. Our findings highlight the usefulness of analysts’ actions in expected return estimations, and a potential inference problem when coverage proxies are used to study information asymmetry and dissemination.","['Charles M.C.

We suggest that CEOs are willing to trade off status and career benefits from working for a publicly admired company against additional monetary compensation. Our identification strategy is based on matched sample analyses, difference-in-differences regressions, and a regression discontinuity design. We perform several robustness checks and exclude many alternative explanations, including that firm prestige just proxies for better corporate governance or for increased exposure of the pay-setting process to media attention.","['Florens Focke', 'Ernst Maug', 'Alexandra Niessen-Ruenzi']","['CEO compensation', 'Firm prestige', 'Social status', 'Career benefits']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301799,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,2,Florens Focke,2017,169.7187095139831
Opportunism as a firm and managerial trait: Predicting insider trading profits and misconduct,"We show that opportunistic insiders can be identified through the profitability of their trades prior to quarterly earnings announcements (QEAs) and that opportunistic trading is associated with various kinds of firm or managerial misconduct. A value-weighted trading strategy based on (not necessarily pre-QEA) trades of opportunistic insiders earns monthly four-factor alphas of over 1%, which is much higher than in past insider trading literature and substantial and significant even on the short side. Firms with opportunistic insiders have higher levels of earnings management, restatements, US Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions, shareholder litigation, and executive compensation.

International correlation risk,"We show that the cross-sectional dispersion of conditional foreign exchange (FX) correlation is countercyclical and that currencies that perform badly (well) during periods of high dispersion yield high (low) average excess returns. We also find a negative cross-sectional association between average FX correlations and average option-implied FX correlation risk premiums. Our findings show that while investors in spot currency markets require a positive risk premium for exposure to high dispersion states, FX option prices are consistent with investors being compensated for the risk of low dispersion states. To address our empirical findings, we propose a no-arbitrage model that features unspanned FX correlation risk.","['Philippe Mueller', 'Andreas Stathopoulos', 'Andrea Vedolin']","['Correlation risk', 'Exchange rates', 'International finance']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302155,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,2,Philippe Mueller,2017,169.7187095139831

"Information disclosure, firm growth, and the cost of capital","We study how information disclosure affects the cost of equity capital and investor welfare in a dynamic setting. We show that a firm’s cost of capital decreases (increases) in the precision of public disclosure if the firm’s growth rate is below (above) a certain threshold. The threshold growth rate is higher when the firm’s cash flows are more persistent, or when other firms in the economy are growing at low rates.

Do managers overreact to salient risks? Evidence from hurricane strikes,"We study how managers respond to hurricane events when their firms are located in the neighborhood of the disaster area. We find that the sudden shock to the perceived liquidity risk leads managers to increase corporate cash holdings and to express more concerns about hurricane risk in 10-Ks/10-Qs, even though the actual risk remains unchanged. Both effects are temporary. Over time, the perceived risk decreases, and the bias disappears. The distortion between perceived and actual risk is large, and the increase in cash is suboptimal. Overall, managerial reaction to hurricanes is consistent with salience theories of choice.","['Olivier Dessaint', 'Adrien Matray']","['Behavioral bias', 'Risk perception', 'Corporate cash holdings', 'Availability heuristic', 'Risk management']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301496,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,1,Olivier Dessaint,2017,169.7187095139831
Customer concentration and loan contract terms,"We study pricing and non-pricing features of loan contracts to gauge how the credit market evaluates a firm’s customer-base profile and supply-chain relations. Higher customer concentration increases interest rate spreads and the number of restrictive covenants featured in newly initiated as well as renegotiated bank loans. Customer concentration also abbreviates the maturity of those loans as well as the relationship between firms and their banks. These effects are intensified by customers’ financial distress, the level of relationship-specific investments, and the use of trade credit in customer–supplier relations. Our evidence shows that a deeper exposure to a small set of large customers bears negative consequences for a firm’s relations with its creditors, revealing limits to integration along the supply chain.","['Murillo Campello', 'Janet Gao']","['Customer concentration', 'Bank loans', 'Contract terms', 'Financial distress', 'Instrumental variables']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301738,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,1,Murillo Campello,2017,169.7187095139831
The effects of removing barriers to equity issuance,"We study the consequences of a US deregulation allowing small firms to accelerate their public equity issuance. Post-deregulation, affected firms double their reliance on public equity and transition away from private investments in public equity compared to similar untreated firms. The net effect is a 5.7 percentage point or 49% increase in the annual probability of raising equity. This is accompanied by a reduction in equity issuance costs, an increase in investment, and a decrease in leverage. Our findings provide evidence that reducing equity issuance barriers benefits issuers even in highly developed markets.","['Matthew T.

We find that in response to policies that maintain low interest rates, money funds: change their product offerings by investing in riskier asset classes; are more likely to exit the market; and reduce the fees they charge their investors. The consequence of fund closures resulting from interest rate policy is the relocation of resources in affected fund families and in the asset management industry in general, as well as decline in capital of issuers borrowing from money funds.","['Marco Di Maggio', 'Marcin Kacperczyk']","['Unconventional monetary policy', 'Money funds', 'Risk taking', 'Fund exit']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1630157X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,1,Marco Di Maggio,2017,169.7187095139831
Explaining the negative returns to volatility claims: An equilibrium approach,"We study the returns to investing in VIX futures, VIX Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), and variance swaps. We document substantial negative return premia for these assets. For example, the constant maturity portfolio of 1-month VIX futures loses about 30% per year over our sample period (2006–2013).

The term structure of returns: Facts and theory,"We summarize and extend the new literature on the term structure of equity. Short-term equity claims, or dividend strips, have higher average returns and Sharpe ratios than the aggregate stock market. The returns on short-term dividend claims are risky as measured by volatility, but safe as measured by market beta. These facts are hard to reconcile with traditional macro-finance models and we provide an overview of new models that can reproduce some of these facts. We relate our evidence on dividend strips to facts about other asset classes such as nominal and corporate bonds, volatility, and housing. We discuss the broader economic implications of our findings by linking the term structure of returns to real economic decisions such as hiring and investment. We conclude with an outline of empirical and theoretical extensions that we consider interesting avenues for future research.","['Jules H. van Binsbergen', 'Ralph S.J.

Offshore schemes and tax evasion: The role of banks,"We use mandatory Russian banks’ reports to the Central Bank to construct a novel measure of offshore-banking. Individual bank involvement in offshore operations is calculated as a fraction of total transactions with foreign countries that go through offshore financial centers. We find that offshore-active banks perform less financial intermediation and focus more on international wire transfers. We show a positive relation between banks’ offshore activities and tax evasion of companies doing business through these banks. Finally, we show that the Central Bank eventually responds to this behavior: offshore-active banks have higher likelihood of license revocation and criminal investigation against top-management.","['Lucy Chernykh', 'Sergey Mityakov']","['Financial institutions', 'Offshore banking', 'Tax evasion']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302362,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,126,3,Lucy Chernykh,2017,169.7187095139831
"Option repricing, corporate governance, and the effect of shareholder empowerment","We use the practice of employee option repricing to investigate how shareholder involvement in firm compensation policies affects the quality of firm governance. We find that a 2003 reform that empowered shareholders to approve or reject repricing proposals led to value increases in previous repricers. The likelihood of repricing becomes less sensitive to poor manager performance, but remains similarly sensitive to bad luck, after the reform. Average post-repricing changes in firm performance are positive only after the reform. Overall, our results suggest that shareholder empowerment improves the governance of repricing and can transform repricing into a value-creating tool.","['Huseyin Gulen', ""William J.

Diversification and cash dynamics,"Why do diversified firms hold significantly less cash than focused firms? We study this question using a dynamic model of corporate investment, saving, and diversification decisions. We find that investment dynamics are more important in explaining the cash differences than financing frictions. More efficient internal capital markets increase cash differences and are especially valuable when a firm diversifies or refocuses. Contrary to static models, more diverse conglomerates have lower cash differences. Endogenous selection (diversifying firms are larger and have better growth opportunities) accounts for 68% of the cash difference, and the diversification event itself reduces cash holdings by 32%.","['Tor-Erik Bakke', 'Tiantian Gu']","['Diversification', 'Organizational structure', 'Corporate saving', 'Internal capital markets', 'Investment']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302410,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9908767556297726,123,3,Tor-Erik Bakke,2017,169.7187095139831
Rollover risk as market discipline: A two-sided inefficiency,"Why does the market discipline that financial intermediaries face seem too weak during booms and too strong during crises? This paper shows in a general equilibrium setting that rollover risk as a disciplining device is effective only if all intermediaries face purely idiosyncratic risk. However, if assets are correlated, a two-sided inefficiency arises: Good aggregate states have intermediaries taking excessive risks, while bad aggregate states suffer from costly fire sales. The driving force behind this inefficiency is an amplifying feedback loop between asset values and market discipline. In equilibrium, financial intermediaries inefficiently amplify both positive and negative aggregate shocks.",['Thomas M.

Early option exercise: Never say never,"A classic result by Merton (1973) is that, except just before expiration or dividend payments, one should never exercise a call option and never convert a convertible bond. We show theoretically that this result is overturned when investors face frictions. Early option exercise can be optimal when it reduces short-sale costs, transaction costs, or funding costs. We provide consistent empirical evidence, documenting billions of dollars of early exercise for options and convertible bonds using unique data on actual exercise decisions and frictions. Our model can explain as much as 98% of early exercises by market makers and 67% by customers.","['Mads Vestergaard Jensen', 'Lasse Heje Pedersen']","['Option exercise', 'Frictions', 'Short-sale costs', 'Transaction costs', 'Convertible bonds']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1630099X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,121,2,Mads Vestergaard Jensen,2016,169.63456538432817

Also, firms in competitive industries earn higher expected returns than firms in concentrated industries, especially among R&D-intensive firms.

"Accruals, cash flows, and operating profitability in the cross section of stock returns","Accruals are the non-cash component of earnings. They represent adjustments made to cash flows to generate a profit measure largely unaffected by the timing of receipts and payments of cash. Prior research uncovers two anomalies: expected returns increase in profitability and decrease in accruals. We show that cash-based operating profitability (a measure that excludes accruals) outperforms measures of profitability that include accruals. Further, cash-based operating profitability subsumes accruals in predicting the cross section of average returns. An investor can increase a strategy’s Sharpe ratio more by adding just a cash-based operating profitability factor to the investment opportunity set than by adding both an accruals factor and a profitability factor that includes accruals.","['Ray Ball', 'Joseph Gerakos', 'Juhani T.

Patient capital outperformance: The investment skill of high active share managers who trade infrequently,"Among high active share portfolios—whose holdings differ substantially from their benchmark—only those with patient investment strategies (with holding durations of over two years) on average outperform, over 2% per year. Funds trading frequently generally underperform, including those with high active share. Among patient funds, separating closet index from high active share funds matters, as low active share funds on average underperform even with patient strategies. Our results suggest that U.S. equity markets provide opportunities for longer-term active managers, perhaps because of the limited arbitrage capital devoted to patient and active investment strategies.","['Martijn Cremers', 'Ankur Pareek']",[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301441,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,2,Martijn Cremers,2016,169.63456538432817
Double bank runs and liquidity risk management,"By providing liquidity to depositors and credit-line borrowers, banks can be exposed to double-runs on assets and liabilities. For identification, we exploit the 2007 freeze of the European interbank market and the Italian Credit Register. After the shock, there are sizeable, aggregate double-runs. In the cross-section, credit-line drawdowns are not larger for banks more exposed to the interbank market; however, they are larger when we condition on the same firms with multiple credit lines. We show that, ex-ante, more exposed banks actively manage their liquidity risk by granting fewer credit lines to firms that run more during crises.","['Filippo Ippolito', 'José-Luis Peydró', 'Andrea Polo', 'Enrico Sette']","['Credit lines', 'Liquidity risk', 'Financial crisis', 'Runs', 'Basel III']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301076,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,1,Filippo Ippolito,2016,169.63456538432817
Target revaluation after failed takeover attempts: Cash versus stock,"Cash- and stock-financed takeover bids induce strikingly different target revaluations. We exploit detailed data on unsuccessful takeover bids between 1980 and 2008, and we show that targets of cash offers are revalued on average by +15% after deal failure, whereas stock targets return to their pre-announcement levels. The differences in revaluation do not revert over longer horizons. We find no evidence that future takeover activities or operational changes explain these differences. While the targets of failed cash and stock offers are both more likely to be acquired over the following eight years than matched control firms, no differences exist between cash and stock targets, either in the timing or in the value of future offers. Similarly, we cannot detect differential operational policies following the failed bid. Our results are most consistent with cash bids revealing prior undervaluation of the target. We reconcile our findings with the opposite conclusion in earlier literature (Bradley, Desai, and Kim, 1983) by identifying a look-ahead bias built into their sample construction.","['Ulrike Malmendier', 'Marcus M.

Revolving doors on Wall Street,"Credit analysts often leave rating agencies to work at firms they rate.

We find no evidence that analysts inflate ratings of other firms they rate. Market based measures of hiring firms' credit quality further indicate that transitioning analysts' inflated ratings become less informative.

Momentum crashes,"Despite their strong positive average returns across numerous asset classes, momentum strategies can experience infrequent and persistent strings of negative returns. These momentum crashes are partly forecastable. They occur in panic states, following market declines and when market volatility is high, and are contemporaneous with market rebounds. The low ex ante expected returns in panic states are consistent with a conditionally high premium attached to the option like payoffs of past losers. An implementable dynamic momentum strategy based on forecasts of momentum’s mean and variance approximately doubles the alpha and Sharpe ratio of a static momentum strategy and is not explained by other factors.

Taxes and leverage at multinational corporations,"Empirical research has struggled to show that variation in corporate capital structure arises from variation in estimated corporate income tax rates. We argue that, in previous studies, both the tax rates applied to multinational corporations and the taxable income earned have been mismeasured. Using the Bureau of Economic Analysis annual survey sample combined with each firm's income and country specific tax rate, we find that firms do have higher leverage ratios and lower interest coverage ratios when they operate in countries with higher tax rates, as theory would suggest.

Using robust univariate regressions and matched control samples, almost all evidence of excess comovement disappears. In both examples, the stocks exhibit strong returns prior to the event, akin to momentum winners. We document that winner stocks exhibit increases in betas, generating much of the apparent excess comovement.","['Honghui Chen', 'Vijay Singal', 'Robert F.

The first reform increases interest rates and reduces investment. The second reform reduces interest rates and spurs investment.

Bridging the gap: the design of bank loan contracts and distance,"How do the distance constraints faced by lenders in acquiring borrower information affect the design of bank loan contracts?

Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that, upon inception, contracts tend to be more restrictive when firms seek loans from remote lenders. This finding is robust to potential endogeneity bias and simultaneity of various loan terms.

Using the cutoff in a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, I show that borrowers are willing to pay the equivalent of 11% of their monthly income for a good reputation.

When the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is used, firms with a high cost of equity invest more. When the implied cost of capital is used, firms with a high cost of equity invest less. The implied cost of capital can better reflect the time-varying required return on capital. The CAPM measure reflects forces that are outside the standard model.","['Murray Z.

"Dual ownership, returns, and voting in mergers","In Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) a significant proportion of targets’ equity is owned by financial institutions that simultaneously own targets’ bonds (“dual holders”). Targets with larger equity ownership by dual holders have lower M&A equity premia and larger abnormal bond returns, particularly when dual holders stand to benefit more from appreciation of their bond stakes, e.g., when their bond ownership in the target is large and the target credit rating is non-investment grade. Dual holders are more likely to vote in favor of the merger proposal. Our results suggest the presence of coordination of decisions within dual holding financial conglomerates in M&A targets.","['Andriy Bodnaruk', 'Marco Rossi']","['Dual holders', 'Shareholders', 'Bondholders', 'M&As', 'Financial conglomerates']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000271,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,1,Andriy Bodnaruk,2016,169.63456538432817
Socially responsible firms,"In the corporate finance tradition, starting with Berle and Means (1932), corporations should generally be run to maximize shareholder value. The agency view of corporate social responsibility (CSR) considers CSR an agency problem and a waste of corporate resources. Given our identification strategy by means of an instrumental variable approach, we find that well-governed firms that suffer less from agency concerns (less cash abundance, positive pay-for-performance, small control wedge, strong minority protection) engage more in CSR. We also find that a positive relation exists between CSR and value and that CSR attenuates the negative relation between managerial entrenchment and value.","['Allen Ferrell', 'Hao Liang', 'Luc Renneboog']","['Corporate social responsibility', 'Agency costs', 'Corporate governance']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301519,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,3,Allen Ferrell,2016,169.63456538432817
"Debt-equity choices, R&D investment and market timing","In this paper, we examine whether managers time their debt-equity choices to exploit market mispricing. Controlling for the level of external financing and corporate investment activities, we find evidence consistent with the market timing hypothesis. We find managers issue more equity relative to debt when analysts are relatively optimistic about firms’ long-term growth prospects. Moreover, equity issuers earn lower returns than debt issuers at subsequent earnings announcements. Controlling for research and development (R&D) investment, we find that, consistent with the market timing hypothesis and inconsistent with the extant empirical literature, the debt-equity composition of external financing predicts year-ahead stock return.","['Craig M.

A trend factor: Any economic gains from using information over investment horizons?,"In this paper, we provide a trend factor that captures simultaneously all three stock price trends: the short-, intermediate-, and long-term, by exploiting information in moving average prices of various time lengths whose predictive power is justified by a proposed general equilibrium model. It outperforms substantially the well-known short-term reversal, momentum, and long-term reversal factors, which are based on the three price trends separately, by more than doubling their Sharpe ratios. During the recent financial crisis, the trend factor earns 0.75% per month, while the market loses −2.03% per month, the short-term reversal factor loses −0.82%, the momentum factor loses −3.88%, and the long-term reversal factor barely gains 0.03%. The performance of the trend factor is robust to alternative formations and to a variety of control variables.

Borrower protection and the supply of credit: Evidence from foreclosure laws,"Laws governing the foreclosure process can have direct consequences for the costs of foreclosure and, therefore could affect lending decisions. We exploit the heterogeneity in judicial requirements across US states to examine their impact on banks’ lending decisions in a sample of urban areas straddling state borders. A key feature of our study is the way it exploits an exogenous cutoff in loan eligibility to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) guarantees, which shift the burden of foreclosure costs onto the GSEs. We find that judicial requirements reduce the supply of credit only for jumbo loans, which are ineligible for GSE guarantees, i.e., in the nonsubsidized segment of the market. Thus, while we find a significant effect on credit supply, the aggregate impact is muted by the indirect cross-subsidy by the GSEs to borrower-friendly states.","['Jihad Dagher', 'Yangfan Sun']","['Borrower protection', 'Foreclosure laws', 'Credit supply', 'Regulation', 'GSEs']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300034,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,121,1,Jihad Dagher,2016,169.63456538432817

Our method estimates the full value effect of Obamacare on the healthcare sector as $55 billion, compared to $16 billion when market anticipation is ignored.

Who neglects risk? Investor experience and the credit boom,"Many have argued that overoptimistic thinking on the part of lenders helps fuel credit booms. We use new micro-data on mutual funds’ holdings of securitizations to examine which investors are susceptible to such boom-time thinking. We show that firsthand experience plays a key role in shaping investors’ beliefs. During the 2003–2007 mortgage boom, inexperienced fund managers loaded up on securitizations linked to nonprime mortgages, accumulating twice the holdings of more seasoned managers. Moreover, inexperienced managers who personally experienced severe or recent adverse investment outcomes behaved more like seasoned managers.

Time is money: Rational life cycle inertia and the delegation of investment management,"Many households display inertia in investment management over their life cycles. Our calibrated dynamic life cycle portfolio choice model can account for such an apparently ‘irrational’ outcome, by incorporating the fact that investors must forgo acquiring job-specific skills when they spend time managing their money, and their efficiency in financial decision making varies with age. Resulting inertia patterns mesh well with findings from prior studies and our own empirical results from Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data. We also analyze how people optimally choose between actively managing their assets versus delegating the task to financial advisors. Delegation proves valuable to both the young and the old. Our calibrated model quantifies welfare gains from including investment time and money costs as well as delegation in a life cycle setting.","['Hugh Hoikwang Kim', 'Raimond Maurer', 'Olivia S.

Fragility in money market funds: Sponsor support and regulation,"Money market funds (MMFs), which are crucial to short-term funding markets, rely on voluntary support of fund sponsors to maintain stable share values. I develop a general equilibrium model of MMFs to study how sponsor support affects the industry’s fragility and regulation. Adverse asset-quality shocks lead MMFs to liquidate assets. When liquidity in asset markets is limited, asset prices are lower if more funds liquidate. Lower asset prices, in turn, make sponsor support costlier and even more liquidations occur. This feedback leads to complementarities in sponsors’ support decisions. Based on the model’s insights, I derive implications for the regulation of MMFs.",['Cecilia Parlatore'],"['Fragility', 'Money market funds', 'Sponsor support', 'Regulation', 'Liquidity']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300848,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,121,3,Cecilia Parlatore,2016,169.63456538432817
Mortgage companies and regulatory arbitrage,"Mortgage companies (MCs) do not fall under the strict regulatory regime of depository institutions. We empirically show that this gap resulted in regulatory arbitrage and allowed bank holding companies (BHCs) to circumvent consumer compliance regulations, mitigate capital requirements, and reduce exposure to loan-related losses. Compared to bank subsidiaries, MC subsidiaries of BHCs originated riskier mortgages to borrowers with lower credit scores, lower incomes, higher loan-to-income ratios, and higher default rates. Our results imply that precrisis regulations had the capacity to mitigate the deterioration of lending standards if consistently applied and enforced for all types of intermediaries.","['Yuliya Demyanyk', 'Elena Loutskina']","['Regulation', 'Banks', 'Mortgage companies', 'Mortgages', 'Financial crisis']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301246,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,2,Yuliya Demyanyk,2016,169.63456538432817
Redacting proprietary information at the initial public offering,"Nearly 40% of IPO firms redact information from their SEC registration filings. These firms exhibit characteristics consistent with the need to shield proprietary information from potential rivals. They experience greater underpricing, but pre-IPO insiders reduce underpricing-related wealth transfers by selling proportionately less of the firm's shares at the IPO, raising more equity financing in later seasoned equity offerings, and selling their own holdings at a relatively slow pace. The information environment of redacting firms reflects proportionately more private information than that of non-redacting firms post-IPO, but this difference abates by the fourth year. Consistent with the view that redacted proprietary information provides competitive advantages, redacting firms exhibit superior financial performance post-IPO. The results illustrate tradeoffs in balancing a firm's needs to protect proprietary information with its capital needs, investor needs for information to price securities, and pre-IPO owner liquidity needs.","['Audra L.

To examine whether and by which mechanisms passive investors influence firms' governance, we exploit variation in ownership by passive mutual funds associated with stock assignments to the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes. Our findings suggest that passive mutual funds influence firms' governance choices, resulting in more independent directors, removal of takeover defenses, and more equal voting rights. Passive investors appear to exert influence through their large voting blocs, and consistent with the observed governance differences increasing firm value, passive ownership is associated with improvements in firms’ longer-term performance.","['Ian R.

On secondary buyouts,"Private equity firms increasingly sell companies to each other in secondary buyouts (SBOs), raising concerns which we examine using novel data sets.

Investors then reduce their capital allocation to the firms doing those transactions. But not all SBOs are money-burning devices. SBOs made under no pressure to spend perform as well as other buyouts. When buyer and seller have complementary skill sets, SBOs outperform other buyouts. Investors do not pay higher total transaction costs as a result of SBOs, even if they have a stake in both the buying fund and the selling fund.","['Francois Degeorge', 'Jens Martin', 'Ludovic Phalippou']","['Private equity', 'Buyouts', 'Performance', 'Secondary buyouts']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001464,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,1,Francois Degeorge,2016,169.63456538432817
Disaster recovery and the term structure of dividend strips,"Recent empirical findings document downward-sloping term structures of equity return volatility and risk premia. An equilibrium model with rare disasters followed by recoveries helps reconcile theory with empirical observations. Indeed, recoveries outweigh the upward-sloping effect of time-varying disaster intensity and expected growth, generating downward-sloping term structures of dividend growth risk, equity return volatility, and equity risk premia. In addition, the term structure of interest rates is upward-sloping when accounting for recoveries and downward-sloping otherwise. The model quantitatively reconciles high risk premia and a low risk-free rate with the shape of the term structures, which are at odds in other models.","['Michael Hasler', 'Roberto Marfè']","['Recovery', 'Rare disasters', 'Term structures of equity', 'Dividend strips', 'Asset pricing puzzles']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301040,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,1,Michael Hasler,2016,169.63456538432817

Shareholder nonparticipation in valuable rights offerings: New findings for an old puzzle,"Shareholder participation in valuable domestic rights offerings averages only 64%, which is considerably lower than previously asserted. This causes wealth transfers from nonparticipating to participating shareholders that average 7% of the offering. Wealth transfers are larger in nontransferable and bigger offerings. The stock market reacts more negatively to larger wealth transfers. Offerings with lower shareholder participation also fall short in raising publicly stated capital goals. Rights offerings are far more common in countries with institutional practices that limit nonparticipating shareholders’ wealth losses.

In contrast, we show that, on average, target leverage ratios evolve counter-cyclically once cyclicality is measured comprehensively, accounting for variation in explanatory variables and model parameters. These counter-cyclical dynamics are robust to different subsamples of firms, data samples, empirical models of leverage, and definitions of leverage.

In line with a powerful risk-shifting channel, we find that fund investors in countries with decreased real interest rates shift their portfolio investment out of the money market and into the riskier equity market, causing significant equity price inflation in countries where investment home bias is the strongest.","['Harald Hau', 'Sandy Lai']","['Monetary policy', 'Asset price inflation', 'Risk-shifting', 'Taylor rule residuals']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000192,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,2,Harald Hau,2016,169.63456538432817
Short selling meets hedge fund 13F: An anatomy of informed demand,"The existing literature treats the short side (i.e., short selling) and the long side of hedge fund trading (i.e., fund holdings) independently. The two sides, however, complement each other: opposite changes in the two are likely to be driven by information, whereas simultaneous increases (decreases) of the two may be motivated by hedging (unwinding) considerations. We use this intuition to identify informed demand and document that it exhibits highly significant predictive power over returns (approximately 10% per year). We also find that informed demand forecasts future firm fundamentals, suggesting that hedge funds play an important role in information discovery.","['Yawen Jiao', 'Massimo Massa', 'Hong Zhang']","['Short selling', 'Hedge funds', '13F', 'Informed demand', 'Hedging']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301520,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,3,Yawen Jiao,2016,169.63456538432817

Since 1960, price informativeness has increased at longer horizons (three to five years). The increase is concentrated among firms with greater institutional ownership and share turnover, firms with options trading, and growth firms. Prices have also become a stronger predictor of investment, and investment a stronger predictor of cash flows.

Issuers during cheap seasons appear to have less immediate needs, but are enticed by low rates to engage in precautionary borrowing.

The commitment problem of secured lending,"The paper presents a new theory of trade credit in which firms buy inputs on credit from suppliers to restore the benefits of secured bank financing impaired by contract incompleteness. In a setting where investment is endogenous and unobservable to financiers, we show that a bank-secured credit contract is time-inconsistent. Upon being granted credit, the entrepreneur has an incentive to alter the original input combination, jeopardizing the bank’s revenues. Anticipating the entrepreneur’s opportunism, the bank offers an unsecured credit contract, reducing the surplus from the venture. One way for the entrepreneur to commit to the contract terms is to purchase inputs on credit from the supplier. The supplier observes the input investment and acts as a guarantor that inputs will be purchased as contracted, thus facilitating access to secured bank financing. The commitment role of trade credit still holds in a multi-period extension that investigates the impact of bank relationship lending on secured debt and trade credit. Our model provides novel testable predictions on optimal financial contracts in both one-period and repeated lending relationships.","['Daniela Fabbri', 'Anna Maria C.

Previous models leave out some of the components of performance, and correcting for this we deliver better measures of selectivity.

Under new management: Equity issues and the attribution of past returns,"There is a strong link between measures of stock market performance and subsequent equity issues. We find that management turnover weakens the link between equity issues and the returns that preceded the new chief executive officer (CEO). Moreover, there is a discontinuity in the distribution of equity issues around the specific share price that the CEO inherited, while there is no discontinuity around salient share prices prior to turnover. The evidence suggests that capital allocation involves an attribution of past returns not only to the firm but also to its CEO. A corollary is that a firm with poor stock market performance may be better able to raise new capital if its current CEO is replaced.","['Malcolm Baker', 'Yuhai Xuan']","['Equity issues', 'Seasoned equity offerings', 'Reference point', 'CEO turnover']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300290,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,121,1,Malcolm Baker,2016,169.63456538432817
"Playing it safe? Managerial preferences, risk, and agency conflicts","This article examines managers’ incentive to play it safe. We find that, after managers are insulated by the adoption of an antitakeover law, they take value-destroying actions that reduce their firms’ stock volatility and risk of distress. To illustrate one such action, we show that managers undertake diversifying acquisitions that target firms likely to reduce risk, have negative announcement returns, and are concentrated among firms with managers who gain the most from reducing risk. Our findings suggest that instruments typically used to motivate managers, such as greater financial leverage and larger ownership stakes, exacerbate risk-related agency challenges.","['Todd A.

Systemic risk and the macroeconomy: An empirical evaluation,This article studies how systemic risk and financial market distress affect the distribution of shocks to real economic activity. We analyze how changes in 19 different measures of systemic risk skew the distribution of subsequent shocks to industrial production and other macroeconomic variables in the US and Europe over several decades. We also propose dimension reduction estimators for constructing systemic risk indexes from the cross section of measures and demonstrate their success in predicting future macroeconomic shocks out of sample.,"['Stefano Giglio', 'Bryan Kelly', 'Seth Pruitt']","['Systemic risk', 'Quantile regression', 'Dimension reduction', 'Macroeconomy']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000143,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,3,Stefano Giglio,2016,169.63456538432817
The cross-sectional variation of volatility risk premia,"This paper analyzes the determinants of the cross-sectional variation of the average volatility risk premia for a representative set of portfolios sorted by volatility risk premium beta. The market volatility risk premium and, especially, the default premium are shown to be key risk factors in the cross-sectional variation of average volatility risk premium payoffs. The cross-sectional variation of risk premia seems to reflect a very different behavior of the underlying components of our sample portfolios with respect to credit or financial stress that generates a significant dispersion of the volatility swap pricing of these securities.","['Ana González-Urteaga', 'Gonzalo Rubio']","['Volatility risk premia', 'Stochastic discount factor', 'Consumption-based models', 'Linear factor models', 'Default premium']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001762,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,2,Ana González-Urteaga,2016,169.63456538432817
Decision-making approaches and the propensity to default: Evidence and implications,"This paper examines heterogeneity in the responsiveness to default options in a large state retirement plan, focusing on individuals’ decision-making approaches as well as their economic and demographic characteristics. Analyses of a survey of plan participants show that procrastination and the need for cognitive closure are important determinants of the likelihood of default. This paper also explores an important implication of defaulting—individuals who default are significantly more likely to subsequently express a desire to enroll in a different plan. The desire to change plans is also correlated with numerous economic and decision-making characteristics, including procrastination.","['Jeffrey R. Brown', 'Anne M. Farrell', 'Scott J.

Can analysts pick stocks for the long-run?,"This paper examines post-revision return drift, or PRD, following analysts’ revisions of their stock recommendations. PRD refers to the finding that the analysts’ recommendation changes predict future long-term returns in the same direction as the change (i.e., upgrades are followed by positive returns, and downgrades are followed by negative returns). During the high-frequency algorithmic trading period of 2003–2010, average PRD is no longer significantly different from zero. The new findings agree with improved market efficiency after declines in real trading cost inefficiencies. They are consistent with a reduced information production role for analysts in the supercomputer era.","['Oya Altınkılıç', 'Robert S.

Are retail traders compensated for providing liquidity?,"This paper examines the extent to which individual investors provide liquidity to the stock market and whether they are compensated for doing so. We show that the ability of aggregate retail order imbalances, contrarian in nature, to predict short-term future returns is significantly enhanced during times of market stress, when market liquidity provisions decline. While a weekly rebalanced portfolio long in stocks purchased and short in stocks sold by retail investors delivers 19% annualized excess returns over a four-factor model from 2002 to 2010, it delivers up to 40% annualized returns in periods of high uncertainty. Despite this high aggregate performance, individual investors do not reap the rewards from liquidity provision because they experience a negative return on the day of their trade and they reverse their trades long after the excess returns from liquidity provision are dissipated. During the financial crisis, French active retail stock traders stepped up to the plate, increased stock holdings, and provided liquidity. In contrast, mutual fund investors fled from delegation by selling their mutual funds.","['Jean-Noel Barrot', 'Ron Kaniel', 'David Sraer']","['Liquidity', 'Retail investors', 'Crisis']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000064,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,1,Jean-Noel Barrot,2016,169.63456538432817

Does Dodd-Frank affect OTC transaction costs and liquidity? Evidence from real-time CDS trade reports,"This paper examines transaction costs and liquidity in the index CDS market by matching intraday quotes to real-time trade reports made available through the Dodd-Frank reforms. We find that the average relative effective spread is 0.27% of price level or 2.73% of CDS spread. Dodd-Frank does affect transaction costs and liquidity. Liquidity improves after the commencement of public dissemination of OTC derivatives trades. Moreover, cleared trades, trades executed on exchange-like venues, end-user trades, and bespoke trades exhibit lower trading costs, price impact, and price dispersion. These findings improve our understanding of the OTC derivatives market that is undergoing fundamental changes.","['Yee Cheng Loon', 'Zhaodong (Ken) Zhong']","['Dodd-Frank Act', 'Over-the-counter markets', 'Liquidity', 'Real-time trade reporting', 'Credit default swaps']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000258,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,3,Yee Cheng Loon,2016,169.63456538432817
The value of creditor control in corporate bonds,"This paper introduces a measure that captures the premium in bond prices that is due to the value of creditor control. We estimate the premium as the difference in the bond price and an equivalent synthetic bond without control rights that is constructed using credit default swap (CDS) contracts. We find empirically that this premium increases as firm credit quality decreases and around important credit events such as defaults, bankruptcies, and covenant violations. The increase is greatest for bonds most pivotal to changes in control. Changes in bond and CDS liquidity do not appear to drive increases in the premium.","['Peter Feldhütter', 'Edith Hotchkiss', 'Oğuzhan Karakaş']","['Creditor control', 'Corporate bonds', 'Distress', 'Bankruptcy', 'CDS']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300460,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,121,1,Peter Feldhütter,2016,169.63456538432817
The impact of unconventional monetary policy on firm financing constraints: Evidence from the maturity extension program,"This paper investigates the impact of unconventional monetary policy on firm financial constraints using the maturity extension program (MEP). Consistent with bond market segmentation and limits to arbitrage, around the MEP's announcement, stock prices rose for those firms more dependent on longer-term debt. These firms also issued more long-term debt during the MEP and expanded employment and investment. There is also evidence of “reach for yield” behavior, as the demand for riskier corporate debt also increased. Our results suggest that unconventional monetary policy might have relaxed financial constraints for some firms by inducing gap-filling behavior and affecting bond market risk premia.","['Nathan Foley-Fisher', 'Rodney Ramcharan', 'Edison Yu']","['Unconventional monetary policy', 'Firm-financial constraints', 'Bond markets']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301234,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,2,Nathan Foley-Fisher,2016,169.63456538432817
The leverage externalities of credit default swaps,"This paper provides the first empirical evidence of the externalities of credit default swaps (CDS). We find that a firm's leverage is lower when a larger proportion of its revenue is derived from CDS-referenced customers. This finding is robust to alternative samples and measures, placebo tests, and the selection of customers by suppliers. Moreover, firms affected by customer CDS trading issue equity to lower leverage, and their equity issuance costs are lower. These findings are consistent with the view that CDS trading on customers improves the information environment for suppliers. Therefore, while many firms are not directly linked to CDS trading, CDS trading on their customers has spillover effects on these firms’ financial policies.","['Jay Yin Li', 'Dragon Yongjun Tang']","['Credit default swaps', 'CDS', 'Customer–supplier relationship', 'Leverage', 'Externalities']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300058,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,3,Jay Yin Li,2016,169.63456538432817
Taxes and bank capital structure,"This paper shows that a reduction in tax discrimination between debt and equity funding leads to better capitalized financial institutions. The paper exploits exogenous variation in the tax treatment of debt and equity created by the introduction of a tax shield for equity. The results demonstrate that a more equal treatment of debt and equity increases bank capital ratios, driven by an increase in common equity. The change also leads to a significant reduction in risk taking for ex-ante low capitalized banks. Overall, the findings suggest that tax shields could be a valuable and innovative policy tool for bank regulators.",['Glenn Schepens'],"['Bank capital structure', 'Bank regulation', 'Tax shields']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000209,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,3,Glenn Schepens,2016,169.63456538432817
"Sentiments, financial markets, and macroeconomic fluctuations","This paper studies how financial information frictions can generate sentiment-driven fluctuations in asset prices and self-fulfilling business cycles. In our model economy, exuberant financial market sentiments of high output and high demand for capital increase the price of capital, which signals strong fundamentals of the economy to the real side and consequently leads to an actual boom in real output and employment. The model further derives implications for asymmetric nonlinear asset prices and for economic contagion and co-movement across countries. In the extension to the dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) setting, our model demonstrates that sentiment shocks can generate persistent output, employment, and business cycle fluctuations, and it offers some new implications for asset prices over business cycles.","['Jess Benhabib', 'Xuewen Liu', 'Pengfei Wang']","['Financial sector', 'Sentiment-driven fluctuations', 'Self-fulfilling business cycles', 'Beauty contests', 'Animal spirits']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000106,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,2,Jess Benhabib,2016,169.63456538432817

"Time-to-produce, inventory, and asset prices","Time-to-build, time-to-produce, and inventory have important implications for asset prices and quantity dynamics in a general equilibrium model with recursive preferences. Time-to-build captures the delay in transforming new investments into productive capital, and time-to-produce captures the delay in transforming productive capital into output. Both delays increase risks in that time-to-build generates procyclical payouts, whereas the time-to-produce amplifies this procyclicality. Inventory smooths consumption and helps capture interest rate volatility even when the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is small. The model is consistent with a high equity premium, a high stock return volatility, and lead-lag relations between asset prices and macroeconomic quantities.",['Zhanhui Chen'],"['Time-to-build', 'Time-to-produce', 'Inventory', 'Recursive preferences', 'Asset prices']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000088,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,2,Zhanhui Chen,2016,169.63456538432817

These changes are concentrated in firms with high excess pay and shareholder dissent, long CEO tenure, and less independent boards. Further, the portion of top management pay captured by CEOs is lower in the post-SoP period, which is associated with higher firm valuations.

The ownership and trading of debt claims in Chapter 11 restructurings,"Using a novel data set that covers individual debt claims against 136 bankrupt US companies and includes information on a subset of claims transfers, we provide new empirical insight regarding how a firm’s debt ownership relates to bankruptcy outcomes. Firms with higher debt concentration at the start of the case are more likely to file prearranged bankruptcy plans, to move quickly through the restructuring process, and to emerge successfully as independent going concerns. Moreover, higher ownership concentration within a debt class is associated with higher recovery rates to that class. Trading of claims during bankruptcy concentrates ownership further, but this trading is not associated with subsequent improvements in bankruptcy outcomes and could, at the margin, increase the likelihood of liquidation.","['Victoria Ivashina', 'Benjamin Iverson', 'David C.

The influence of political bias in state pension funds,"Using a sample of state pension funds’ equity holdings, we find evidence of not only local bias, but also bias towards politically-connected stocks. Political bias is detrimental to fund performance. State pension funds have longer holding durations of politically-connected local firms and display disposition behavior in these positions. Political bias is positively related to the percentage of politically-affiliated trustees on the board and Congressional connections. The more politically-affiliated trustees on the board, the more the fund shifts toward risky asset allocations. Overall, our results imply that political bias is likely costly to taxpayers and pension beneficiaries.","['Daniel Bradley', 'Christos Pantzalis', 'Xiaojing Yuan']","['State pension funds', 'Political bias', 'Pension beneficiaries', 'Disposition effect']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001671,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,1,Daniel Bradley,2016,169.63456538432817
How do CEOs see their roles? Management philosophies and styles in family and non-family firms,"Using a survey of 800 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in 22 emerging economies, we show that CEOs' management styles and philosophies vary with the ownership and governance structure of their firms. Founders and CEOs of firms with greater family involvement display a greater stakeholder focus, and feel more accountable to employees and banks than to shareholders. They also have a more hierarchical management approach, and see their role as maintaining the status quo rather than bringing about change. In contrast, CEOs of non-family firms emphasize shareholder-value-maximization. Finally, firm-level variation in ownership is as important in explaining management philosophies as cross-country or industry-level differences.","['William Mullins', 'Antoinette Schoar']","['CEOs', 'Founder', 'Family firms', 'Stakeholders', 'Delegation']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001506,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,1,William Mullins,2016,169.63456538432817

Market conditions lower aggregate participation via their impact on trading profits and risk. Contrary to regulatory view, higher stock volatility is associated with more participation and higher profits, even after controlling for other market conditions, including stock volume. Fragility concerns extend to larger stocks and to active participants.

Clouded judgment: The role of sentiment in credit origination,"Using daily fluctuations in local sunshine as an instrument for sentiment, we study its effect on day-to-day decisions of lower-level financial officers. Positive sentiment is associated with higher credit approvals, and negative sentiment has the opposite effect of a larger magnitude. These effects are stronger when financial decisions require more discretion, when reviews are less automated, and when capital constraints are less binding. The variation in approval rates affects ex post financial performance and produces significant real effects.

Local financial capacity and asset values: Evidence from bank failures,"Using differences in regulation as a means of identification, we find that a reduction in local financial intermediation capacity reduces the recovery rates on assets of failing banks. It also depresses local land prices and is associated with subsequent distress in nearby banks. Fire sales appear to be one channel through which lower local intermediation capacity reduces the recovery rates on failed banks’ assets.

Further, the association between corruption and leverage is largest among firms that operate primarily around their headquarters.

"Underwriter networks, investor attention, and initial public offerings","Using various centrality measures from social network analysis, we analyze how the location of a lead initial public offering (IPO) underwriter in its network of investment banks affects various IPO characteristics. We hypothesize that investment banking networks allow lead IPO underwriters to induce institutions to pay attention to the firms they take public and to perform two information-related roles during the IPO process: an information dissemination role, in which the lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to disseminate noisy information about various aspects of the IPO firm to institutional investors; and an information extraction role, in which the lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to extract information useful in pricing the IPO firm equity from institutional investors. Based on these two roles, we develop testable hypotheses relating lead IPO underwriter centrality to the IPO characteristics of firms they take public. We find that more central lead IPO underwriters are associated with larger absolute values of offer price revisions, greater IPO and after-market valuations, larger IPO initial returns, greater institutional investor equity holdings and analyst coverage immediately post-IPO, greater stock liquidity post-IPO, and better long-run stock returns. Using a hand-collected data set of pre-IPO media coverage as a proxy for investor attention, we show that an important channel through which more central lead IPO underwriters achieve favorable IPO characteristics is by attracting greater investor attention to the IPOs underwritten by them.","['Emanuele Bajo', 'Thomas J.

Securities trading by banks and credit supply: Micro-evidence from the crisis,"We analyze securities trading by banks during the crisis and the associated spillovers to the supply of credit. We use a proprietary data set that has the investments of banks at the security level for 2005–2012 in conjunction with the credit register from Germany. We find that—during the crisis—banks with higher trading expertise (trading banks) increase their investments in securities, especially in those that had a larger price drop, with the strongest impact in low-rated and long-term securities. Moreover, trading banks reduce their credit supply, and the credit crunch is binding at the firm level. All of the effects are more pronounced for trading banks with higher capital levels. Finally, banks use central bank liquidity and government subsidies like public recapitalization and implicit guarantees mainly to support trading of securities. Overall, our results suggest an externality arising from fire sales in securities markets on credit supply via the trading behavior of banks.","['Puriya Abbassi', 'Rajkamal Iyer', 'José-Luis Peydró', 'Francesc R.

Evaluating the impact of unconventional monetary policy measures: Empirical evidence from the ECB׳s Securities Markets Programme,"We assess the yield impact of asset purchases within the European Central Bank׳s (ECB) Securities Markets Programme (SMP) in five euro area sovereign bond markets from 2010–11. In addition to large announcement effects, we find an impact of approximately −3 basis points at the five-year maturity for purchases of 1/1000 of the outstanding debt. Bond yield volatility and tail risk are lower on intervention days for most SMP countries. A dynamic specification points to both transitory and long-run effects. Purchases improved liquidity conditions and reduced default-risk premia, while the signaling of future low interest rates did not play a role.","['Fabian Eser', 'Bernd Schwaab']","['Central bank asset purchases', 'European Central Bank', 'Securities Markets Programme', 'Non-standard monetary policy measures', 'Yield impact']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000963,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,1,Fabian Eser,2016,169.63456538432817
Does the geographic expansion of banks reduce risk?,"We develop a new identification strategy to evaluate the impact of the geographic expansion of a bank holding company (BHC) across US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) on BHC risk. For the average BHC, the instrumental variable results suggest that geographic expansion materially reduces risk. Geographic diversification does not affect loan quality. The results are consistent with arguments that geographic expansion lowers risk by reducing exposure to idiosyncratic local risks and inconsistent with arguments that expansion, on net, increases risk by reducing the ability of BHCs to monitor loans and manage risks.","['Martin R.

Analyzing volatility risk and risk premium in option contracts: A new theory,"We develop a new option pricing framework that tightly integrates with how institutional investors manage options positions. The framework starts with the near-term dynamics of the implied volatility surface and derives no-arbitrage constraints on its current shape. Within this framework, we show that just like option implied volatilities, realized and expected volatilities can also be constructed specific to, and different across, option contracts. Applying the new theory to the S&P 500 index time series and options data, we extract volatility risk and risk premium from the volatility surfaces, and find that the extracted risk premium significantly predicts future stock returns.","['Peter Carr', 'Liuren Wu']","['Implied volatility surface', 'Option realized volatility', 'Expected volatility surface', 'Volatility risk premium', 'Vega-gamma-vanna-volga', 'Proportional variance dynamics']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000052,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,1,Peter Carr,2016,169.63456538432817
Volatility risk premia and exchange rate predictability,"We discover a new currency strategy with highly desirable return and diversification properties, which uses the predictive ability of currency volatility risk premia for currency returns. The volatility risk premium—the difference between expected realized volatility and model-free implied volatility—reflects the costs of insuring against currency volatility fluctuations. The strategy sells high insurance-cost currencies and buys low insurance-cost currencies. A distinctive feature of the strategy’s returns is that they are mainly generated by movements in spot exchange rates instead of interest rate differentials. We explore explanations for the profitability of the strategy, which cannot be understood using traditional risk factors.","['Pasquale Della Corte', 'Tarun Ramadorai', 'Lucio Sarno']","['Exchange rates', 'Volatility risk premium', 'Predictability', 'Efficient currency portfolios']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300150,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,1,Pasquale Della Corte,2016,169.63456538432817
"Adverse selection, slow-moving capital, and misallocation","We embed adverse selection into a dynamic, general equilibrium model with heterogeneous capital and study its implications for aggregate dynamics. The friction leads to delays in firms’ divestment decisions and thus slow recoveries from shocks, even when these shocks do not affect the economy’s potential output. The impediments to reallocation increase with the dispersion in productivity and decrease with the interest rate, the frequency of sectoral shocks, and households’ consumption smoothing motives. When households are risk averse, delaying reallocation serves as a hedge against future shocks, which can lead to persistent misallocation. Our model also provides a micro-foundation for convex adjustment costs and a link between the nature of these costs and the underlying economic environment.","['William Fuchs', 'Brett Green', 'Dimitris Papanikolaou']","['Misallocation', 'Adverse selection', 'General equilibrium', 'Convex adjustment costs']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000027,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,120,2,William Fuchs,2016,169.63456538432817
The real effects of share repurchases,"We employ a regression discontinuity design to identify the real effects of share repurchases on other firm outcomes. The probability of share repurchases that increase earnings per share (EPS) is sharply higher for firms that would have just missed the EPS forecast in the absence of the repurchase, when compared with firms that “just beat” the EPS forecast. We use this discontinuity to show that EPS-motivated repurchases are associated with reductions in employment and investment, and a decrease in cash holdings. Our evidence suggests that managers are willing to trade off investments and employment for stock repurchases that allow them to meet analyst EPS forecasts.","['Heitor Almeida', 'Vyacheslav Fos', 'Mathias Kronlund']","['Share repurchases', 'Employment', 'Investment', 'Regression discontinuity']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001476,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,1,Heitor Almeida,2016,169.63456538432817
Corporate governance and risk management at unprotected banks: National banks in the 1890s,"We examine bank governance and risk choices from the 1890s, a period without distortions from deposit insurance or other government assistance to banks. We link differences in managerial ownership to different corporate governance policies, risk, and methods of risk management. Formal corporate governance and high manager ownership are negatively correlated. Managerial salaries and self-lending are greater when managerial ownership is higher and lower when formal governance is employed. Banks with high managerial ownership (low formal governance) target lower default risk. High managerial ownership, not formal governance, is associated with greater reliance on cash instead of equity to limit risk.","['Charles W.

How costly is corporate bankruptcy for the CEO?,"We examine chief executive officer (CEO) career and compensation changes for large firms filing for Chapter 11. One-third of the incumbent CEOs maintain executive employment, and these CEOs experience a median compensation change of zero. However, incumbent CEOs leaving the executive labor market suffer a compensation loss with a median present value until age 65 of $7 million (five times pre-departure compensation). The likelihood of leaving decreases with profitability and CEO share ownership. Furthermore, creditor control rights during bankruptcy (through debtor-in-possession financing and large trade credits) are associated with CEO career change. Despite large equity losses (median $11 million for incumbents who stay until filing), the median incumbent does not reduce his stock ownership as the firm approaches bankruptcy.","['B.

Institutional investors and stock return anomalies,"We examine institutional demand prior to well-known stock return anomalies and find that institutions have a strong tendency to buy stocks classified as overvalued (short leg of anomaly), and that these stocks have particularly negative ex post abnormal returns. Our results differ from numerous studies documenting a positive relation between institutional demand and future returns. We trace the difference to measurement horizon. We too find a positive relation at a quarterly horizon. However, the relation turns strongly negative at the one-year horizon used in anomaly studies. We consider several explanations for institutions’ tendency to trade contrary to anomaly prescriptions. Our evidence largely rules out explanations based on flow and limits-of-arbitrage, but is more consistent with agency-induced preferences for stock characteristics that relate to poor long-run performance.","['Roger M.

Shorting at close range: A tale of two types,"We examine returns, order flow, and market conditions in the minutes before, during, and after NYSE and Nasdaq short sales. We find two distinct types of short sales: those that provide liquidity, and those that demand it. Liquidity-supplying shorts are strongly contrarian at intraday horizons. They trade when spreads are unusually wide, facing greater adverse selection. Liquidity-demanding shorts trade when spreads are narrow and tend to follow short-term price declines. These results support a competitive rational expectations model where both market-makers and informed traders short, indicating that these two shorting types are integral to both price discovery and liquidity provision.","['Carole Comerton-Forde', 'Charles M.

Executive signing bonuses are sizable and increasing in use, and they are labeled by the media as “golden hellos.” We find that executive signing bonuses are mainly awarded at firms with greater information asymmetry and higher innate risks, especially to younger executives, to mitigate the executives’ concerns about termination risk. When termination concerns are strong, signing bonus awards are associated with better performance and retention outcomes.","['Jin Xu', 'Jun Yang']","['Executive compensation', 'Signing bonus', 'Termination risk', 'Incentive device']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301052,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,1,Jin Xu,2016,169.63456538432817

Executive overconfidence and compensation structure,"We examine the impact of overconfidence on compensation structure. Our findings support the exploitation hypothesis: firms offer incentive-heavy compensation contracts to overconfident Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) to exploit their positively biased views of firm prospects. Overconfident CEOs receive more option-intensive compensation and this relation increases with CEO bargaining power. Exogenous shocks (Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 123R) provide additional support for the findings. Overconfident non-CEO executives also receive more incentive-based pay, independent of CEO overconfidence, buttressing the notion that firms tailor compensation contracts to individual behavioral traits such as overconfidence.","['Mark Humphery-Jenner', 'Ling Lei Lisic', 'Vikram Nanda', 'Sabatino Dino Silveri']","['Overconfidence', 'Compensation structure', 'Incentive compensation']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000283,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,3,Mark Humphery-Jenner,2016,169.63456538432817

We use the fraction of peers with greater managerial ability scores (Demerjian, Lev, and McVay, 2012) than the reporting firm to measure this CEO's relative peer quality (RPQ). We find that firms with higher RPQ earn higher stock returns and experience higher profitability growth than firms with lower RPQ. Learning among peers and the increased incentive to work harder induced by the peer-based tournament contribute to RPQ's performance effect.","['Bill Francis', 'Iftekhar Hasan', 'Sureshbabu Mani', 'Pengfei Ye']","['Relative peer quality', 'Firm performance', 'Tournament', 'Optimal contract']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301064,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,1,Bill Francis,2016,169.63456538432817
The product market effects of hedge fund activism,"We examine the product market spillover effects of hedge fund activism (HFA) on the industry rivals of target firms. HFA has negative real and stockholder wealth effects on the average rival firm. The effects on rivals' product market performance is commensurate with post-activism improvements in target's productivity, cost and capital allocation efficiency, and product differentiation. Financially constrained rivals accommodate these improvements but those facing high intervention threat respond effectively to them. The spillover effects are strengthened in less concentrated and low entry barrier industries.

Indexing and active fund management: International evidence,"We examine the relation between indexing and active management in the mutual fund industry worldwide. Explicit indexing and closet indexing by active funds are associated with countries’ regulatory and financial market environments. We find that actively managed funds are more active and charge lower fees when they face more competitive pressure from low-cost explicitly indexed funds. A quasi-natural experiment using the exogenous variation in indexed funds generated by the passage of pension laws supports a causal interpretation of the results. Moreover, the average alpha generated by active management is higher in countries with more explicit indexing and lower in countries with more closet indexing. Overall, our evidence suggests that explicit indexing improves competition in the mutual fund industry.","['Martijn Cremers', 'Miguel A.

Capital structure effects on the prices of equity call options,"We examine whether values of equity options traded on individual firms are sensitive to the firm’s capital structure. We estimate the compound option (CO) model, which views equity as an option on the firm. Compared with the Black-Scholes model, the CO model with a term structure of volatility (TSV) reduces pricing errors by 20% on average. The compound option effect is particularly strong for highly levered firms and long-term options, in which the pricing improvement is up to 70% of the Black-Scholes error. Without a TSV, the CO model reduces pricing errors of in-the-money options by 12.74% on average and for out-of-the-money by 9.22%. We show that the CO model implies a market value of firm leverage and allows imputation of the firm’s implied volatility, both of which have potential applications in corporate finance.","['Robert Geske', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam', 'Yi Zhou']","['Derivatives', 'Options', 'Leverage', 'Stochastic volatility']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300484,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,121,2,Robert Geske,2016,169.63456538432817
Should we be afraid of the dark? Dark trading and market quality,"We exploit a unique natural experiment—recent restrictions of dark trading in Canada and Australia—and proprietary trade-level data to analyze the effects of dark trading. Disaggregating two types of dark trading, we find that dark limit order markets are beneficial to market quality, reducing quoted, effective, and realized spreads and increasing informational efficiency. In contrast, we do not find consistent evidence that dark midpoint crossing systems significantly affect market quality.

"Limited attention, marital events and hedge funds","We explore the impact of limited attention by analyzing the performance of hedge fund managers who are distracted by marital events. We find that marriages and divorces are associated with significantly lower fund alpha, during the six-month period surrounding and the two-year period after the event. Busy managers who manage multiple funds and who are not part of a team are more affected by marital transitions. Inattentive managers place fewer active bets relative to their style peers, load more on index stocks, exhibit higher R-squareds with respect to systematic factors, and are more prone to the disposition effect.","['Yan Lu', 'Sugata Ray', 'Melvyn Teo']","['Hedge funds', 'Limited attention', 'Marriage', 'Divorce', 'Disposition effect']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301556,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,3,Yan Lu,2016,169.63456538432817
Nominal price illusion,"We explore the psychology of stock price levels and provide evidence that investors suffer from a nominal price illusion in which they overestimate the room to grow for low-priced stocks relative to high-priced stocks. While it has become increasingly clear that nominal price levels influence investor behavior, why prices matter to investors is a question that as of yet has gone unanswered. We find widespread evidence that investors systematically overestimate the skewness of low-priced stocks. In the broad cross-section of stocks, we find that investors substantially overweight the importance of price when forming skewness expectations. Asset pricing implications of our findings are borne out in the options market. A zero-cost option portfolio strategy that exploits investor overestimation of skewness for low-priced stocks generates significant abnormal returns. Finally, investor expectations of future skewness increase drastically on days that a stock undergoes a split to a lower nominal price. Empirically, however, future physical skewness decreases following splits.","['Justin Birru', 'Baolian Wang']","['Nominal price', 'Skewness', 'Stock splits', 'Options', 'Behavioral finance']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16000349,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,3,Justin Birru,2016,169.63456538432817
"Liquidity, resiliency and market quality around predictable trades: Theory and evidence","We extend the theory of strategic trading around a predictable liquidation by considering the role of market resiliency. Our model predicts that even a monopolist strategic trader improves market quality and increases liquidator proceeds if trades’ temporary price impacts are quickly reversed, and that competition among strategic traders strictly improves market quality. We provide related empirical evidence by studying prices, liquidity, and individual account trading activity around the large and predictable “roll” trades undertaken by a large exchange-traded fund (ETF). The evidence indicates narrower bid-ask spreads, greater order book depth, and improved resiliency on roll dates. We find that a larger number of individual trading accounts provide liquidity on roll dates, and do not find evidence of the systematic use of predatory strategies. On balance, the theory and evidence imply that traders supply liquidity to rather than exploit predictable trades in resilient markets.","['Hendrik Bessembinder', 'Allen Carrion', 'Laura Tuttle', 'Kumar Venkataraman']","['Predatory trading', 'Sunshine trading', 'Resiliency', 'ETFs', 'Trading costs', 'Commodity trading']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300113,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,121,1,Hendrik Bessembinder,2016,169.63456538432817
Does rating analyst subjectivity affect corporate debt pricing?,"We find evidence of systematic optimism and pessimism among credit analysts, comparing contemporaneous ratings of the same firm across rating agencies. These differences in perspectives carry through to debt prices and negatively predict future changes in credit spreads, consistent with mispricing. Moreover, the pricing effects are the largest among firms that are the most opaque, likely exacerbating financing constraints. We find that masters of business administration (MBAs) provide higher quality ratings. However, optimism increases and accuracy decreases with tenure covering the firm.

However, we reject the null hypothesis that they are identical and find that their difference is strongly related to measures of the financial standing of intermediaries.

Roughing up beta: Continuous versus discontinuous betas and the cross section of expected stock returns,"We investigate how individual equity prices respond to continuous and jumpy market price moves and how these different market price risks, or betas, are priced in the cross section of expected stock returns. Based on a novel high-frequency data set of almost 1,000 stocks over two decades, we find that the two rough betas associated with intraday discontinuous and overnight returns entail significant risk premiums, while the intraday continuous beta does not.

This homophily reduces the probability of investment success, and the detrimental effect is most prominent for early-stage investments. A variety of tests show that the cost of affinity is most likely attributable to poor decision-making by high-affinity syndicates after the investment is made.

Moreover, the more lottery-like the underlying stocks, the further and more frequently the options deviate from the put–call parity in the direction induced by overvalued calls. Furthermore, the lottery-like characteristic effect is stronger during periods of high investor sentiment.

We find significant differences between the properties of equity and asset volatilities with implications for several important areas of finance. First, financial leverage has a large influence on equity volatility. Second, leverage and asset volatility have permanent and transitory effects, respectively, on equity volatility, helping explain the short- and long-run dynamics of equity volatility.

Why do firms use high discount rates?,"We present evidence consistent with operational constraints leading firms to use high discount rates that average twice the firms’ cost of financial capital. Based on a survey of Chief Financial Officers matched to archival data, we find that firms with abundant access to capital but limited qualified management or manpower appear to forgo profitable projects in preparation for more profitable future investment opportunities. Consistent with this explanation, firms that use high discount rates have strong balance sheets, low leverage, and large cash holdings. In addition, firms appear to increase discount rates to account for idiosyncratic risk.","['Ravi Jagannathan', 'David A.

Assessing asset pricing models using revealed preference,"We propose a new method of testing asset pricing models that relies on quantities rather than just prices or returns. We use the capital flows into and out of mutual funds to infer which risk model investors use. We derive a simple test statistic that allows us to infer, from a set of candidate models, the risk model that is closest to the model that investors use in making their capital allocation decisions. Using our method, we assess the performance of the most commonly used asset pricing models in the literature.","['Jonathan B.

Have we solved the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle?,"We propose a simple methodology to evaluate a large number of potential explanations for the negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and subsequent stock returns (the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle). Surprisingly, we find that many existing explanations explain less than 10% of the puzzle. On the other hand, explanations based on investors’ lottery preferences and market frictions show some promise in explaining the puzzle. Together, all existing explanations account for 29–54% of the puzzle in individual stocks and 78–84% of the puzzle in idiosyncratic volatility-sorted portfolios. Our methodology can be applied to evaluate competing explanations for other asset pricing anomalies.","['Kewei Hou', 'Roger K.

"Reading the tea leaves: Model uncertainty, robust forecasts, and the autocorrelation of analysts’ forecast errors","We put forward a model in which analysts are uncertain about a firm’s earnings process. Faced with the possibility of using a misspecified model, analysts issue forecasts that are robust to model misspecification. We estimate that this mechanism explains approximately 60% of the autocorrelation in analysts’ forecast errors. The remainder stems from the cross-sectional variation in mean forecast errors and in analysts’ estimation errors of the persistence of earnings growth shocks. Consistent with our model, we find that analysts learn about some features of the earnings process but not others, and this learning reduces, but does not eliminate, the autocorrelation of forecast errors as firms age. Other potential explanations for the autocorrelation of analyst forecast errors are rejected. Our model of robust forecasting applies not only to analysts’ forecasts but also to all model-based forecasts.","['Juhani T.

Are Friday announcements special? Overcoming selection bias,"We report reduced market response to Friday announcements of dividend changes, seasoned equity offerings, share repurchases, earnings, and mergers, which is seemingly consistent with the notion of investor inattention on Fridays. However, we show that these findings are an outcome of selection bias. Firms that make announcements on Fridays experience reduced market response on any weekday and have common unobserved characteristics across announcement types. After correcting for selection bias, there is no evidence that investors pay less attention to announcements made on Fridays. The method introduced here is applicable to other studies in which an exogenous factor influencing firm performance can actually be associated with firm characteristics.","['Roni Michaely', 'Amir Rubin', 'Alexander Vedrashko']","['Inattention', 'Friday', 'Selection bias', 'Corporate announcements', 'Market reaction']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300976,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,122,1,Roni Michaely,2016,169.63456538432817
The common factor in idiosyncratic volatility: Quantitative asset pricing implications,"We show that firms׳ idiosyncratic volatility obeys a strong factor structure and that shocks to the common idiosyncratic volatility (CIV) factor are priced. Stocks in the lowest CIV-beta quintile earn average returns 5.4% per year higher than those in the highest quintile. The CIV factor helps to explain a number of asset pricing anomalies. We provide new evidence linking the CIV factor to income risk faced by households. Our findings are consistent with an incomplete markets heterogeneous agent model. In the model, CIV is a priced state variable because an increase in idiosyncratic firm volatility raises the average household׳s marginal utility. The calibrated model matches the high degree of co-movement in idiosyncratic volatilities, the CIV-beta return spread, and several other asset price moments.","['Bernard Herskovic', 'Bryan Kelly', 'Hanno Lustig', 'Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh']","['Firm volatility', 'Idiosyncratic risk', 'Cross section of stock returns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001774,Journal of Financial Economics,0.9067184710198053,119,2,Bernard Herskovic,2016,169.63456538432817
Short interest and aggregate stock returns,"We show that short interest is arguably the strongest known predictor of aggregate stock returns. It outperforms a host of popular return predictors both in and out of sample, with annual R2 statistics of 12.89% and 13.24%, respectively. In addition, short interest can generate utility gains of over 300 basis points per annum for a mean-variance investor. A vector autoregression decomposition shows that the economic source of short interest’s predictive power stems predominantly from a cash flow channel.

"Cyclicality, performance measurement, and cash flow liquidity in private equity","We study the liquidity properties of private equity cash flows using data from 837 buyout and venture capital funds from 1984 to 2010. Most cash flow variation at a point in time is diversifiable — either idiosyncratic to a given fund or explained by the fund’s age. Both capital calls and distributions also have a procyclical systematic component. Distributions are more sensitive than calls, implying procyclical aggregate net cash flows. A consequence is that the well-known finding that funds raised in hot markets underperform in absolute terms is sharply attenuated when comparing to public equities. Consistent with a liquidity premium for calling capital in bad times, we find that funds with a relatively high propensity to do so perform better in both absolute and relative terms. Venture capital cash flows and performance are considerably more cyclical than buyout, and the links between cyclical cash flows and performance are likewise stronger.","['David T.

Heuristic portfolio trading rules with capital gain taxes,"We study the out-of-sample performance of portfolio trading strategies used when an investor faces capital gain taxation and proportional transaction costs. Overlaying simple tax trading heuristics on trading strategies improves out-of-sample performance. For medium to large transaction costs, no trading strategy can outperform a 1/N trading strategy augmented with a tax heuristic, not even the most tax and transaction cost-efficient buy-and-hold strategy. Overall, the best strategy is 1/N augmented with a heuristic that allows for a fixed deviation in absolute portfolio weights.

Investors rely primarily on internal rates of return and multiples to evaluate investments. Their limited partners focus more on absolute performance as opposed to risk-adjusted returns. Capital structure choice is based equally on optimal trade-off and market timing considerations. PE investors anticipate adding value to portfolio companies, with a greater focus on increasing growth than on reducing costs. We also explore how the actions that PE managers say they take group into specific firm strategies and how those strategies are related to firm founder characteristics.","['Paul Gompers', 'Steven N.

In a representative US household survey, we measure ambiguity preferences using custom-designed questions based on Ellsberg urns. As theory predicts, ambiguity aversion is negatively associated with stock market participation, the fraction of financial assets in stocks, and foreign stock ownership, but it is positively related to own-company stock ownership. Conditional on stock ownership, ambiguity aversion is related to portfolio under-diversification, and during the financial crisis, ambiguity-averse respondents were more likely to sell stocks.","['Stephen G.

Purchases of calls that open new positions are the strongest predictor of returns, followed by call sales that close out existing purchased call positions.

"Disagreement, speculation, and aggregate investment","When investors disagree, speculation between them alters equilibrium prices in financial markets. Because managers maximize firm value given financial market prices, disagreement alters firms' value-maximizing investment policies. Disagreement therefore impacts aggregate investment, consumption, and output. In a production economy with recursive preferences and disasters, we demonstrate that static disagreement among investors generates dynamic aggregate investment that is positively correlated with capital shocks, leading to stochastic volatility in aggregate consumption, investment, and equity returns. The direction of these effects is consistent with business cycle facts, and with several features of the 2008 financial crisis.","['Steven D.

The model׳s performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.","['Eugene F.

Information reliability and welfare: A theory of coarse credit ratings,"An enduring puzzle is why credit rating agencies (CRAs) use a few categories to describe credit qualities lying in a continuum, even when ratings coarseness reduces welfare.

The CRA wishes to inflate ratings but prefers an unbiased rating to one whose inflation exceeds a threshold. Ratings coarseness arises in equilibrium to preclude excessive rating inflation.

Search-based peer firms: Aggregating investor perceptions through internet co-searches,"Applying a “co-search” algorithm to Internet traffic at the SEC׳s EDGAR website, we develop a novel method for identifying economically related peer firms and for measuring their relative importance.

In direct tests, SBPs dominate GICS6 industry peers in explaining cross-sectional variations in base firms׳ out-of-sample: (a) stock returns, (b) valuation multiples, (c) growth rates, (d) R&D expenditures, (e) leverage, and (f) profitability ratios. We show that SBPs are not constrained by standard industry classification, and are more dynamic, pliable, and concentrated. We also show that co-search intensity captures the degree of similarity between firms.

Do analysts matter for governance? Evidence from natural experiments,"Building on two sources of exogenous shocks to analyst coverage (broker closures and mergers), we explore the causal effects of analyst coverage on mitigating managerial expropriation of outside shareholders. We find that as a firm experiences an exogenous decrease in analyst coverage, shareholders value internal cash holdings less, its CEO receives higher excess compensation, its management is more likely to make value-destroying acquisitions, and its managers are more likely to engage in earnings management activities. Importantly, we find that most of these effects are mainly driven by the firms with smaller initial analyst coverage and less product market competition. We further find that after exogenous brokerage exits, a CEO׳s total and excess compensation become less sensitive to firm performance in firms with low initial analyst coverage. These findings are consistent with the monitoring hypothesis, specifically that financial analysts play an important governance role in scrutinizing management behavior, and the market is pricing an increase in expected agency problems after the loss in analyst coverage.","['Tao Chen', 'Jarrad Harford', 'Chen Lin']","['Financial analysts', 'Monitoring', 'Cash holdings', 'CEO compensation', 'Acquisitions']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002116,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,2,Tao Chen,2015,169.55042125467324
Monetary policy and long-term real rates,"Changes in monetary policy have surprisingly strong effects on forward real rates in the distant future. A 100 basis point increase in the two-year nominal yield on a Federal Open Markets Committee announcement day is associated with a 42 basis point increase in the ten-year forward real rate. This finding is at odds with standard macro-models based on sticky nominal prices, which imply that monetary policy cannot move real rates over a horizon longer than that over which all prices in the economy can readjust. Instead, the responsiveness of long-term real rates to monetary shocks appears to reflect changes in term premia. One mechanism that could generate such variation in term premia is based on demand effects due to the existence of what we call yield-oriented investors. We find some evidence supportive of this channel.","['Samuel G. Hanson', 'Jeremy C.

However, some statistical issues arise that their approach leaves unresolved, with implications for the option pricing results.

Culture and R2,"Consistent with predictions from the psychology literature, we find that stock prices co-move more (less) in culturally tight (loose) and collectivistic (individualistic) countries.

Both market-wide and firm-specific variations are lower in tighter cultures. Individualism is mostly associated with higher firm-specific variations. Trade and financial openness weakens the effect of domestic culture on stock price comovements. These results hold for various robustness checks.

Good and bad uncertainty: Macroeconomic and financial market implications,"Does macroeconomic uncertainty increase or decrease aggregate growth and asset prices? To address this question, we decompose aggregate uncertainty into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ volatility components, associated with positive and negative innovations to macroeconomic growth. We document that in line with our theoretical framework, these two uncertainties have opposite impact on aggregate growth and asset prices. Good uncertainty predicts an increase in future economic activity, such as consumption, output, and investment, and is positively related to valuation ratios, while bad uncertainty forecasts a decline in economic growth and depresses asset prices. Further, the market price of risk and equity beta of good uncertainty are positive, while negative for bad uncertainty. Hence, both uncertainty risks contribute positively to risk premia, and help explain the cross-section of expected returns beyond cash flow risk.","['Gill Segal', 'Ivan Shaliastovich', 'Amir Yaron']","['Uncertainty', 'Economic growth', 'Asset prices', 'Recursive utility']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000756,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,2,Gill Segal,2015,169.55042125467324
Costs and benefits of friendly boards during mergers and acquisitions,"Finance theory predicts that board independence is not always in the shareholders׳ interest. in situations in which board advice is more important than monitoring, independence can decrease firm value. I test this prediction by examining the connection between takeover returns and board friendliness, using social ties between the CEO and board members as a proxy for less independent boards.

Maturity rationing and collective short-termism,"Financing terms and investment decisions are jointly determined. This interdependence, which links firms׳ asset and liability sides, can lead to short-termism in investment. In our model, financing frictions increase with the investment horizon, such that financing for long-term projects is relatively expensive and potentially rationed. In response, firms whose first-best investments are long-term may adopt second-best projects of shorter maturities. This worsens financing terms for firms with shorter-maturity projects, inducing them to change their investments as well. In equilibrium, investment is inefficiently short-term. Equilibrium asset-side adjustments by firms can amplify shocks and, while privately optimal, can be socially undesirable.","['Konstantin Milbradt', 'Martin Oehmke']","['Short-termism', 'Asset maturity', 'Credit rationing', 'Asymmetric information', 'Cross-firm externality']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001846,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,3,Konstantin Milbradt,2015,169.55042125467324

Persistence continues under different chief executive officers (CEOs), and attributes of the broader management team do not explain the fixed effect.

We show that closer ties to multinationals lead to improved transparency of wage reporting in private Russian companies. Employees located closest to movers from multinationals in the job quality space experience the largest gains in transparency. We find a robust correlation between wage misreporting and accounting fraud.,"['Serguey Braguinsky', 'Sergey Mityakov']","['Culture', 'Transparency', 'Foreign corporations', 'Diffusion', 'Foreign direct investment']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000597,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,1,Serguey Braguinsky,2015,169.55042125467324
Price support by bank-affiliated mutual funds,"Fund managers are double agents; they serve both fund investors and owners of management firms. This conflict of interest may result in trading to support securities prices. Tests of this hypothesis in the Spanish mutual fund industry indicate that bank-affiliated mutual funds systematically increase their holdings in the controlling bank stock around seasoned equity issues, at the time of bad news about the controlling bank, before anticipated price drops, and after non-anticipated price drops. The results seem mainly driven by bank managers׳ incentives. Ownership of asset management companies thus matters and can distort capital allocation and asset prices.","['Benjamin Golez', 'Jose M.

Deflating profitability,"Gross profit scaled by book value of total assets predicts the cross section of average returns. Novy-Marx (2013) concludes that it outperforms other measures of profitability such as bottom line net income, cash flows, and dividends. One potential explanation for the measure׳s predictive ability is that its numerator (gross profit) is a cleaner measure of economic profitability. An alternative explanation lies in the measure׳s deflator. We find that net income equals gross profit in predictive power when they have consistent deflators. Deflating profit by the book value of total assets results in a variable that is the product of profitability and the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of total assets, which is priced. We then construct an alternative measure of profitability, operating profitability, which better matches current expenses with current revenue. This measure exhibits a far stronger link with expected returns than either net income or gross profit. It predicts returns as far as ten years ahead, seemingly inconsistent with irrational pricing explanations.","['Ray Ball', 'Joseph Gerakos', 'Juhani T. Linnainmaa', 'Valeri V.

Equilibrium fast trading,"High speed market connections improve investors׳ ability to search for attractive quotes in fragmented markets, raising gains from trade. They also enable fast traders to obtain information before slow traders, generating adverse selection, and thus negative externalities. When investing in fast trading technologies, institutions do not internalize these externalities. Accordingly, they overinvest in equilibrium. Completely banning fast trading is dominated by offering two types of markets: one accepting fast traders, the other banning them. Utilitarian welfare is maximized with (i) a single market type on which fast and slow traders coexist and (ii) Pigovian taxes on investment in the fast trading technology.","['Bruno Biais', 'Thierry Foucault', 'Sophie Moinas']","['High-frequency trading', 'Externalities', 'Welfare']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000288,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,2,Bruno Biais,2015,169.55042125467324
Deposits and bank capital structure,"In a model with bankruptcy costs and segmented deposit and equity markets, we endogenize the cost of equity and deposit finance for banks. Despite risk neutrality, equity capital earns a higher expected return than direct investment in risky assets. Banks hold positive capital to reduce bankruptcy costs, but there is a role for capital regulation when deposits are insured. Banks could no longer use capital when they lend to firms instead of investing directly in risky assets. This depends on whether the firms are public and compete with banks for equity capital or are private with exogenous amounts of capital.","['Franklin Allen', 'Elena Carletti', 'Robert Marquez']","['Deposit finance', 'Bankruptcy costs', 'Regulation']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002499,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,3,Franklin Allen,2015,169.55042125467324
Volatility and mutual fund manager skill,"In a standard four-factor framework, mutual fund return volatility is a reliable, persistent, and powerful predictor of future abnormal returns. However, the abnormal returns are eliminated by the addition of a “vol” anomaly factor contrasting returns on portfolios of low and high volatility stocks. Consistent with Novy-Marx (2014) and Fama and French (2014), the Fama and French (2015) profitability and investment factors are equally effective at eliminating the abnormal returns.

The JOBS Act and IPO volume: Evidence that disclosure costs affect the IPO decision,"In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) was enacted to help revitalize the initial public offering (IPO) market, especially for small firms. During the year ending March 2014, IPO volume and the proportion of small firm issuers was the largest since 2000. Controlling for market conditions, we estimate that the JOBS Act has led to 21 additional IPOs annually, a 25% increase over pre-JOBS levels. Firms with high proprietary disclosure costs, such as biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms, increase IPO activity the most. These firms are also more likely to take advantage of the act׳s de-risking provisions, allowing firms to file the IPO confidentially while testing-the-waters.","['Michael Dambra', 'Laura Casares Field', 'Matthew T.

Asymmetric decrease in liquidity trading before earnings announcements and the announcement return premium,"Investors are reluctant to trade in the high-information-asymmetry days before earnings announcements. We show that the decrease in liquidity trading before announcements is asymmetric. We analyze buy and sell orders of investors with passive investment strategies, and find they do not reduce their sales as much as their purchases in the days before announcements. Investors needing liquidity sell stocks at a discount relative to the post-announcement price, and these preannouncement liquidity sales are a significant driver of the average positive returns, or return premium, known to characterize announcement days.","['Shai Levi', 'Xiao-Jun Zhang']","['Earnings announcement premium', 'Liquidity']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001427,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,2,Shai Levi,2015,169.55042125467324
"Liquid-claim production, risk management, and bank capital structure: Why high leverage is optimal for banks","Liquidity production is a central function of banks. High leverage is optimal for banks in a model that has just enough frictions for banks to have a meaningful role in liquid-claim production. The model has a market premium for (socially valuable) safe/liquid debt, but no taxes or other traditional motives to lever up. Because only safe debt commands a liquidity premium, banks with risky assets use risk management to maximize their capacity to include such debt in the capital structure. The model can explain why banks have higher leverage than most operating firms, why risk management is central to banks׳ operating policies, why bank leverage increased over the last 150 years or so, and why leverage limits for regulated banks impede their ability to compete with unregulated shadow banks.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'René M.

Can managers time the market? Evidence using repurchase price data,"Little is known about the price firms pay for stock repurchases. Using a data set of all U.S. repurchases from 2004 to 2011, we compare the actual average price paid monthly in a repurchase with the average market price for the same stock over various horizons. We find that firms repurchase stock at a significantly lower price than the average market price in all sample years. Less frequent repurchasers, firms that repurchase when insiders buy on their own account, and firms that experience low stock returns prior to the repurchase obtain significantly lower prices. After controlling for risk factors, repurchasing firms earn positive returns. Infrequent repurchasers earn a significantly higher return up to three years following the actual repurchase.","['Amy Dittmar', 'Laura Casares Field']","['Repurchases', 'Market timing']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001913,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,2,Amy Dittmar,2015,169.55042125467324

Commonality in news around the world,"Motivated by the pioneering study of Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000), this paper investigates whether and how news commonality varies according to a country׳s institutional environments. Using a unique global news data set across 41 countries for the 2000–2009 period, we document three notable findings. First, firm-level news comoves more in countries with weaker institutional environments than in those with stronger institutional environments. Second, news commonality is positively associated with both stock return comovement and stock liquidity commonality. Third, the effect of news commonality on stock return and liquidity comovement is higher in countries with stronger institutions than in those with weaker institutions. These results suggest that a country׳s institutional environments affect firm-specific information production and, more importantly, support the information-efficiency view that lower price synchronicity is caused by greater capitalization of firm-specific information.","['Tung Lam Dang', 'Fariborz Moshirian', 'Bohui Zhang']","['News commonality', 'Information production', 'Institutional environments', 'Stock return comovement', 'Stock liquidity commonality']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002530,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,1,Tung Lam Dang,2015,169.55042125467324
Wealth transfers via equity transactions,"Previous research indicates that firms issue shares when their stock is overpriced and repurchase shares when their stock is underpriced. Such transactions transfer wealth from transacting stockholders to ongoing stockholders. We quantify the magnitude of these wealth transfers and analyze their implications. Strikingly, we find that for the average firm-year, these wealth transfers approximate 40% of net income. We also find that these wealth transfers can be predicted using a variety of firm characteristics and that future wealth transfers are an important determinant of current stock prices.","['Richard G.

The adverse effects of systematic leakage ahead of official sovereign debt rating announcements,"Rating agencies consult with local government officials several days prior to official announcements of sovereign debt rating changes, making information leakage likely. Using cross-country data from 1988 to 2012, we find evidence of information leakage. In particular, we find statistically and economically significant negative daily abnormal stock index returns prior to downgrade announcements. These effects are more pronounced in countries with lower institutional quality, and they persist during times with no downgrade rumors and no concurrent bad news in general. A mild post-announcement reversal consistent with overreaction to pre-event downgrade rumors highlights the adverse effects of such leakage and, thus, should be a policy concern for capital market regulators.","['Alexander Michaelides', 'Andreas Milidonis', 'George P.

Dark trading and price discovery,"Regulators globally are concerned that dark trading harms price discovery. We show that dark trades are less informed than lit trades. High levels of dark trading increase adverse selection risk on the lit exchange by increasing the concentration of informed traders. Using both high- and low-frequency measures of informational efficiency we find that low levels of non-block dark trading are benign or even beneficial for informational efficiency, but high levels are harmful. In contrast, we find no evidence that block trades in the dark impede price discovery.","['Carole Comerton-Forde', 'Tālis J.

Juicing the dividend yield: Mutual funds and the demand for dividends,"Some mutual funds purchase stocks before dividend payments to artificially increase their dividends, which we call “juicing.” Funds paid more than twice the dividends implied by their holdings in 7.4% of fund-years examined. Juicing is associated with larger inflows, and is more common among funds with unsophisticated investors. This behavior is consistent with an underlying investor demand for dividends, but is hard to explain by taxes or need for income, as funds can generate equivalent tax-free distributions by returning capital. Juicing is costly to investors through higher turnover and increased taxes of 0.57% to 1.52% of fund assets per year.","['Lawrence E. Harris', 'Samuel M. Hartzmark', 'David H.

"The failure of models that predict failure: Distance, incentives, and defaults","Statistical default models, widely used to assess default risk, fail to account for a change in the relations between different variables resulting from an underlying change in agent behavior. We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997–2006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk could, therefore, be undermined by the actions of market participants.","['Uday Rajan', 'Amit Seru', 'Vikrant Vig']","['Statistical model', 'Lucas critique', 'Mortgage default', 'Regulation']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002098,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,2,Uday Rajan,2015,169.55042125467324
Social interaction at work,"Stock market investment decisions of individuals are positively correlated with those of coworkers. Sorting of unobservably similar individuals to the same workplaces is unlikely to explain this pattern, as evidenced by the investment behavior of individuals who move between plants. Purchases made under stronger coworker purchase activity are not associated with higher returns. Moreover, social interaction appears to drive the purchase of within-industry stocks. Overall, we find a strong influence of coworkers on investment choices, but not an influence that improves the quality of investment decisions.","['Hans K.

Motivated monitors: The importance of institutional investors׳ portfolio weights,"Studies of institutional monitoring focus on the fraction of the firm held by institutions. We focus on the fraction of the institution׳s portfolio represented by the firm. In the context of acquisitions, we hypothesize that institutional monitoring will be greatest when the target firm represents a significant allocation of funds in the institution׳s portfolio. We show that this measure is important in reconciling mixed findings for total institutional ownership in the prior literature. The results indicate that our measure of institutional holdings leads to greater bid completion rates, higher premiums, and lower acquirer returns. This empirical evidence provides support for theories predicting a beneficial effect of blockholders in monitoring the firm in general and in enhancing the gains to takeover targets in particular.","['Eliezer M.

How do acquirers choose between mergers and tender offers?,"Tender offers provide the advantage of substantially faster completion times than mergers. However, a tender offer signals to the target higher demand for its shares and raises its reservation price. In equilibrium, bidders tradeoff speed and cost. Consistent with this theory, we show that deals in more competitive environments and deals with fewer external impediments on execution are more likely to be structured as tender offers. Tender offers also require higher premiums than mergers. Finally, the rivals of the bidding firm realize significantly lower announcement returns and subsequent operating performance in tender offers than in mergers.","['David Offenberg', 'Christo Pirinsky']","['Tender offers', 'Takeover premiums', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Termination fees', 'Arbitrage spreads']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000227,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,2,David Offenberg,2015,169.55042125467324
Fund managers under pressure: Rationale and determinants of secondary buyouts,"The fastest growing segment of private equity (PE) deals is secondary buyouts (SBOs)—sales from one PE fund to another. Using a comprehensive sample of leveraged buyouts, we investigate whether SBOs are value-maximizing, or reflect opportunistic behavior. To proxy for adverse incentives, we develop buy and sell pressure indexes based on how close PE funds are to the end of their investment period or lifetime, their unused capital, reputation, deal activity, and fundraising frequency. We report that funds under pressure engage more in SBOs. Pressured buyers pay higher multiples, use less leverage, and syndicate less suggesting that their motive is to spend equity. Pressured sellers exit at lower multiples and have shorter holding periods. When pressured counterparties meet, deal multiples depend on differential bargaining power. Moreover, funds that invested under pressure underperform.","['Sridhar Arcot', 'Zsuzsanna Fluck', 'José-Miguel Gaspar', 'Ulrich Hege']","['Leveraged buyouts', 'Secondary buyouts', 'Private equity', 'Limited investment horizon', 'Agency conflicts in fund management']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001640,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,1,Sridhar Arcot,2015,169.55042125467324
"Financial integration, housing, and economic volatility","The Great Recession illustrates the sensitivity of the economy to housing. This paper shows that financial integration, fostered by securitization and nationwide branching, amplified the positive effect of housing price shocks on the economy during the 1994–2006 period. We exploit variation in credit supply subsidies across local markets from government-sponsored enterprises to measure housing price changes unrelated to fundamentals. Using this instrument, we find that house price shocks spur economic growth. The effect is larger in localities more financially integrated, through both secondary loan market and bank branch networks.

Financing bidders in takeover contests,"This paper argues that endogenizing how acquirers finance their cash bids is just as important for understanding bidding in takeovers as endogenizing acquirers׳ payment method choice. The paper shows that acquirers finance their cash bids with equity only if they lack access to competitive financing. This leads to underbidding and lower takeover premiums. Conversely, acquirers with access to competitive financing use debt and overbid. Endogenizing the payment method reveals that security (e.g., stock) bids carry lower premiums than cash bids, backed by competitive financing.

Under a representative agent setting, we empirically evaluate alternative preference specifications including a multiple-priors recursive utility. We find that relative risk aversion is estimated around 1–8 with ambiguity aversion and 7.4–15 without ambiguity aversion. Estimated ambiguity aversion is both economically and statistically significant and can explain up to 45% of the average equity premium. The elasticity of intertemporal substitution is higher than one, but its identification appears to be weak, as observed by previous authors.","['Daehee Jeong', 'Hwagyun Kim', 'Joon Y.

Friends or foes? The interrelationship between angel and venture capital markets,"This paper develops a theory of how angel and venture capital markets interact. Entrepreneurs first receive angel then venture capital funding. The two investor types are ‘friends’ in that they rely upon each other׳s investments. However, they are also ‘foes,’ because at the later stage the venture capitalists no longer need the angels. Using a costly search model we derive the equilibrium deal flows across the two markets, endogenously deriving market sizes, competitive structures, valuation levels, and exit rates. We also examine the role of legal protection for angel investments.","['Thomas Hellmann', 'Veikko Thiele']","['Entrepreneurship', 'Angel investors', 'Venture capital', 'Start-ups', 'Search']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002311,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,3,Thomas Hellmann,2015,169.55042125467324
Generalized risk premia,"This paper develops an optimal trading strategy explicitly linked to an agent׳s preferences and assessment of the distribution of asset returns. The price of this strategy is a portfolio of implied moments, and its expected excess returns naturally accommodate compensation for higher-order moment risk. Variance risk and the equity premium approximate it to first order and it nests cross-sectional asset pricing models such as the linear Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). An empirical study in the US index market compares the investment behavior of an agent with recursive long-run risk preferences to one who merely uses an identically independently distributed time series model and takes market prices as given. The two agents exhibit very similar behavior during crises and can be distinguished mostly during calm periods.",['Paul Schneider'],"['Preference trading', 'Pricing kernel', 'Model risk', 'Trading strategy', 'Model-free', 'Variance premium', 'Equity premium', 'Skew premium', 'Kurtosis premium']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000276,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,3,Paul Schneider,2015,169.55042125467324
Political capital and moral hazard,"This paper examines how political connections affect risk exposure of financial institutions. Using a geography-based measure, I find that politically connected firms have higher leverage and their stocks have higher volatility and beta. Furthermore, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, politically-connected financial firms had higher leverage and were more likely to increase their leverage during the housing bubble in response to local growth in median housing prices. During the crisis, higher leverage was associated with worse performance but being in a state with a US Senator on the Banking Committee was correlated with weakly improved stock returns and reduced bankruptcy probability, highlighting the value of political connections for financial firms.",['Leonard Kostovetsky'],"['Moral hazard', 'Financial crisis', 'Bank leverage', 'Political connections', 'Risk taking']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002736,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,1,Leonard Kostovetsky,2015,169.55042125467324

Using a unique data set of Moscow traffic violations, I construct the PTC of every Muscovite with a driver׳s license. Next, I determine the PTC for the top management of 58,157 privately held firms. I find that a 1 standard deviation increase in management PTC corresponds to a 3.6% increase in income diversion and that firms with corrupt management significantly outperform their counterparts.

Employee rights and acquisitions,"This paper examines the outcomes and characteristics of corporate acquisitions from the perspective of stakeholder-shareholder agency conflicts. Using state variation in labor protections, we find that acquirers with strong labor rights experience lower announcement returns. Combined acquirer and target announcement returns are also lower in the presence of strong labor rights. Our findings remain statistically and economically significant after we control for a range of deal, firm, industry and state characteristics and explore various channels for the labor rights effect. Overall, the evidence indicates that employee-shareholder conflicts of interest reduce shareholder gains from acquisitions.","['Kose John', 'Anzhela Knyazeva', 'Diana Knyazeva']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Firm value', 'Employees', 'Agency conflicts']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000926,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,1,Kose John,2015,169.55042125467324
Bank loans and troubled debt restructurings,"This paper examines the relation between the number and type of lenders that participate in corporate loan facilities and the nature of troubled debt restructurings. We find that loans from traditional bank lenders are significantly easier to restructure out of court than loans from institutional lenders. We also find that the existence of a past banking relationship between the borrower and the lead arranger of a syndicated loan adversely affects the ease of restructuring. Finally, we find that reliance on loans that are held in part by collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) is positively related to the likelihood of a prepackaged bankruptcy, consistent with greater holdout problems when loans are held by CLOs. Overall, our findings suggest that the role of banks in the restructuring process is quite different when bank loans are diffusely held or securitized.","['Cem Demiroglu', 'Christopher James']","['Debt restructuring', 'Bankruptcy', 'Holdout problem', 'CLOs']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001245,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,1,Cem Demiroglu,2015,169.55042125467324
The effect of repatriation tax costs on U.S. multinational investment,"This paper investigates whether the U.S. repatriation tax for U.S. multinational corporations affects foreign investment. Our results show that the locked-out cash due to repatriation tax costs is associated with a higher likelihood of foreign (but not domestic) acquisitions. We also find a negative association between tax-induced foreign cash holdings and the market reaction to foreign deals. This result suggests that the investment activity of firms with high repatriation tax costs is viewed by the market as less value-enhancing than that of firms with low tax costs, consistent with foreign investment of firms with high repatriation tax costs possibly reflecting agency-driven behavior.","['Michelle Hanlon', 'Rebecca Lester', 'Rodrigo Verdi']","['Cash', 'Investment', 'Tax']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002748,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,1,Michelle Hanlon,2015,169.55042125467324
Macroeconomic linkages between monetary policy and the term structure of interest rates,"This paper studies the equilibrium term structure of nominal and real interest rates and the time-varying bond risk premia implied by a stochastic endogenous growth model with imperfect price adjustment and monetary policy shocks. The production and price-setting decisions of firms drive low-frequency movements in growth and inflation rates that are negatively related. With recursive preferences, these growth and inflation dynamics are crucial for rationalizing key stylized facts in bond markets. When calibrated to macroeconomic data, the model quantitatively explains the means and volatilities of nominal bond yields and the failure of the expectations hypothesis.",['Howard Kung'],"['Term structure of interest rates', 'Asset pricing', 'Recursive preferences', 'Monetary policy', 'Endogenous growth', 'Inflation', 'Productivity']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001901,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,1,Howard Kung,2015,169.55042125467324
Technology spillovers and corporate cash holdings,"This study examines the effect of technology spillovers on firms׳ cash holdings. It finds that firms facing greater technology spillovers hold higher cash balances. This effect is more pronounced among financially constrained firms and for firms that are likely to benefit more from diffused technology, e.g., those that have newer patents, are more profitable, and face better growth opportunities. The spillover impact remains strong when product market competition and own-firm innovations are accounted for. Overall, our study identifies technology spillovers as an important factor in determining corporate cash policy.","['Jiaping Qiu', 'Chi Wan']","['Technology spillovers', 'Product market competition', 'Cash holdings']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002141,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,3,Jiaping Qiu,2015,169.55042125467324
Resource accumulation through economic ties: Evidence from venture capital,"Ties between similar partners in economic and financial networks are often attributed to concerns about agency costs. In this paper, we distinguish the underlying motives for tie formation between sets of potential partners in the network, thus informing the relative importance of agency cost and resource accumulation in tie formation across firms. We develop a robust and generalizable methodology that allows for the inference of similarity and/or cumulative advantage motives in the potential presence of resource trading. We estimate the model using venture capital (VC) co-investment networks, employing factor analysis to characterize orthogonal, interpretable resources for VC firms. In the VC setting, value-added resources other than capital appear to be exchanged for capital, but not for one another. We find little evidence for similarity motives as the primary driver of matching, suggesting that concerns over agency conflicts in partnering are dominated by the desire to accumulate higher levels of certain resources.","['Yael V.

A century of capital structure: The leveraging of corporate America,"Unregulated US corporations dramatically increased their debt usage over the past century. Aggregate leverage—low and stable before 1945—more than tripled between 1945 and 1970 from 11% to 35%, eventually reaching 47% by the early 1990s. The median firm in 1946 had no debt, but by 1970 had a leverage ratio of 31%. This increase occurred in all unregulated industries and affected firms of all sizes. Changing firm characteristics are unable to account for this increase. Rather, changes in government borrowing, macroeconomic uncertainty, and financial sector development play a more prominent role. Despite this increase among unregulated firms, a combination of stable debt usage among regulated firms and a decrease in the fraction of aggregate assets held by regulated firms over this period resulted in a relatively stable economy-wide leverage ratio during the 20th century.","['John R.

Corporate goodness and shareholder wealth,"Using a unique data set, I study how stock markets react to positive and negative events concerned with a firm׳s corporate social responsibility (CSR). I show that investors respond strongly negatively to negative events and weakly negatively to positive events. I then show that investors do value “offsetting CSR,” that is positive CSR news concerning firms with a history of poor stakeholder relations. In contrast, investors respond negatively to positive CSR news which is more likely to result from agency problems. Finally, I provide evidence that CSR news with stronger legal and economic information content generates a more pronounced investor reaction.",['Philipp Krüger'],"['Corporate social responsibility', 'Corporate sustainability', 'Agency costs', 'Event study', 'Corporate governance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001925,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,2,Philipp Krüger,2015,169.55042125467324
The role of dynamic renegotiation and asymmetric information in financial contracting,"Using data from Securities and Exchange Commission filings, I show that the typical bank loan is renegotiated five times, or every nine months. The pricing, maturity, amount, and covenants are all significantly modified during each renegotiation, whose timing is governed by the financial health of the contracting parties and uncertainty regarding the borrowers’ credit quality. The relative importance of these factors depends on the duration of the lending relationship.

The price of wine,"Using historical price records for Bordeaux Premiers Crus, we examine the impact of aging on wine prices and the long-term investment performance of fine wine. In line with the predictions of an illustrative model, young maturing wines from high-quality vintages provide the highest financial returns. Past maturity, famous châteaus deliver growing non-pecuniary benefits to their owners. Using an arithmetic repeat-sales regression over 1900–2012, we estimate a real financial return to wine investment (net of storage costs) of 4.1%, which exceeds bonds, art, and stamps. Returns to wine and equities are positively correlated. Finally, we find evidence of in-sample return predictability.","['Elroy Dimson', 'Peter L.

As certain as debt and taxes: Estimating the tax sensitivity of leverage from state tax changes,"Using staggered corporate income tax changes across U.S. states, we show that taxes have a first-order effect on capital structure. Firms increase leverage by around 40 basis points for every percentage-point tax increase. Consistent with dynamic tradeoff theory, the effect is asymmetric: leverage does not respond to tax cuts. This is true even within-firm: tax increases that are later reversed nonetheless lead to permanent leverage increases. The treatment effects are heterogeneous and confirm the tax channel: tax sensitivity is greater among profitable and investment-grade firms which respectively have a greater marginal tax benefit and lower marginal cost of issuing debt.","['Florian Heider', 'Alexander Ljungqvist']","['Capital structure', 'Taxes', 'Tradeoff theory', 'Dynamic capital structure models', 'Natural experiments']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000057,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,3,Florian Heider,2015,169.55042125467324
Measuring skill in the mutual fund industry,"Using the value that a mutual fund extracts from capital markets as the measure of skill, we find that the average mutual fund has used this skill to generate about $3.2 million per year. Large cross-sectional differences in skill persist for as long as ten years. Investors recognize this skill and reward it by investing more capital with better funds. Better funds earn higher aggregate fees, and a strong positive correlation exists between current compensation and future performance. The cross-sectional distribution of managerial skill is predominantly reflected in the cross-sectional distribution of fund size, not gross alpha.","['Jonathan B.

Incremental variables and the investment opportunity set,"Variables with strong marginal explanatory power in cross-section asset pricing regressions typically show less power to produce increments to average portfolio returns, for two reasons. (1) Adding an explanatory variable can attenuate the slopes in a regression. (2) Adding a variable with marginal explanatory power always attenuates the values of other explanatory variables in the extremes of a regression’s fitted values. Without a restriction on portfolio weights, the maximum Sharpe ratios in the GRS statistic of Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989) provide little information about an incremental variable’s impact on the portfolio opportunity set.","['Eugene F.

"Debt, labor markets, and the creation and destruction of firms","We analyze the financing and liquidation decisions of firms that face a labor market with search frictions. By inducing bankruptcy, debt can facilitate the process of creative destruction (i.e., the elimination of inefficient firms and the creation of new firms) but can also lead to excessive liquidation and unemployment in particular, during economic downturns. Within this setting, we examine policy interventions that influence the firms׳ financing and liquidation choices. We consider the role of monetary policy, which can reduce debt burdens during economy-wide downturns, and tax policy, which can influence the incentives of firms to use debt financing.","['Andres Almazan', 'Adolfo de Motta', 'Sheridan Titman']","['Capital structure', 'Debt', 'Labor markets', 'Unemployment', 'Corporate taxes']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001154,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,3,Andres Almazan,2015,169.55042125467324
Impact of the Dodd-Frank act on credit ratings,"We analyze the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) on corporate bond ratings issued by credit rating agencies (CRAs). We find no evidence that Dodd-Frank disciplines CRAs to provide more accurate and informative credit ratings. Instead, following Dodd-Frank, CRAs issue lower ratings, give more false warnings, and issue downgrades that are less informative. These results are consistent with the reputation model of Morris (2001), and suggest that CRAs become more protective of their reputation following the passage of Dodd-Frank. Consistent with Morris (2001), we find that our results are stronger for industries with low Fitch market share, where Moody׳s and Standard & Poor׳s have stronger incentives to protect their reputation (Becker and Milbourn, 2011). Our results are not driven by business cycle effects or firm characteristics, and strengthen as the uncertainty regarding the passage of Dodd-Frank gets resolved. We conclude that increasing the legal and regulatory costs to CRAs might have an adverse effect on the quality of credit ratings.","['Valentin Dimitrov', 'Darius Palia', 'Leo Tang']","['Dodd-Frank', 'Reputation', 'Credit ratings', 'Information', 'Financial crisis']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002347,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,3,Valentin Dimitrov,2015,169.55042125467324
Payout policy through the financial crisis: The growth of repurchases and the resilience of dividends,"We compare the payout policies of US industrials and banks over the past 30 years to better understand dividends, especially for banks. For industrials, dividends grow strongly after 2002, when the declining propensity to pay reverses. Banks have a higher and more stable propensity to pay dividends and resist cutting dividends as the 2007–2008 financial crisis begins. Before the crisis, increases in repurchases push payouts to historic levels. These findings are broadly consistent with the idea that banks use dividends to signal financial strength while agency costs of free cash flow better explain industrial payouts.","['Eric Floyd', 'Nan Li', 'Douglas J.

Liquidity hoarding and interbank market rates: The role of counterparty risk,"We develop a model of interbank lending and borrowing with counterparty risk. The model has two key ingredients. First, liquidity in the banking sector is endogenous, so there is an opportunity cost of holding liquid assets. Second, banks are privately informed about the risk of their long-term assets, which can lead to adverse selection and high interest rates in the interbank market. We identify a novel form of a market break-down, which can lead to liquidity hoarding. It arises because adverse selection in the interbank market changes the opportunity cost of holding liquidity. We use the model to shed light on developments in interbank markets prior to and during the 2007–09 financial crisis, as well as the effectiveness of policy interventions aimed at restoring interbank market activity.","['Florian Heider', 'Marie Hoerova', 'Cornelia Holthausen']","['Interbank market', 'Endogenous liquidity', 'Counterparty risk', 'Asymmetric information', 'Market break-down', 'Financial crisis']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001233,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,2,Florian Heider,2015,169.55042125467324
Signal or noise? Uncertainty and learning about whether other traders are informed,"We develop a model where some investors are uncertain whether others are trading on informative signals or noise. Uncertainty about others leads to a nonlinear price that reacts asymmetrically to news. We incorporate this uncertainty into a dynamic setting where traders gradually learn about others and show that it generates empirically relevant return dynamics: expected returns are stochastic but predictable, and volatility exhibits clustering and the “leverage” effect. The model nests both the rational expectations (RE) and differences of opinions (DO) approaches and highlights a link between disagreement about fundamentals and uncertainty about other traders.","['Snehal Banerjee', 'Brett Green']","['Rational expectations', 'Difference of opinions', 'Sentiment', 'Volatility clustering', 'Leverage effect']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000744,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,2,Snehal Banerjee,2015,169.55042125467324
A theory of LBO activity based on repeated debt-equity conflicts,"We develop a theory of leveraged buyout (LBO) activity based on two elements: the ability of private equity-owned firms to borrow against their sponsors׳ reputation with creditors and externalities in sponsors׳ reputations due to competition and club formation. In equilibrium, the two sources of value creation in LBOs, operational improvements and financing, are complements. Moreover, sponsors that never add operational value cannot add value through financing either. Club deals are beneficial ex post by allowing low-reputation bidders with high valuations to borrow reputation from high-reputation bidders with low valuations, but they can destroy value by reducing bidders׳ investment in reputation. Unlike leverage of independent firms, driven only by firm-specific factors, buyout leverage is driven by economy-wide and sponsor-specific factors.","['Andrey Malenko', 'Nadya Malenko']","['Leveraged buyouts', 'Private equity', 'Reputation', 'Debt-equity conflicts', 'Club deals']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001002,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,3,Andrey Malenko,2015,169.55042125467324
"Corporate payout, cash retention, and the supply of credit: Evidence from the 2008–2009 credit crisis","We document significant reductions in corporate payouts-both dividends and (to a larger extent) share repurchases-during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. Payout reductions are more likely in firms with higher leverage, more valuable growth options, and lower cash balances, i.e., those more susceptible to the negative consequences of an external financing shock. Moreover, firms appear to use the proceeds from the reduction in payout to maintain cash levels and to fund investment. These findings are consistent with the view that a shock to the supply of credit (net of demand effects) during the financial crisis increased the marginal benefit of cash retention, leading some firms to turn to payout reductions as a substitute form of financing.","['Barbara A.

Scale and skill in active management,"We empirically analyze the nature of returns to scale in active mutual fund management. We find strong evidence of decreasing returns at the industry level. As the size of the active mutual fund industry increases, a fund׳s ability to outperform passive benchmarks declines. At the fund level, all methods considered indicate decreasing returns, though estimates that avoid econometric biases are insignificant. We also find that the active management industry has become more skilled over time. This upward trend in skill coincides with industry growth, which precludes the skill improvement from boosting fund performance. Finally, we find that performance deteriorates over a typical fund׳s lifetime. This result can also be explained by industry-level decreasing returns to scale.","['Ľuboš Pástor', 'Robert F.

The disintermediation of financial markets: Direct investing in private equity,"We examine 20 years of direct private equity investments by seven large institutions. These direct investments perform better than public market indices, especially buyout investments and those made in the 1990s. Outperformance by the direct investments, however, relative to the corresponding private equity fund benchmarks is limited and concentrated among buyout transactions. Co-investments underperform the corresponding funds with which they co-invest, due to an apparent adverse selection of transactions available to these investors, while solo transactions outperform fund benchmarks.

"Executives' “off-the-job” behavior, corporate culture, and financial reporting risk","We examine how executives' behavior outside the workplace, as measured by their ownership of luxury goods (low “frugality”) and prior legal infractions, is related to financial reporting risk. We predict and find that chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) with a legal record are more likely to perpetrate fraud. In contrast, we do not find a relation between executives' frugality and the propensity to perpetrate fraud. However, as predicted, we find that unfrugal CEOs oversee a relatively loose control environment characterized by relatively high and increasing probabilities of other insiders perpetrating fraud and unintentional material reporting errors during their tenure. Further, cultural changes associated with an increase in fraud risk are more likely during unfrugal (vs. frugal) CEOs' reigns, including the appointment of an unfrugal CFO, an increase in executives' equity-based incentives to misreport, and a decline in measures of board monitoring intensity.","['Robert Davidson', 'Aiyesha Dey', 'Abbie Smith']","['Executive frugality', 'Legal infractions', 'Financial reporting risk', 'Corporate culture']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001992,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,1,Robert Davidson,2015,169.55042125467324
Banks as patient fixed-income investors,"We examine the business model of traditional commercial banks when they compete with shadow banks. While both types of intermediaries create safe “money-like” claims, they go about this in different ways. Traditional banks create money-like claims by holding illiquid fixed-income assets to maturity, and they rely on deposit insurance and costly equity capital to support this strategy. This strategy allows bank depositors to remain “sleepy”: they do not have to pay attention to transient fluctuations in the market value of bank assets. In contrast, shadow banks create money-like claims by giving their investors an early exit option requiring the rapid liquidation of assets. Thus, traditional banks have a stable source of funding, while shadow banks are subject to runs and fire-sale losses. In equilibrium, traditional banks have a comparative advantage at holding fixed-income assets that have only modest fundamental risk but are illiquid and have substantial transitory price volatility, whereas shadow banks tend to hold relatively liquid assets.","['Samuel G.

The effect of institutional ownership on firm transparency and information production,"We examine the effects of institutional ownership on firms׳ information and trading environments using the annual Russell 1000/2000 index reconstitution. Characteristics of firms near the index cutoffs are similar, except that firms in the top of the Russell 2000 have discontinuously higher proportional institutional ownership than firms in the bottom of the Russell 1000 primarily due to indexing and benchmarking strategies. We find that higher institutional ownership is associated with greater management disclosure, analyst following, and liquidity, resulting in lower information asymmetry. Overall, indexing institutions׳ predilection for lower information asymmetries facilitates information production, which enhances monitoring and decreases trading costs.","['Audra L.

The illiquidity premium: International evidence,"We examine the illiquidity premium in stock markets across 45 countries and present two findings. First, the average illiquidity return premium across countries is positive and significant, after controlling for other pricing factors. The premium is measured by monthly return series on illiquid-minus-liquid stocks or by the coefficient of stock illiquidity estimated from cross section Fama-MacBeth regressions. Second, a commonality exists across countries in the illiquidity return premium, controlling for common global return factors and variation in global illiquidity. This commonality is different from commonality in illiquidity itself and is greater in globally integrated markets.","['Yakov Amihud', 'Allaudeen Hameed', 'Wenjin Kang', 'Huiping Zhang']","['Illiquidity premium', 'International markets', 'Commonality in illiquidity premium']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000483,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,2,Yakov Amihud,2015,169.55042125467324
Banks׳ liability structure and mortgage lending during the financial crisis,We examine the impact of banks׳ exposure to market liquidity shocks through wholesale funding on their supply of credit during the financial crisis using loan level data that best allow us to isolate supply-side effects. We find that banks that were more reliant on wholesale funding curtailed their credit significantly more than retail-funded banks. We also exploit the discrete fall in the liquidity of loans above the jumbo cutoff and show that this effect is significantly more pronounced for less liquid loans in line with a liquidity channel. We show that this result cannot be attributed to uneven shifts in demand. The negative relation between wholesale funding and the supply of credit is unique to the crisis episode.,"['Jihad Dagher', 'Kazim Kazimov']","['Wholesale funding', 'Credit supply', 'Liquidity risk', 'Financial crisis']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000069,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,3,Jihad Dagher,2015,169.55042125467324
"High-frequency quoting, trading, and the efficiency of prices","We examine the relation between high frequency quotation and the behavior of stock prices between 2009 and 2011 for the full cross section of securities in the US. On average, higher quotation activity is associated with price series that more closely resemble a random walk, and significantly lower cost of trading. We also explore market resiliency during periods of exceptionally high low-latency trading: large liquidity drawdowns in which, within the same millisecond, trading algorithms systematically sweep large volume across multiple trading venues. Although such large drawdowns incur trading costs, they do not appear to degrade the price formation process or increase the subsequent cost of trading. In an out-of-sample analysis, we investigate an exogenous technological change to the trading environment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange that dramatically reduces latency and allows co-location of servers. This shock also results in prices more closely resembling a random walk and a sharp decline in the cost of trading.","['Jennifer Conrad', 'Sunil Wahal', 'Jin Xiang']","['High frequency trading', 'Market microstructure', 'Market efficiency']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000240,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,2,Jennifer Conrad,2015,169.55042125467324
"When firms talk, do investors listen? The role of trust in stock market reactions to corporate earnings announcements","We examine whether the level of trust in a country affects investors' perception and utilization of information transmitted by firms through financial disclosure. Specifically, we investigate the effect of societal trust on investor reactions to corporate earnings announcements. We test two competing hypotheses. On the one hand, corporate earnings announcements are perceived as more credible by investors in more trusting societies and, therefore, elicit stronger investor reactions. On the other hand, societal trust mitigates outside investors' concern of moral hazard and reduces the value of corporate earnings announcements to them, thereby weakening their reactions to these events. We analyze the abnormal trading volume and abnormal stock return variance during the earnings announcement period in a large sample of firm-year observations across 25 countries, and we find that both measures of investor reactions to earnings announcements are significantly higher in more trusting countries. We also find that the positive effect of societal trust on investor reactions to earnings news is more pronounced when a country's investor protection and disclosure requirements are weaker, suggesting that trust acts as a substitute for formal institutions; when a country's average education level is lower, consistent with less educated people relying more on trust in making economic decisions; and when firm-level information asymmetry is higher, supporting the notion that trust plays a more important role in poorer information environments.","['Mikhail Pevzner', 'Fei Xie', 'Xiangang Xin']","['Culture', 'Trust', 'Corporate earnings announcement', 'Investor reaction']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002055,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,1,Mikhail Pevzner,2015,169.55042125467324
Does banking competition affect innovation?,"We exploit the deregulation of interstate bank branching laws to test whether banking competition affects innovation. We find robust evidence that banking competition reduces state-level innovation by public corporations headquartered within deregulating states. Innovation increases among private firms that are dependent on external finance and that have limited access to credit from local banks. We argue that banking competition enables small, innovative firms to secure financing instead of being acquired by public corporations. Therefore, banking competition reduces the supply of innovative targets, which reduces the portion of state-level innovation attributable to public corporations. Overall, these results shed light on the real effects of banking competition and the determinants of innovation.","['Jess Cornaggia', 'Yifei Mao', 'Xuan Tian', 'Brian Wolfe']","['Banking competition', 'Innovation', 'Access to finance', 'Mergers and acquisitions']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001858,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,1,Jess Cornaggia,2015,169.55042125467324
Investment and CEO compensation under limited commitment,"We extend the neoclassical investment model (Hayashi, 1982) to allow for limited commitment on compensation contracts. We consider three types of limited commitment: (i) managers cannot commit to compensation contracts that provide lower continuation utility than their outside options; (ii) shareholders cannot commit to negative net present value (NPV) projects; (iii) both the managers and the shareholders cannot commit. We characterize the optimal contract under general convex adjustment cost functions and provide examples for which closed-form solutions can be obtained. We show that, as in the data, small firms invest more, grow faster, and have a higher Tobin׳s Q than large firms under the optimal contract. In addition, the pattern of the dependence of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation on past performance implied by our model is also consistent with empirical evidence.","['Hengjie Ai', 'Rui Li']","['Dynamic contract', 'Limited commitment', 'Investment']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000458,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,3,Hengjie Ai,2015,169.55042125467324
Lost in translation? The effect of cultural values on mergers around the world,"We find strong evidence that three key dimensions of national culture (trust, hierarchy, and individualism) affect merger volume and synergy gains. The volume of cross-border mergers is lower when countries are more culturally distant. In addition, greater cultural distance in trust and individualism leads to lower combined announcement returns. These findings are robust to year and country-level fixed effects, time-varying country-pair and deal-level variables, as well as instrumental variables for cultural differences based on genetic and somatic differences. The results are the first large-scale evidence that cultural differences have substantial impacts on multiple aspects of cross-border mergers.","['Kenneth R.

Social learning and corporate peer effects,"We find that firms are more likely to split their stock if their peer firms have recently done so. The effect is comparable to an increase of 40–50% in the share price. Splitting probability is also increasing in the announcement returns of peer splits. These results are consistent with social learning from peers’ actions and outcomes. The unique features of the setting and various further tests render alternative explanations unlikely. We find no clear benefit in following successful peer splitters. Firms are sometimes suspected to succumb to imitation, and the effect we show could be a case in point.","['Markku Kaustia', 'Ville Rantala']","['Peer effect', 'Stock splits', 'Social learning']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000999,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,3,Markku Kaustia,2015,169.55042125467324
Value versus growth investing: Why do different investors have different styles?,"We find that several factors explain an individual investor׳s style, i.e., the value versus growth orientation of the investor׳s stock portfolio. First, we find that an investor׳s style has a biological basis and is partially ingrained in an investor from birth. Second, we show that an investor׳s hedging demands as well as behavioral biases explain investment style. Finally, an investor׳s style is explained by life course theory in that experiences, both earlier and later in life, are related to investment style. Investors with adverse macroeconomic experiences (e.g., growing up during the Great Depression or entering the labor market during an economic recession) or who grow up in a lower socioeconomic status rearing environment have a stronger value orientation several decades later. Our research contributes a new perspective to the long-standing value and growth debate in finance.","['Henrik Cronqvist', 'Stephan Siegel', 'Frank Yu']","['Investment behavior', 'Portfolio choice', 'Value investing', 'Growth investing']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000495,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,2,Henrik Cronqvist,2015,169.55042125467324
"Callable bonds, reinvestment risk, and credit rating improvements: Role of the call premium","We identify the call premium in nonconvertible callable bonds as an effective contracting provision to address agency conflict due to reinvestment risk and credit rating improvements. We analyze 4,495 bonds issued between 1980 and 2012. When interest rates are high, a majority of investment-grade issues and almost the entire subset with long maturities (>20 years) include a call premium. When interest rates are low, virtually all investment-grade issues with long and short maturities are callable at par. High-yield issues are limited to short maturities. By about 4:1, they include a call premium regardless of interest rate levels.","['Manish Tewari', 'Anthony Byrd', 'Pradipkumar Ramanlal']","['Corporate finance', 'Financing', 'Callable debt', 'Structured provisions', 'Agency conflict']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002086,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,2,Manish Tewari,2015,169.55042125467324
"Trading rules, competition for order flow and market fragmentation","We investigate competition between traditional stock exchanges and new dark trading venues using an important difference in regulatory treatment. Securities and Exchange Commission required minimum pricing increments constrain some stock spreads, causing large limit order queues. Dark pools allow some traders to bypass existing limit order queues with minimal price improvement. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that spread constraints significantly weaken exchanges׳ competitiveness. As more orders migrate to dark pools, the probability of subsequent order execution there increases, raising liquidity. The ability to circumvent time priority of displayed limit orders is one cause of the rapid rise in US equity market fragmentation.","['Amy Kwan', 'Ronald Masulis', 'Thomas H.

Government ownership and the cost of debt: Evidence from government investments in publicly traded firms,"We investigate how government equity ownership in publicly traded firms affects the cost of corporate debt. Using a sample of bond credit spreads from 43 countries over 1991–2010, we find that government ownership is generally associated with a higher cost of debt, consistent with state-induced investment distortions, but is associated with a lower cost of debt during financial crises and for firms more likely to be distressed, when implicit government guarantees become the dominant effect. Our results are robust to controls for the endogeneity of government ownership, and we find these effects to be specific to domestic government ownership.","['Ginka Borisova', 'Veljko Fotak', 'Kateryna Holland', 'William L.

"Smart money, dumb money, and capital market anomalies","We investigate the dual notions that “dumb money” exacerbates well-known stock return anomalies and “smart money” attenuates these anomalies. We find that aggregate flows to mutual funds (dumb money) appear to exacerbate cross-sectional mispricing, particularly for growth, accrual, and momentum anomalies. In contrast, hedge fund flows (smart money) appear to attenuate aggregate mispricing. Our results suggest that aggregate flows to mutual funds can have real adverse allocation effects in the stock market and that aggregate flows to hedge funds contribute to the correction of cross-sectional mispricing.","['Ferhat Akbas', 'Will J.

Trade credit and cross-country predictable firm returns,"We investigate the role of trade credit links in generating cross-border return predictability between international firms. Using data from 43 countries from 1993 to 2009, we find that firms with high trade credit located in producer countries have stock returns that are strongly predictable based on the returns of their associated customer countries. This behavior is especially prevalent among firms with high levels of foreign sales. To better understand this effect we develop an asset pricing model in which firms in different countries are connected by trade credit links. The model offers further predictions about this phenomenon, including stronger predictability during periods of high credit constraints and low uninformed trading volume. We find supportive empirical evidence for these predictions.","['Rui Albuquerque', 'Tarun Ramadorai', 'Sumudu W.

"Excess control rights, bank capital structure adjustments, and lending","We investigate whether excess control rights of ultimate owners in pyramids affect banks׳ capital ratio adjustments. When control and cash flow rights are identical, to boost capital ratios banks issue equity without cutting lending. However, when control rights exceed cash flow rights, instead of issuing equity, banks downsize by reducing lending. Such a finding is mostly prevalent in countries with weak shareholder protection or for family-controlled banks. Other factors also explain the extent to which such banks reduce lending. Our findings contribute to the capital structure adjustment literature and have critical policy implications for the implementation of Basel III and the debate on capital requirements and bank lending.","['Laetitia Lepetit', 'Nadia Saghi-Zedek', 'Amine Tarazi']","['Dynamic capital structure', 'Bank lending', 'Pyramids', 'Excess control rights', 'European banking']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1400213X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,3,Laetitia Lepetit,2015,169.55042125467324
Vulnerable banks,"We present a model in which fire sales propagate shocks across bank balance sheets. When a bank experiences a negative shock to its equity, a natural way to return to target leverage is to sell assets. If potential buyers are limited, then asset sales depress prices, in which case one bank׳s sales impact other banks with common exposures. We show how this contagion effect adds up across the banking sector, and how it can be estimated empirically using balance sheet data. We compute bank exposures to system-wide deleveraging, as well as the spillovers induced by individual banks. Applying the model to European banks, we evaluate a variety of interventions to reduce their vulnerability to fire sales during the sovereign debt crisis.","['Robin Greenwood', 'Augustin Landier', 'David Thesmar']","['Banks', 'Systemic risk', 'Fire sales', 'Price pressure', 'Contagion']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002529,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,3,Robin Greenwood,2015,169.55042125467324
The impact of Treasury supply on financial sector lending and stability,We present a theory in which the key driver of short-term debt issued by the financial sector is the portfolio demand for safe and liquid assets by the nonfinancial sector. This demand drives a premium on safe and liquid assets that the financial sector exploits by owning risky and illiquid assets and writing safe and liquid claims against them. The central prediction of the theory is that safe and liquid government debt should crowd out financial sector lending financed by short-term debt. We verify this prediction with US data from 1875 to 2014. We take a series of approaches to rule out standard crowding out via real interest rates and to address potential endogeneity concerns.,"['Arvind Krishnamurthy', 'Annette Vissing-Jorgensen']","['Treasury supply', 'Monetary economics', 'Financial stability', 'Banking']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001518,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,3,Arvind Krishnamurthy,2015,169.55042125467324
A theory of risk capital,We present a theory of risk capital and of how tax and other costs of risk capital should be allocated in a financial firm. Risk capital is equity investment that backs obligations to creditors and other liability holders and maintains the firm׳s credit quality. Credit quality is measured by the ratio of the value of the firm׳s option to default to the default-­free value of its liabilities. Marginal default values provide a full and unique allocation of risk capital. Efficient capital allocations maintain credit quality and preclude risk shifting. Our theory leads to an adjusted present value (APV) criterion for making investment and contracting decisions.

Modeling financial contagion using mutually exciting jump processes,"We propose a model to capture the dynamics of asset returns, with periods of crises that are characterized by contagion. In the model, a jump in one region of the world increases the intensity of jumps both in the same region (self-excitation) as well as in other regions (cross-excitation), generating episodes of highly clustered jumps across world markets that mimic the observed features of the data. We develop and implement moment-based estimation and testing procedures for this model. The estimates provide evidence of self-excitation both in the US and the other world markets, and of asymmetric cross-excitation, with the US market typically having more influence on the jump intensity of other markets than the reverse. We propose filtered values of the jump intensities as a measure of market stress and examine their out-of-sample forecasting abilities.","['Yacine Aït-Sahalia', 'Julio Cacho-Diaz', 'Roger J.A.

The bonding hypothesis of takeover defenses: Evidence from IPO firms,"We propose and test an efficiency explanation for why firms deploy takeover defenses using initial public offering (IPO) firm data. We hypothesize that takeover defenses bond the firm׳s commitments by reducing the likelihood that an outside takeover will change the firm׳s operating strategy and impose costs on its business partners. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that IPO firms deploy more takeover defenses when they have important business relationships to protect. An IPO firm׳s use of takeover defenses is positively related to the longevity of its business relationships. IPO firms’ use of takeover defenses creates positive spillovers for their large customers. And IPO firms’ valuation and subsequent operating performance are positively related to their use of takeover defenses when they have important business relationships.","['William C.

Regression-based estimation of dynamic asset pricing models,"We propose regression-based estimators for beta representations of dynamic asset pricing models with an affine pricing kernel specification. We allow for state variables that are cross-sectional pricing factors, forecasting variables for the price of risk, and factors that are both. The estimators explicitly allow for time-varying prices of risk, time-varying betas, and serially dependent pricing factors. Our approach nests the Fama-MacBeth two-pass estimator as a special case. We provide asymptotic multistage standard errors necessary to conduct inference for asset pricing tests. We illustrate our new estimators in an application to the joint pricing of stocks and bonds. The application features strongly time-varying, highly significant prices of risk that are found to be quantitatively more important than time-varying betas in reducing pricing errors.","['Tobias Adrian', 'Richard K.

The cross section of expected holding period returns and their dynamics: A present value approach,"We provide a tractable model of firm-level expected holding period returns using two firm fundamentals—book-to-market ratio and return on equity—and study the cross-sectional properties of the model-implied expected returns. We find that firm-level expected returns and expected profitability are time-varying but highly persistent and that forecasts of holding period returns strongly predict the cross section of future returns up to three years ahead. We show a highly significant predictive pooled regression slope for future quarterly returns of 0.86. The popular factor-based expected return models have either an insignificant or a significantly negative association with future returns. In supplemental analyses, we show that these forecasts are also informative of the time series variation in aggregate conditions. For a representative firm, the slope of the conditional expected return curve is more positive in good times, when expected short-run returns are relatively low, and the model-implied forecaster of aggregate returns exhibits modest predictive ability. Collectively, we provide a simple, theoretically motivated, and practically useful approach to estimating multi-period-ahead expected returns.","['Matthew R. Lyle', 'Charles C.Y.

Discount window stigma during the 2007–2008 financial crisis,"We provide empirical evidence for the existence, magnitude, and economic cost of stigma associated with banks borrowing from the Federal Reserve's Discount Window (DW) during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. We find that banks were willing to pay a premium of around 44 basis points (bps) across funding sources (126 bps after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers) to avoid borrowing from the DW. DW stigma is economically relevant as it increased some banks' borrowing cost by 32 bps of their pre-tax return on assets (ROA) during the crisis.

Non-executive employee stock options and corporate innovation,"We provide empirical evidence on the positive effect of non-executive employee stock options on corporate innovation. The positive effect is more pronounced when employees are more important for innovation, when free-riding among employees is weaker, when options are granted broadly to most employees, when the average expiration period of options is longer, and when employee stock ownership is lower.

Attentive insider trading,"We provide evidence that some profitable insider stock selling is motivated by public information. At firms that disclose having concentrated sales relationships, insiders appear to sell their own stock profitably based on public information about their principal customers. Supplier insiders also sell more stock when public information about their customers׳ recent returns and earnings surprises suggests they will earn larger profits. These results are stronger when outside investor attention could be lower. Outside of this setting, insiders engage in a higher proportion of routine sales and their sales are less profitable.

Empirical determinants of intertemporal choice,"We provide new evidence on the empirical determinants of intertemporal financial decisions. We use an exogenously imposed choice affecting nearly all Croatian retirees to study characteristics associated with choosing a larger, deferred stream of payments over a smaller, more immediate payment. Individuals are more willing to defer if they have higher incomes and are not liquidity constrained, have a longer time horizon because of better health and longer life expectancy, and have stronger bequest motives. Individuals who expect currency devaluation or political risk to reduce the value of future income are more likely to take the earlier income stream.","['Jeffrey R.

"Stocking up: Executive optimism, option exercise, and share retention","We show that an executive is optimistic about her company׳s prospects if and only if she retains some of the shares received whenever she exercises company stock options. Empirically, an indicator of optimism based on this idea matches the expected relations between optimism and corporate decision-making better than commonly used indicators based on the timing of option exercise. This makes sense, as our model of an executive׳s optimal option exercise and portfolio choice demonstrates that the timing of option exercise depends just as much on stock and other executive characteristics as it does on optimism.","['Rik Sen', 'Robert Tumarkin']","['Optimism', 'Executive stock option', 'Exercise policy', 'Optimism measures', 'Corporate financial policies']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001403,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,2,Rik Sen,2015,169.55042125467324
The “greatest” carry trade ever? Understanding eurozone bank risks,"We show that eurozone bank risks during 2007–2013 can be understood as carry trade behavior. Bank equity returns load positively on peripheral (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, or GIIPS) bond returns and negatively on German government bond returns, which generated carry until the deteriorating GIIPS bond returns adversely affected bank balance sheets. We find support for risk-shifting and regulatory arbitrage motives at banks in that carry trade behavior is stronger for large banks and banks with low capital ratios and high risk-weighted assets. We also find evidence for home bias and moral suasion in the subsample of GIIPS banks.","['Viral V.

"Suspect CEOs, unethical culture, and corporate misbehavior","We show that firms with Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) who personally benefit from options backdating are more likely to engage in other corporate misbehaviors, suggestive of an unethical corporate culture. These firms are more likely to commit financial fraud to overstate earnings. They acquire more private companies, which could perpetuate their frauds, and their acquisitions are met with lower market responses. These misbehaviors are concentrated in firms with externally hired suspect CEOs, consistent with outside CEOs having greater discretion to shape firm culture. The costs of these misbehaviors are reflected in larger stock price declines during a market correction and increased CEO replacement.","['Lee Biggerstaff', 'David C.

End-of-the-year economic growth and time-varying expected returns,"We show that macroeconomic growth at the end of the year (fourth quarter or December) strongly influences expected returns on risky financial assets, whereas economic growth during the rest of the year does not. We find this pattern for many different asset classes, across different time periods, and for US and international data. We also show that movements in the surplus consumption ratio of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), a theoretically well-founded measure of time-varying risk aversion linked to macroeconomic growth, influence expected returns stronger during the fourth quarter than the other quarters of the year. Our findings suggest that expected returns, risk aversion, and economic growth are particularly related at the end of the year, when we also expect consumers׳ portfolio adjustments to be concentrated.","['Stig V.

"House prices, collateral, and self-employment","We show the importance of the collateral lending channel for small business employment over the past decade. Small businesses in areas with greater increases in house prices experienced stronger growth in employment than large firms in the same areas and industries. To identify the role of the collateral lending channel separately from aggregate changes in demand, we show that this effect is more pronounced in industries that need little start-up capital and in which housing collateral is more important. This increase is also present in manufacturing industries, particularly those that ship goods over long distances. In aggregate, the collateral lending channel explains 15–25% of employment variation.","['Manuel Adelino', 'Antoinette Schoar', 'Felipe Severino']","['Housing', 'Collateral', 'Self-employment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Small business']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1500029X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,117,2,Manuel Adelino,2015,169.55042125467324
Asset pricing with arbitrage activity,"We study an economy populated by three groups of myopic agents: constrained agents subject to a portfolio constraint that limits their risk taking, unconstrained agents subject to a standard nonnegative wealth constraint, and arbitrageurs with access to a credit facility. Such credit is valuable as it allows arbitrageurs to exploit the limited arbitrage opportunities that emerge endogenously in reaction to the demand imbalance generated by the portfolio constraint. The model is solved in closed-form, and we show that, in contrast to existing models with frictions and logarithmic agents, arbitrage activity has an impact on the price level and generates both excess volatility and the leverage effect. We show that these results are due to the fact that arbitrageurs amplify fundamental shocks by levering up in good times and deleveraging in bad times.","['Julien Hugonnier', 'Rodolfo Prieto']","['Limits of arbitrage', 'Rational bubbles', 'Wealth constraints', 'Excess volatility', 'Leverage effect']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002104,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,2,Julien Hugonnier,2015,169.55042125467324
Hedge funds and discretionary liquidity restrictions,"We study hedge funds that imposed discretionary liquidity restrictions (DLRs) on investor shares during the financial crisis. DLRs prolong fund life, but impose liquidity costs on investors, creating a potential conflict of interest. Ostensibly, funds establish DLRs to limit performance-driven withdrawals that could force fire sales of illiquid assets. However, after they restrict investor liquidity, DLR funds do not reduce illiquid stock sales and underperform a control sample of non-DLR funds. Consequently, DLRs appear to negatively impact fund family reputation. After the crisis, funds from DLR families faced difficulties raising capital and were more likely to cut their fees.","['Adam L.

Importing corruption culture from overseas: Evidence from corporate tax evasion in the United States,"We study how cultural norms and enforcement policies influence illicit corporate activities. Using confidential Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit data, we show that corporations with owners from countries with higher corruption norms evade more tax in the U.S. This effect is strong for small corporations and decreases as the size of the corporation increases. In the mid-2000s, the United States implemented several enforcement measures to increase tax compliance. We find that these enforcement efforts were less effective in reducing tax evasion by corporations whose owners are from corrupt countries. This suggests that cultural norms can be a challenge to legal enforcement.","['Jason DeBacker', 'Bradley T.

Competition of the informed: Does the presence of short sellers affect insider selling?,"We study how the presence of short sellers affects the incentives of the insiders to trade on negative information. We show it induces insiders to sell more (shares from their existing stakes) and trade faster to preempt the potential competition from short sellers. An experiment and instrumental variable analysis confirm this causal relationship. The effects are stronger for “opportunistic” (i.e., more informed) insider trades and when short sellers׳ attention is high. Return predictability of insider sales only occurs in stocks with high short-selling potential, suggesting that short sellers indirectly enhance the speed of information dissemination by accelerating trading by insiders.","['Massimo Massa', 'Wenlan Qian', 'Weibiao Xu', 'Hong Zhang']","['Short selling', 'Insider trading', 'Informed trader', 'Market efficiency']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001439,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,118,2,Massimo Massa,2015,169.55042125467324
Do investors overpay for stocks with lottery-like payoffs? An examination of the returns of OTC stocks,"We study returns on over-the-counter stocks and find that these returns are extremely negative on average. The distribution of OTC stock returns is highly positively skewed: while many of the stocks in our sample become worthless, a few do extremely well. We investigate whether this negative return premium can be rationalized by investors׳ preference for positively skewed payoffs. We show that the equilibrium model of Barberis and Huang (2008) provides a plausible explanation for the negative returns. We also show that OTC stocks that once traded on the regular exchanges perform much better than stocks that originate in the OTC markets.","['Bjørn Eraker', 'Mark Ready']","['Prospect theory', 'Skewness', 'Lottery stocks', 'OTCBB']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002372,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,3,Bjørn Eraker,2015,169.55042125467324
The risk premia embedded in index options,"We study the dynamic relation between market risks and risk premia using time series of index option surfaces. We find that priced left tail risk cannot be spanned by market volatility (and its components) and introduce a new tail factor. This tail factor has no incremental predictive power for future volatility and jump risks, beyond current and past volatility, but is critical in predicting future market equity and variance risk premia. Our findings suggest a wide wedge between the dynamics of market risks and their compensation, which typically displays a far more persistent reaction following market crises.","['Torben G.

CEO network centrality and merger performance,"We study the effects on M&A outcomes of CEO network centrality, which measures the extent and strength of a CEO׳s personal connections. High network centrality can allow CEOs to efficiently gather and control private information, facilitating value-creating acquisition decisions. We show, however, that M&A deals initiated by high-centrality CEOs, in addition to being more frequent, carry greater value losses to both the acquirer and the combined entity than deals initiated by low-centrality CEOs. We also document that high-centrality CEOs are capable of avoiding the discipline of the markets for corporate control and the executive labor market, and that the mitigating effect of internal governance on CEO actions is limited. Our evidence suggests that corporate decisions can be influenced by a CEO׳s position in the social hierarchy, with high-centrality CEOs using their power and influence to increase entrenchment and reap private benefits.","['Rwan El-Khatib', 'Kathy Fogel', 'Tomas Jandik']","['Network centrality', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Corporate governance', 'Corporate control market', 'Managerial labor market']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000021,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,2,Rwan El-Khatib,2015,169.55042125467324
"Market run-ups, market freezes, inventories, and leverage","We study trade between an informed seller and an uninformed buyer who have existing inventories of assets similar to those being traded. We show that these inventories could induce the buyer to increase the price (a run-up) but could also make trade impossible (a freeze) and hamper information dissemination. Competition can amplify the run-up by inducing buyers to purchase assets at a loss to prevent competitors from purchasing at lower prices and releasing bad news about inventories. In a dynamic extension, we show that a market freeze could be preceded by high prices.

Yet, when employees perceive top managers as trustworthy and ethical, a firm׳s performance is stronger. We then study how different governance structures impact the ability to sustain integrity as a corporate value. We find that publicly traded firms are less able to sustain it.

Structured debt ratings: Evidence on conflicts of interest,"We test if issuers of asset- and mortgage-backed securities receive rating favors from agencies with which they maintain strong business relationships. Controlling for issuer fixed effects and a large set of credit risk determinants, we show that agencies publish better ratings for those issuers that provide them with more bilateral securitization business. Such rating favors are larger for very complex structured debt deals and for deals issued during the credit boom period. Our analysis is based on a new deal-level rating statistic that accounts for the full distribution of tranche ratings below the AAA cut-off point of a structured debt deal.","['Matthias Efing', 'Harald Hau']","['Credit ratings', 'Ratings inflation', 'Conflict of interest', 'Structured debt']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002554,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,1,Matthias Efing,2015,169.55042125467324
Capital allocation and delegation of decision-making authority within firms,"We use a unique data set that contains information on more than 1,000 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) around the world to investigate the degree to which executives delegate financial decisions and the circumstances that drive variation in delegation. Delegation does not appear to be monolithic; instead, our results show that it varies across corporate policies and also varies with the personal characteristics of the CEO. We find that CEOs delegate financial decisions for which they need the most input, when they are overloaded, and when they are distracted by recent acquisitions. CEOs delegate less when they are knowledgeable (long-tenured or with a finance background). Capital is allocated based on “gut feel” and the personal reputation of the manager running a given division. Finally, corporate politics and corporate socialism affect capital allocation in European and Asian firms.","['John R. Graham', 'Campbell R.

Central clearing and collateral demand,"We use an extensive data set of bilateral credit default swap (CDS) positions to estimate the impact on collateral demand of new clearing and margin regulations. The estimated collateral demands include initial margin and the frictional demands associated with the movement of variation margin through the network of market participants. We estimate the impact on total collateral demand of more widespread initial margin requirements, increased novation of CDS to central clearing parties (CCPs), an increase in the number of clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized and non-specialized types, collateral rehypothecation practices, and client clearing. System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared. Given these dealer-to-dealer initial margin requirements, mandatory central clearing is shown to lower, not raise, system-wide collateral demand, provided there is no significant proliferation of CCPs. Central clearing does, however, have significant distributional consequences for collateral requirements across market participants.","['Darrell Duffie', 'Martin Scheicher', 'Guillaume Vuillemey']","['Central clearing party', 'Margin', 'Credit default swap', 'Collateral', 'Client clearing']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002761,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,2,Darrell Duffie,2015,169.55042125467324
Does realized skewness predict the cross-section of equity returns?,We use intraday data to compute weekly realized moments for equity returns and study their time-series and cross-sectional properties. Buying stocks in the lowest realized skewness decile and selling stocks in the highest realized skewness decile generates an average return of 19 basis points the following week with a t-statistic of 3.70. This result is robust across a wide variety of implementations and is not captured by the Fama-French and Carhart factors.

Female leadership and gender equity: Evidence from plant closure,"We use unique worker-plant matched panel data to measure differences in wage changes experienced by workers displaced from closing plants. We observe larger losses among women than men, comparing workers who move from the same closing plant to the same new firm. However, we find a significantly smaller gap in hiring firms with female leadership. The results are strongest among women who are displaced from male-led plants and from less competitive industries.

"Contractual incompleteness, limited liability and asset price bubbles","When should we expect bubbles? Can levered intermediaries bid up risky asset prices through asset substitution? We study an economy with financial intermediaries that issue debt and equity to buy risky assets. Asset substitution alone cannot cause bubbles because it is priced into the intermediaries׳ securities. But incomplete contracts and managerial agency problems can make intermediaries take excessive risk to exploit limited liability, bidding up risky asset prices. This destroys welfare through misallocation of resources. We argue that incentives for private monitoring cannot solve this problem. Finally, even without agency problems, debt subsidies will create similar effects.","['James Dow', 'Jungsuk Han']","['Leverage', 'Limited liability', 'Bubbles', 'Contractual incompleteness', 'Asset substitution']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000070,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,116,2,James Dow,2015,169.55042125467324
Why do term structures in different currencies co-move?,"Yield curve fluctuations across different currencies are highly correlated. This paper investigates this phenomenon by exploring the channels through which macroeconomic shocks are transmitted across borders. Macroeconomic shocks affect current and expected future short-term rates as central banks react to changing economic environments. Investors could also respond to these shocks by altering their required compensation for risk. Macroeconomic shocks thus influence bond yields both through a policy channel and through a risk compensation channel. Using data from the US, the UK, and Germany, we find that world inflation and US yield level together explain over two-thirds of the covariance of yields at all maturities. Further, these effects operate largely through the risk compensation channel for long-term bonds.","['Chotibhak Jotikasthira', 'Anh Le', 'Christian Lundblad']","['Macro-finance term structure model', 'Interest rates', 'Cross-country co-movement']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001883,Journal of Financial Economics,0.822560186409838,115,1,Chotibhak Jotikasthira,2015,169.55042125467324
Are hedge fund managers systematically misreporting? Or not?,"A discontinuity, or kink, at zero in the hedge fund net return distribution has been interpreted as evidence of managers manipulating returns to avoid showing small losses. Instead, we propose alternative explanations for this phenomenon. In particular, we show that incentive fees can mechanistically create a kink in the net return distribution. This mechanism accounts for almost the entire kink observed in the large, liquid Long-Short Equity style. Furthermore, we show that asset illiquidity and the bounding of yields at zero can generate distribution discontinuities as well. Therefore, we conclude that the observed hedge fund return discontinuities are not direct proof of manipulation.","['Philippe Jorion', 'Christopher Schwarz']","['Hedge funds', 'Performance evaluation', 'Valuation', 'Risk']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1300250X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,2,Philippe Jorion,2014,169.4662771250183

Firms started up by common stock investors have about 25% lower sales and 15% lower return on assets. The results are similar using personal leverage and other risk-tolerance proxies.

Does option trading convey stock price information?,"After executing option orders, options market makers turn to the stock market to hedge away the underlying stock exposure. As a result, the stock exposure imbalance in option transactions translates into an imbalance in stock transactions. This paper decomposes the total stock order imbalance into an imbalance induced by option transactions and an imbalance independent of options. The analysis shows that the option-induced imbalance significantly predicts future stock returns in the cross section controlling for the past stock and options returns, but the imbalance independent of options has only a transitory price impact.

Do independent directors cause improvements in firm transparency?,"Although recent research documents a positive relation between corporate transparency and the proportion of independent directors, the direction of causality is unclear.

We also examine whether these effects vary as a function of management entrenchment, information processing costs, and required changes to audit committee independence. Our results suggest that firms can alter their corporate transparency to suit the informational demands of a particular board structure.","['Christopher S. Armstrong', 'John E. Core', 'Wayne R.

Dynamic risk management,"Both financing and risk management involve promises to pay that need to be collateralized, resulting in a financing versus risk management trade-off.

We show that these predictions are consistent with the evidence using panel data for fuel price risk management by airlines. More constrained airlines hedge less both in the cross section and within airlines over time. Risk management drops substantially as airlines approach distress and recovers only slowly after airlines enter distress.","['Adriano A. Rampini', 'Amir Sufi', 'S.

Consistent with an investor preference for skewed, lottery-like payoffs, stocks with high predicted probabilities for jackpot returns earn abnormally low average returns. Stocks with high death or jackpot probabilities have relatively low institutional ownership and the jackpot effect we find is much stronger in stocks with high limits to arbitrage.","['Jennifer Conrad', 'Nishad Kapadia', 'Yuhang Xing']","['Distress risk', 'Skewness', 'Stock returns', 'Anomalies']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000609,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,3,Jennifer Conrad,2014,169.4662771250183

Syndicated loan spreads and the composition of the syndicate,"During the past decade, non-bank institutional investors are increasingly taking larger roles in the corporate lending than they historically have played. These non-bank institutional lenders typically have higher required rates of return than banks, but invest in the same loan facilities. In a sample of 20,031 leveraged loan facilities originated between 1997 and 2007, facilities including a non-bank institution in their syndicates have higher spreads than otherwise identical bank-only facilities. Contrary to risk-based explanations of this finding, non-bank facilities are priced with premiums relative to bank-only facilities in the same loan package. These non-bank premiums are substantially larger when a hedge or private equity fund is one of the syndicate members. Consistent with the notion that firms are willing to pay a premium when loan facilities are particularly important to them, the non-bank premiums are larger when borrowing firms face financial constraints and when capital is less available from banks.","['Jongha Lim', 'Bernadette A.

Advancing the universality of quadrature methods to any underlying process for option pricing,"Exceptional accuracy and speed for option pricing are available via quadrature (Andricopoulos, Widdicks, Duck, and Newton, 2003), extending into multiple dimensions with complex path-dependency and early exercise (Andricopoulos, Widdicks, Newton, and Duck, 2007). However, the exposition is incomplete, leaving many modelling processes outside the Black-Scholes-Merton framework unattainable. We show how to remove the remaining major block to universal application. Although this had appeared highly problematic, the solution turns out to be conceptually simple and implementation is straightforward (we provide code on the Journal of Financial Economics website at http://jfe.rochester.edu). Crucially, the method retains its speed and flexibility across complex combinations of option features but is now applicable across other underlying processes.","['Ding Chen', 'Hannu J.

The long of it: Odds that investor sentiment spuriously predicts anomaly returns,"Extremely long odds accompany the chance that spurious-regression bias accounts for investor sentiment׳s observed role in stock-return anomalies. We replace investor sentiment with a simulated persistent series in regressions reported by Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012), who find higher long-short anomaly profits following high sentiment, due entirely to the short leg. Among 200 million simulated regressors, we find none that support those conclusions as strongly as investor sentiment. The key is consistency across anomalies. Obtaining just the predicted signs for the regression coefficients across the 11 anomalies examined in the above study occurs only once for every 43 simulated regressors.","['Robert F.

Did CDS trading improve the market for corporate bonds?,"Financial innovation through the creation of new markets and securities impacts related markets as well, changing their efficiency, quality (pricing error), and liquidity. The credit default swap (CDS) market was undoubtedly one of the salient new markets of the past decade. In this paper we examine whether the advent of CDS trading was beneficial to the underlying secondary market for corporate bonds. We employ econometric specifications that account for information across CDS, bond, equity, and volatility markets. We also develop a novel methodology to utilize all observations in our data set even when continuous daily trading is not evidenced, because bonds trade much less frequently than equities. Using an extensive sample of CDS and bond trades over 2002–2008, we find that the advent of CDS was largely detrimental. Bond markets became less efficient, evidenced no reduction in pricing errors, and experienced no improvement in liquidity. These findings are robust to various slices of the data set and specifications of our tests.","['Sanjiv Das', 'Madhu Kalimipalli', 'Subhankar Nayak']","['CDS', 'Bond market efficiency']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1300281X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,2,Sanjiv Das,2014,169.4662771250183
Birds of a feather: Value implications of political alignment between top management and directors,"For 2,695 US corporations from 1996 to 2009, we find that alignment in political orientation between the chief executive officer (CEO) and independent directors is associated with lower firm valuations, lower operating profitability, and increased internal agency conflicts such as a reduced likelihood of dismissing poorly performing CEOs, a lower CEO pay-performance sensitivity, and a greater likelihood of accounting fraud. Importantly, we show that our results are driven neither by the effects associated with various measures of similarity and diversity within the board nor the effects of local director labor market and political conditions on board structure. We provide evidence that our measure of individual political orientation reflects the person׳s political beliefs rather than opportunistic attempts to seek political favor. Overall, our results suggest that diversity in political beliefs among corporate board members is valuable.","['Jongsub Lee', 'Kwang J. Lee', 'Nandu J.

The genetics of investment biases,"For a long list of investment “biases,” including lack of diversification, excessive trading, and the disposition effect, we find that genetic differences explain up to 45% of the remaining variation across individual investors, after controlling for observable individual characteristics. The evidence is consistent with a view that investment biases are manifestations of innate and evolutionary ancient features of human behavior. We find that work experience with finance reduces genetic predispositions to investment biases. Finally, we find that even genetically identical investors, who grew up in the same family environment, often differ substantially in their investment behaviors due to individual-specific experiences or events.","['Henrik Cronqvist', 'Stephan Siegel']","['Investment biases', 'Behavioral genetics', 'Portfolio choice']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000889,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,2,Henrik Cronqvist,2014,169.4662771250183
Disagreement and asset prices,"How do differences of opinion affect asset prices? Do investors earn a risk premium when disagreement arises in the market? Despite their fundamental importance, these questions are among the most controversial issues in finance. In this paper, we use a novel data set that allows us to directly measure the level of disagreement among Wall Street mortgage dealers about prepayment speeds. We examine how disagreement evolves over time and study its effects on expected returns, return volatility, and trading volume in the mortgage-backed security market. We find that increased disagreement is associated with higher expected returns, higher return volatility, and larger trading volume. These results imply that there is a positive risk premium for disagreement in asset prices. We also show that volatility in and of itself does not lead to higher trading volume. Instead, only when disagreement arises in the market is higher uncertainty associated with more trading. Finally, we are able to distinguish empirically between two competing hypotheses regarding how information in markets gets incorporated into asset prices. We find that sophisticated investors appear to update their beliefs through a rational expectations mechanism when disagreement arises.","['Bruce I. Carlin', 'Francis A.

The value of diffusing information,"How does the speed by which information diffuses affect its value to a stock market investor? In a structural model solved in closed-form, this speed has two opposing effects on the empirically dominant term of the value of information. Faster-diffusing information means quicker and less noisy profits, but, also increases competing informed trading, impounding more information into prices and eroding profits.

The role of stock ownership by US members of Congress on the market for political favors,"I examine whether stock ownership by politicians helps to enforce noncontractible quid pro quo relations with firms. The ownership by US Congress members in firms contributing to their election campaigns is higher than in noncontributors. This bias toward contributors depends on the financial incentives of politicians and the relation's value. Firms with a stronger ownership–contribution association receive more government contracts. The financial gains from these contracts are economically large. When politicians divest stocks, firms discontinue contributions to the politicians, lose future contracts, and perform poorly.

We show that the uncertainty elasticity of liquidity (UEL: percent change in liquidity given a 1% change in VIX) has increased around regulatory changes in the US markets that increased the role of public traders in liquidity provision, reduced the minimum allowable price variation, weakened the affirmative obligation of NASDAQ dealers, and abolished the specialist system on the NYSE.","['Kee H.

The Idealized Electoral College voting mechanism and shareholder power,"Increasing concern over corporate governance has led to calls for more shareholder influence over corporate decisions, but allowing shareholders to vote on more issues may not affect the quality of governance. We should expect instead that, under current rules, shareholder voting will implement the preferences of the majority of large shareholders and management. This is because majority rule offers little incentive for small shareholders to vote. I offer a potential remedy in the form of a new voting rule, the Idealized Electoral College (IEC), modeled on the American Electoral College, that significantly increases the expected impact that a given shareholder has on election. The benefit of the mechanism is that it induces greater turnout, but the cost is that it sometimes assigns a winner that is not preferred by a majority of voters. Therefore, for issues on which management and small shareholders are likely to disagree, the IEC is superior to majority rule.",['Edward D.

Overcoming limits of arbitrage: Theory and evidence,"Limits to arbitrage arise because financial intermediaries may face funding constraints when mispricing worsens. Using a model with limits to arbitrage, where we allow arbitrageurs to secure capital even in case of underperformance, we show that arbitrageurs that are more protected from withdrawals have more mean-reverting and volatile returns. Using data on hedge fund performance, we find robust support for these hypotheses: Funds with contractual impediments to withdrawals, and funds with performance-insensitive outflows, recover more quickly after a bad year and have more volatile returns. Our evidence is consistent with the idea that some hedge funds overcome the limits to arbitrage.","['Johan Hombert', 'David Thesmar']","['Limits to arbitrage', 'Hedge funds', 'Capital structure']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002493,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,1,Johan Hombert,2014,169.4662771250183
Mortgage convexity,"Most home mortgages in the United States are fixed-rate loans with an embedded prepayment option. When long-term rates decline, the effective duration of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) falls due to heightened refinancing expectations. I show that these changes in MBS duration function as large-scale shocks to the quantity of interest rate risk that must be borne by professional bond investors. I develop a simple model in which the risk tolerance of bond investors is limited in the short run, so these fluctuations in MBS duration generate significant variation in bond risk premia. Specifically, bond risk premia are high when aggregate MBS duration is high. The model offers an explanation for why long-term rates could appear to be excessively sensitive to movements in short rates and explains how changes in MBS duration act as a positive-feedback mechanism that amplifies interest rate volatility. I find strong support for these predictions in the time series of US government bond returns.",['Samuel G.

Learning from peers' stock prices and corporate investment,"Peers' valuation matters for firms' investment: a one standard deviation increase in peers' valuation is associated with a 5.9% increase in corporate investment. This association is stronger when a firm's stock price informativeness is lower or when its managers appear less informed. Also, the sensitivity of a firm's investment to its stock price is lower when its peers' stock price informativeness is higher or when demands for its products and its peers' products are more correlated. Furthermore, the sensitivity of firms' investment to their peers' valuation drops significantly after going public.

Bond market access and investment,"Prior research has shown that differential access to debt markets significantly affects capital structure. In this paper, we examine the effect of access to debt markets on investment decisions by using debt ratings to indicate bond market access. We find that rated firms are more likely to undertake acquisitions than nonrated firms. This finding remains even after accounting for firm characteristics, for the probability of being rated, and in matched sample analysis as well as in subsamples based on leverage, firm size, age and information opacity. Rated firms also pay higher premiums for their targets and receive less favorable market reaction to their acquisition announcements relative to non-rated firms. However, the average announcement returns to rated acquirers are non-negative. Collectively, these findings suggest that the lack of debt market access has a real effect on the ability to make investments as well as on the quality of these investments by creating underinvestment, instead of simply constraining overinvestment.","['Jarrad Harford', 'Vahap B.

Motivating innovation in newly public firms,"Prior research suggests that executive option grants that do not quickly vest provide managers with better incentives to pursue long-term, instead of short-term, objectives. Previous research also suggests that the pursuit of long-term objectives could be undermined by the risk of early termination. We conjecture that these arguments jointly suggest that managers are better motivated to pursue innovation when they are given more incentive compensation with longer vesting periods for unexercised options and yet some protection from disruptive takeover threats. Our evidence for a sample of newly public firms is consistent with more innovative firms jointly choosing such a combination.","['Nina Baranchuk', 'Robert Kieschnick', 'Rabih Moussawi']","['Innovation', 'Vesting period', 'Incentive compensation']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002997,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,3,Nina Baranchuk,2014,169.4662771250183
Trading in derivatives when the underlying is scarce,"Regulatory restrictions and market frictions can constrain the aggregate quantity of long and short positions in a security.

We also show that it is especially important to analyze the underlying and derivative markets jointly when evaluating the impact of regulation, such as short-sales bans and position limits in derivatives, that restricts trade.","['Snehal Banerjee', 'Jeremy J.

On the systematic volatility of unpriced earnings,"Some important puzzles in macro finance can be resolved in a model featuring systematically varying volatility of unpriced shocks to firms׳ earnings. In the data, the correlation between corporate debt and stock market valuations is low. The model accounts for this via the opposing effect of unpriced earnings risk on levered debt and equity prices. The model also explains the low (or nonexistent) risk-reward relation for the market portfolio of levered equity via the opposing effects of unpriced and priced uncertainty (both components of stock volatility) on the levered equity risk premium. Versions of the model calibrated to empirical measures of both types of fundamental risk can quantitatively substantiate these explanations. Variation in residual earning dispersion accounts for a significant fraction of observed disagreement between debt and equity valuations and of realized stock volatility. The implication that the two components of risk should forecast the levered equity risk premium with opposite signs is also supported in the data. The results are a notable advance for risk-based asset pricing.","['Timothy C.

Correctly accounting for this variation is crucial for the empirical performance of the model. The DR-CAPM can jointly rationalize the cross section of equity, equity index options, commodity, sovereign bond and currency returns, thus offering a unified risk view of these asset classes.

Acquirer-target social ties and merger outcomes,"This article investigates the effect of social ties between acquirers and targets on merger performance. We find that the extent of cross-firm social connection between directors and senior executives at the acquiring and the target firms has a significantly negative effect on the abnormal returns to the acquirer and to the combined entity upon merger announcement. Moreover, acquirer-target social ties significantly increase the likelihood that the target firm׳s chief executive officer (CEO) and a larger fraction of the target firm׳s pre-acquisition board of directors remain on the board of the combined firm after the merger. In addition, we find that acquirer CEOs are more likely to receive bonuses and are more richly compensated for completing mergers with targets that are highly connected to the acquiring firms, that acquisitions are more likely to take place between two firms that are well connected to each other through social ties, and that such acquisitions are more likely to subsequently be divested for performance-related reasons. Taken together, our results suggest that social ties between the acquirer and the target lead to poorer decision making and lower value creation for shareholders overall.","['Joy Ishii', 'Yuhai Xuan']","['Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'Social ties', 'Social connections']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000385,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,3,Joy Ishii,2014,169.4662771250183
A dynamic limit order market with fast and slow traders,"This paper considers the role of high-frequency trading in a dynamic limit order market. Fast traders׳ ability to revise their quotes quickly after news arrivals helps to reduce the inefficiency that is rooted in the risk of being picked off, which increases trade. However, their presence induces slow traders to strategically submit limit orders with a lower execution probability, thereby reducing trade. Because speed is a source of market power, it enables fast traders to extract rents from other market participants and triggers a costly arms race that reduces social welfare. The model generates a number of testable implications concerning the effects of high-frequency trading in limit order markets.",['Peter Hoffmann'],"['High-frequency trading', 'Limit order market']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000610,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,1,Peter Hoffmann,2014,169.4662771250183
Macroeconomic risk and hedge fund returns,"This paper estimates hedge fund and mutual fund exposure to newly proposed measures of macroeconomic risk that are interpreted as measures of economic uncertainty. We find that the resulting uncertainty betas explain a significant proportion of the cross-sectional dispersion in hedge fund returns. However, the same is not true for mutual funds, for which there is no significant relationship. After controlling for a large set of fund characteristics and risk factors, the positive relation between uncertainty betas and future hedge fund returns remains economically and statistically significant. Hence, we argue that macroeconomic risk is a powerful determinant of cross-sectional differences in hedge fund returns.","['Turan G. Bali', 'Stephen J. Brown', 'Mustafa O.

Can investor-paid credit rating agencies improve the information quality of issuer-paid rating agencies?,"This paper examines how the information quality of ratings from an issuer-paid rating agency (Standard and Poor's) responds to the entry of an investor-paid rating agency, the Egan-Jones Rating Company (EJR). By comparing S&P's ratings quality before and after EJR initiates coverage of each firm, I find a significant improvement in S&P's ratings quality following EJR's coverage initiation. S&P's ratings become more responsive to credit risk and its rating changes incorporate higher information content. These results differ from the existing literature documenting a deterioration in the incumbents' ratings quality following the entry of a third issuer-paid agency. I further show that the issuer-paid agency seems to improve the ratings quality because EJR's coverage has elevated its reputational concerns.",['Han Xia'],"['Credit ratings', 'Information quality', 'Investor-paid rating agencies']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002778,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,2,Han Xia,2014,169.4662771250183
"The impact of central clearing on counterparty risk, liquidity, and trading: Evidence from the credit default swap market","This paper examines the impact of central clearing on the credit default swap (CDS) market using a sample of voluntarily cleared single-name contracts. Consistent with central clearing reducing counterparty risk, CDS spreads increase around the commencement of central clearing and are lower than settlement spreads published by the central clearinghouse. Furthermore, the relation between CDS spreads and dealer credit risk weakens after central clearing begins, suggesting a lowering of systemic risk. These findings are robust to controls for frictions in both CDS and bond markets. Finally, matched sample analysis reveals that the increased post-trade transparency following central clearing is associated with an improvement in liquidity and trading activity.","['Yee Cheng Loon', 'Zhaodong Ken Zhong']","['Central clearing', 'Counterparty risk', 'Systemic risk', 'Liquidity', 'Credit default swap']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13003012,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,1,Yee Cheng Loon,2014,169.4662771250183
Firm boundaries matter: Evidence from conglomerates and R&D activity,"This paper examines the impact of the conglomerate form on the scale and novelty of corporate Research and Development (R&D) activity. I exploit a quasi-experiment involving failed mergers to generate exogenous variation in acquisition outcomes of target firms. A difference-in-differences estimation reveals that, relative to failed targets, firms acquired in diversifying mergers produce both a smaller number of innovations and also less-novel innovations, where innovations are measured using patent-based metrics. The treatment effect is amplified if the acquiring conglomerate operates a more active internal capital market and is largely driven by inventors becoming less productive after the merger rather than inventor exits. Concurrently, acquirers move R&D activity outside the boundary of the firm via the use of strategic alliances and joint ventures. There is complementary evidence that conglomerates with more novel R&D tend to operate with decentralized R&D budgets. These findings suggest that conglomerate organizational form affects the allocation and productivity of resources.",['Amit Seru'],"['Conglomerates', 'Theory of firm', 'Innovation', 'R&D', 'Mergers', 'Incentives']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1300278X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,2,Amit Seru,2014,169.4662771250183
What do firms do when dividend tax rates change? An examination of alternative payout responses,"This paper investigates whether investor-level taxes affect corporate payout policy decisions. We predict and find a surge of special dividends in the final months of 2010 and 2012, immediately before individual-level dividend tax rates were expected to increase. We also find evidence that immediately before the expected tax increases, firms altered the timing of their regular dividend payments by shifting what would normally be January regular dividend payments into the preceding December. To our knowledge this is the first evidence in the literature about changes in the timing of regular dividend payments in response to tax law changes. For both actions (specials and shifting), we find that it was more likely for a firm to respond to individual-level tax rates if insiders owned a relatively large amount of the firm. Overall, our paper provides evidence that managers consider individual-level taxes in making corporate payout decisions.","['Michelle Hanlon', 'Jeffrey L.

Tailspotting: Identifying and profiting from CEO vacation trips,"This paper shows connections between chief executive officers׳ (CEOs׳) absences from headquarters and corporate news disclosures. I identify CEO absences by merging records of corporate jet flights and CEOs׳ property ownership near leisure destinations. CEOs travel to their vacation homes just after companies report favorable news, and CEOs return to headquarters right before subsequent news releases. When CEOs are away, companies announce less news, mandatory disclosures occur later, and stock volatility falls sharply. Volatility increases when CEOs return to work. CEOs spend fewer days out of the office when ownership is high and when weather is bad at their vacation homes.",['David Yermack'],"['Disclosure', 'Corporate jets', 'CEO vacations']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000920,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,2,David Yermack,2014,169.4662771250183
Politicians and the IPO decision: The impact of impending political promotions on IPO activity in China,"This paper shows that incentives created by the impending turnover of local politicians can accelerate the pace of initial public offering (IPO) activity in certain politicized environments. Focusing on China, we exploit a research setting where politicians are rewarded for capital market development, firms rely on political connections for access to capital, rent-seeking behavior is rampant, and the objectives of the state might not be to maximize capital market efficiency. We find that the rate of exchange eligible firms engaging in an IPO temporarily increases in advance of impending political promotion events. This effect holds for both state-owned and non-state-owned entities. For state-owned firms, the effect is strongest in those provinces where the politicians are more likely to be rewarded for market development activity. For non-state-owned firms, the temporary increase in IPO activity appears to be (rationally) opportunistic in nature, with the effect stronger around events more likely to disrupt the firms' political connections. Promotion period IPOs underperform non-promotion period IPOs in terms of both future financial performance and long-run stock returns, have controlling shareholders who retain a larger fraction of the company, and are more likely to divert proceeds away from their intended use after the offering.","['Joseph D.

Fact or friction: Jumps at ultra high frequency,"This paper shows that jumps in financial asset prices are often erroneously identified and are, in fact, rare events accounting for a very small proportion of the total price variation. We apply new econometric techniques to a comprehensive set of ultra high-frequency equity and foreign exchange tick data recorded at millisecond precision, allowing us to examine the price evolution at the individual order level. We show that in both theory and practice, traditional measures of jump variation based on lower-frequency data tend to spuriously assign a burst of volatility to the jump component. As a result, the true price variation coming from jumps is overstated. Our estimates based on tick data suggest that the jump variation is an order of magnitude smaller than typical estimates found in the existing literature.","['Kim Christensen', 'Roel C.A.

Shareholder democracy in play: Career consequences of proxy contests,"This paper shows that proxy contests have a significant adverse effect on careers of incumbent directors. Following a proxy contest, directors experience a significant decline in the number of directorships not only in the targeted company, but also in other nontargeted companies. The results are established using the universe of all proxy contests during 1996–2010. To isolate the effect of the proxy contest, our empirical strategy uses within-firm variation in directors׳ exposure to the possibility of being voted out and exploits the predetermined schedule of staggered boards that allows only a fraction of directors to be nominated for election every year. We find that nominated directors relative to non-nominated ones lose 58% more seats on other boards. The evidence suggests the proxy-contest mechanism imposes a significant career cost on incumbent directors.","['Vyacheslav Fos', 'Margarita Tsoutsoura']","['Proxy contests', 'Directors', 'Corporate governance', 'Agency problems']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001561,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,2,Vyacheslav Fos,2014,169.4662771250183
News-driven return reversals: Liquidity provision ahead of earnings announcements,"This study documents a six-fold increase in short-term return reversals during earnings announcements relative to non-announcement periods. Following prior research, we use reversals as a proxy for expected returns market makers demand for providing liquidity. Our findings highlight significant time-series variation in the magnitude of short-term return reversals and suggest that market makers demand higher expected returns prior to earnings announcements because of increased inventory risks that stem from holding net positions through the release of anticipated earnings news. Collectively, our findings suggest that uncertainty regarding anticipated information events elicits predictable increases in the compensation demanded for providing liquidity and that these increases significantly affect the dynamics and information content of market prices.","['Eric C.

Contrary to the empirical evidence of Easley, Hvidkjaer, and O׳Hara, but consistent with that of Duarte and Young (2009), we do not find that PIN exhibits a positive effect on a cross section of expected stock returns in international markets. Alternative information-based trading measures also display no effect on expected stock returns, corroborating our finding that information risk proxied by PIN, in general, has no pricing effect in world markets.","['Sandy Lai', 'Lilian Ng', 'Bohui Zhang']","['International markets', 'Information risk', 'PIN', 'Asset pricing']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001329,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,1,Sandy Lai,2014,169.4662771250183

We find little evidence of operating improvements subsequent to an LBO, although consistent with prior studies, we do observe operating improvements in the set of LBO firms that have public financial statements. We also find that firms do not reduce leverage after LBOs, even if they generate excess cash flow. Our results suggest that effecting a sustained change in capital structure is a conscious objective of the LBO structure.","['Jonathan B. Cohn', 'Lillian F. Mills', 'Erin M.

The death of the deal: Are withdrawn acquisition deals informative of CEO quality?,"To examine the market response to positive revelations of chief executive officer (CEO) quality, this study focuses on CEOs who withdraw acquisition bids when the price becomes increasingly expensive. Firms that withdrawal for price-related reasons earn higher withdrawal returns than firms that withdraw for other reasons. This relation is stronger when CEO uncertainty and discretion is high. CEOs unwilling to increase the offer price are less likely to be replaced and more likely to advance to a larger firm than a control group of CEOs. The finding that the market attaches value to CEO-specific information suggests that unobservable manager characteristics can meaningfully impact firm outcomes.",['Stacey Jacobsen'],"['Withdrawn mergers and acquisitions', 'CEO quality', 'Manager characteristics', 'CEO skill', 'Private benefits', 'Overconfidence', 'Monitoring', 'Turnover']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001263,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,1,Stacey Jacobsen,2014,169.4662771250183
Performance evaluation with high moments and disaster risk,"Traditional performance evaluation measures do not account for tail events and rare disasters. To address this issue, we reinterpret the riskiness measures of Aumann and Serrano (2008) and Foster and Hart (2009) as performance indices. We derive the moment properties of these indices and their sensitivity to rare disasters and show that they are consistent with the asset pricing literature. As applications, we show that “anomalous” investment strategies such as “momentum” or investment in private equity lose much of their glamour when accounting for high moments and rare events. Furthermore, using the indices to select mutual funds results in desirable high-moment properties out of sample.","['Ohad Kadan', 'Fang Liu']","['Performance evaluation', 'Rare disasters', 'High distribution moments']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000488,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,1,Ohad Kadan,2014,169.4662771250183
Debt covenant renegotiations and creditor control rights,"Using a large sample of private debt renegotiations from 1996 to 2011, we report that, even in the absence of any covenant violation, debt covenants are frequently renegotiated. These renegotiations primarily relax existing restrictions and result in economically large changes in existing limits. Renegotiations of specific covenants are a response to both the distance the covenant variable is from its contractual limit and the firm׳s specific operating conditions and prospects. Moreover, the borrower׳s post-renegotiation investment and financial policies are strongly associated with the covenant changes resulting from the renegotiation. Overall, the findings imply that, even outside of default states, creditors have strong control rights over the borrower׳s operating and financial policies, and they exercise these rights in a state contingent manner through covenant renegotiations.","['David J.

Macroeconomic effects of corporate default crisis: A long-term perspective,"Using an extensive data set on corporate bond defaults in the US from 1866 to 2010, we study the macroeconomic effects of bond market crises and contrast them with those resulting from banking crises. During the past 150 years, the US has experienced many severe corporate default crises in which 20–50% of all corporate bonds defaulted. Although the total par amount of corporate bonds has at times rivaled the amount of bank loans outstanding, we find that corporate default crises have far fewer real effects than do banking crises. These results provide empirical support for current theories that emphasize the unique role that banks and the credit and collateral channels play in amplifying macroeconomic shocks.","['Kay Giesecke', 'Francis A.

Networks and productivity: Causal evidence from editor rotations,"Using detailed publication and citation data for over 50,000 articles from 30 major economics and finance journals, we investigate whether network proximity to an editor influences research productivity. During an editor's tenure, his current university colleagues publish about 100% more papers in the editor's journal, compared to years when he is not editor. In contrast to editorial nepotism, such “inside” articles have significantly higher ex post citation counts, even when same-journal and self-cites are excluded. Our results thus suggest that despite potential conflicts of interest faced by editors, personal associations are used to improve selection decisions.","['Jonathan Brogaard', 'Joseph Engelberg', 'Christopher A.

Lévy jump risk: Evidence from options and returns,"Using index options and returns from 1996 to 2009, I estimate discrete-time models where asset returns follow a Brownian increment and a Lévy jump. Time variations in these models are generated with an affine GARCH, which facilitates the empirical implementation. I find that the risk premium implied by infinite-activity jumps contributes to more than half of the total equity premium and dominates that of the Brownian increments suggesting that it is more representative of the risks present in the economy. Overall, my findings suggest that infinite-activity jumps, instead of the Brownian increments, should be the default modeling choice in asset pricing models.",['Chayawat Ornthanalai'],"['Lévy process', 'Discrete-time', 'GARCH', 'Option valuation', 'Risk premium']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002985,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,1,Chayawat Ornthanalai,2014,169.4662771250183
"Safer ratios, riskier portfolios: Banks׳ response to government aid","Using novel data on bank applications to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), we study the effect of government assistance on bank risk taking. Bailed-out banks initiate riskier loans and shift assets toward riskier securities after receiving government support. However, this shift in risk occurs mostly within the same asset class and, therefore, remains undetected by regulatory capital ratios, which indicate improved capitalization at bailed-out banks. Consequently, these banks appear safer according to regulatory ratios, but show an increase in volatility and default risk. These findings are robust to controlling for credit demand and account for selection of TARP recipients by exploiting banks׳ geography-based political connections as an instrument for bailout approvals.","['Ran Duchin', 'Denis Sosyura']","['Bailout', 'TARP', 'Risk', 'Lending', 'Financial crisis', 'Moral hazard', 'Banking']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000476,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,1,Ran Duchin,2014,169.4662771250183
Are red or blue companies more likely to go green? Politics and corporate social responsibility,"Using the firm-level corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini, we find that firms score higher on CSR when they have Democratic rather than Republican founders, CEOs, and directors, and when they are headquartered in Democratic rather than Republican-leaning states. Democratic-leaning firms spend $20 million more on CSR than Republican-leaning firms ($80 million more within the sample of S&P 500 firms), or roughly 10% of net income. We find no evidence that firms recover these expenditures through increased sales. Indeed, increases in firm CSR ratings are associated with negative future stock returns and declines in firm ROA, suggesting that any benefits to stakeholders from social responsibility come at the direct expense of firm value.","['Alberta Di Giuli', 'Leonard Kostovetsky']","['Corporate social responsibility', 'Corporate culture', 'Politics']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002511,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,1,Alberta Di Giuli,2014,169.4662771250183
CEO deal-making activities and compensation,"Using transactions generally overlooked in the compensation literature—joint ventures, strategic alliances, seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), and spin-offs—we find that, beyond compensation for increases in firm size or complexity, chief executive officers (CEOs) are rewarded for their deal-making activities. Boards pay CEOs for the core motivation of the deal, as well as for deal volume. We find that compensating for volume instead of core value creation occurs under weak board monitoring and that in deal-making firms, neither CEO turnover nor pay-for-performance responds to underperformance. We introduce an input monitoring explanation for these results: boards compensate for deal volume because of their inability to perfectly monitor outputs.","['Eliezer M. Fich', 'Laura T.

"Composition of wealth, conditioning information, and the cross-section of stock returns","Value stocks covary with aggregate consumption more than growth stocks during periods when financial wealth is low relative to consumption. However, the conditional value premium does not exhibit such countercyclical behavior. Consequently, a one-factor conditional consumption-based asset pricing model can be rejected without making any arbitrary assumptions on the dynamics of the price of risk or the conditional moments. Empirical evidence is somewhat more consistent with a consumption-based model augmented with an aggregate wealth growth factor, which can be motivated by either recursive preferences or relative wealth concerns.",['Nikolai Roussanov'],"['Linear factor models', 'Conditioning information', 'Nonparametric estimation', 'Value premium', 'Relative wealth concerns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002729,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,2,Nikolai Roussanov,2014,169.4662771250183
Money and liquidity in financial markets,"We argue that there is a connection between the interbank market for liquidity and the broader financial markets, which has its basis in demand for liquidity by banks. Tightness in the market for liquidity leads banks to engage in what we term “liquidity pull-back,” which involves selling financial assets either by banks directly or by levered investors. Empirical tests on the stock market are supportive. Tighter interbank markets are associated with relatively more volume in more liquid stocks; selling pressure, especially in more liquid stocks; and transitory negative returns. We control for market-wide uncertainty and in the process also contribute to the literature on portfolio rebalancing. Our general point is that money matters in financial markets.","['Kjell G.

Countercyclical currency risk premia,"We describe a novel currency investment strategy, the ‘dollar carry trade,’ which delivers large excess returns, uncorrelated with the returns on well-known carry trade strategies. Using a no-arbitrage model of exchange rates we show that these excess returns compensate U.S. investors for taking on aggregate risk by shorting the dollar in bad times, when the U.S. price of risk is high. The countercyclical variation in risk premia leads to strong return predictability: the average forward discount and U.S. industrial production growth rates forecast up to 25% of the dollar return variation at the one-year horizon. The estimated model implies that the variation in the exposure of U.S. investors to worldwide risk is the key driver of predictability.","['Hanno Lustig', 'Nikolai Roussanov', 'Adrien Verdelhan']","['Exchange rates', 'Forecasting', 'Risk']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1300305X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,3,Hanno Lustig,2014,169.4662771250183
Monetary policy regimes: Implications for the yield curve and bond pricing,"We develop a multivariate dynamic term structure model, which takes into account the nonlinear (time-varying) relation between interest rates and the state of the economy. In contrast to the classical term structure literature, in which nonlinearities are captured by increasing the number of latent state variables or by latent regime shifts, in our no-arbitrage framework the regimes are governed by thresholds and are directly linked to economic fundamentals. Specifically, starting from a simple monetary policy model for the short rate, we introduce a parsimonious and tractable model for the yield curve, which takes into account the possibility of regime shifts in the behavior of the Federal Reserve. In our empirical analysis, we show the merit of our approach three dimensions: interpretable bond dynamics, accurate short end yield curve pricing, and yield curve implications.","['Kameliya Filipova', 'Francesco Audrino', 'Enrico De Giorgi']","['Threshold regime switching model', 'Macroeconomic variables', 'Term structure of interest rates', 'Asset pricing', 'Nonlinear dynamics', 'Business cycles']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1400110X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,3,Kameliya Filipova,2014,169.4662771250183
Speculating on home improvements,"We develop a speculation-based theory of home improvements. Housing services are produced from a mix of land and structures. Homeowners optimistic about future prices for these services speculate by making improvements, which we model as them increasing their structures holding fixed their land. The recoup value (the difference between the resale value of improvements and construction costs) is simultaneously increasing in home price appreciation and falls with construction cost growth. This prediction stands in contrast to a consumption-cum-financial constraints motive in which rising home prices loosen financial constraints and lead to lower recoup values. We provide evidence consistent with a speculative motive using data on the costs and recoup values of remodeling projects across US cities.","['Hyun-Soo Choi', 'Harrison Hong', 'Jose Scheinkman']","['Speculation', 'Home improvements', 'Real estate', 'Remodeling']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13003000,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,3,Hyun-Soo Choi,2014,169.4662771250183
"Preemptive bidding, target resistance, and takeover premiums","We evaluate empirically two sources of large takeover premiums: preemptive bidding and target resistance. We develop an auction model that features costly sequential entry of bidders in takeover contests and encompasses both explanations. We estimate the model parameters by simulated method of moments for a sample of US takeovers. Our estimates imply that target resistance explains the entire magnitude of the premium in 74% of successful single-bidder contests. Simulation experiments show that initial bidders have, on average, a higher valuation for the target than rival bidders, so that a relatively low initial bid is sufficient to deter a rival from entry.","['Theodosios Dimopoulos', 'Stefano Sacchetto']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Auctions', 'Target resistance', 'Preemptive bidding', 'Structural estimation']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001603,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,3,Theodosios Dimopoulos,2014,169.4662771250183
Limited partner performance and the maturing of the private equity industry,"We evaluate the performance of limited partners׳ (LPs׳) private equity investments over time. Using a sample of 14,380 investments by 1,852 LPs in 1,250 buyout and venture capital funds started between 1991 and 2006, we find that the superior performance of endowment investors in the 1991–1998 period, documented by prior literature, is mostly due to their greater access to the top-performing venture capital partnerships. In the subsequent 1999–2006 period, endowments no longer outperform, no longer have greater access to funds that are likely to restrict access, and do not make better investment selections than other types of institutional investors. Nevertheless, all investor types׳ private equity investments continue to outperform public markets on average. We discuss how these results are consistent with the general maturing of the industry, as private equity has transitioned from a niche, poorly understood area to a ubiquitous part of institutional investors׳ portfolios.","['Berk A.

Freedom of choice between unitary and two-tier boards: An empirical analysis,"We examine board structure in France, which since 1966 has allowed firms the freedom to choose between unitary and two-tier boards. We analyze how this choice relates to characteristics of the firm and its environment. Firms with severe asymmetric information tend to opt for unitary boards; firms with a potential for private benefits extraction tend to adopt two-tier boards. Chief executive officer turnover is more sensitive to performance at firms with two-tier boards, indicating greater monitoring. Our results are broadly consistent with the Adams and Ferreira (2007) model and suggest that gains result from allowing freedom of contract about board structure.","['François Belot', 'Edith Ginglinger', 'Myron B.

The role of investment banker directors in M&A,"We examine how directors with investment banking experience affect firms׳ acquisition behavior. We find that firms with investment bankers on the board have a higher probability of making acquisitions. Furthermore, acquirers with investment banker directors experience higher announcement returns, pay lower takeover premiums and advisory fees, and exhibit superior long-run performance. Overall, our results suggest that directors with investment banking experience help firms make better acquisitions, both by identifying suitable targets and by reducing the cost of the deals.","['Qianqian Huang', 'Feng Jiang', 'Erik Lie', 'Ke Yang']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Board of directors', 'Investment banking experience']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1400021X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,2,Qianqian Huang,2014,169.4662771250183
Financial development and innovation: Cross-country evidence,"We examine how financial market development affects technological innovation. Using a large data set that includes 32 developed and emerging countries and a fixed effects identification strategy, we identify economic mechanisms through which the development of equity markets and credit markets affects technological innovation. We show that industries that are more dependent on external finance and that are more high-tech intensive exhibit a disproportionally higher innovation level in countries with better developed equity markets. However, the development of credit markets appears to discourage innovation in industries with these characteristics. Our paper provides new insights into the real effects of financial market development on the economy.","['Po-Hsuan Hsu', 'Xuan Tian', 'Yan Xu']","['Financial development', 'Innovation', 'External finance dependence', 'High-tech intensiveness']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13003024,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,1,Po-Hsuan Hsu,2014,169.4662771250183
The determinants of recovery rates in the US corporate bond market,"We examine recovery rates of defaulted bonds in the US corporate bond market, based on a complete set of traded prices and volumes. A study of the trading microstructure around various types of default events is provided. We document temporary price pressure with high trading volumes on the default day and the following 30 days, and low trading activity thereafter.

Access to management and the informativeness of analyst research,"We examine whether access to management at broker-hosted investor conferences leads to more informative research by analysts. We find analyst recommendation changes have larger immediate price impacts when the analyst׳s firm has a conference-hosting relation with the company. The effect increases with hosting frequency and is strongest in the days following the conference. Conference-hosting brokers also issue more informative, accurate, and timely earnings forecasts than non-hosts. Our findings suggest that access to management remains an important source of analysts׳ informational advantage in the post-Regulation Fair Disclosure world.","['T.

Managerial risk taking incentives and corporate pension policy,"We examine whether the compensation incentives of top management affect the extent of risk shifting versus risk management behavior in pension plans. We find that risk shifting through pension underfunding (and, to a lesser extent, through pension asset allocation to risky securities) is stronger with compensation structures that create high wealth-risk sensitivity (vega) and weaker with high wealth-price sensitivity (delta). These findings are stronger for chief financial officers (CFOs) than for chief executive officers (CEOs), suggesting that pension policy falls within the CFO’s domain. Risk shifting through pension underfunding is also lower when the CFO’s personal stake in the pension plan is larger. Overall, these findings show that top managers’ compensation structure is an important driver of corporate pension policy. They also highlight firms within which the moral hazard concerns fueled by Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insurance are most relevant.","['Divya Anantharaman', 'Yong Gyu Lee']","['Defined benefit pensions', 'Risk shifting', 'Executive compensation', 'Incentives']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002717,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,2,Divya Anantharaman,2014,169.4662771250183
Income hedging and portfolio decisions,"We examine whether the decision to participate in the stock market and other related portfolio decisions are influenced by income hedging motives. Economic theory predicts that the market participation propensity should increase as the correlation between income growth and stock market returns decreases. Surprisingly, empirical studies find limited support for the income hedging motive. Using a rich, unique Dutch data set and the National Longitudinal Survey of the Youth (NLSY) from the United States, we show that when the income-return correlation is low, individuals exhibit a greater propensity to participate in the market and allocate a larger proportion of their wealth to risky assets. Even when the income risk is high, individuals exhibit a higher propensity to participate in the market when the hedging potential is high. These findings suggest that income hedging is an important determinant of stock market participation and asset allocation decisions.","['Yosef Bonaparte', 'George M.

Accountability of independent directors: Evidence from firms subject to securities litigation,"We examine which independent directors are held accountable when investors sue firms for financial and disclosure-related fraud. Investors can name independent directors as defendants in lawsuits, and they can vote against their reelection to express displeasure over the directors’ ineffectiveness at monitoring managers. In a sample of securities class action lawsuits from 1996 to 2010, about 11% of independent directors are named as defendants. The likelihood of being named is greater for audit committee members and directors who sell stock during the class period. Named directors receive more negative recommendations from Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm, and significantly more negative votes from shareholders than directors in a benchmark sample. They are also more likely than other independent directors to leave sued firms. Overall, shareholders use litigation along with director elections and director retention to hold some independent directors more accountable than others when firms experience financial fraud.","['Francois Brochet', 'Suraj Srinivasan']","['Independent directors', 'Director reputation', 'Accountability', 'Securities litigation', 'Shareholder voting']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002754,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,2,Francois Brochet,2014,169.4662771250183
"Elections, political competition and bank failure","We exploit exogenous variation in the scheduling of gubernatorial elections to study the timing of bank failure in the US. Using hazard analysis, we show that bank failure is about 45% less likely in the year leading up to an election. Political control (i.e., lack of competition) can explain all of this average election year fall in the hazard rate. In particular, we show that the reduction in hazard rate doubles in magnitude for banks operating in states where the governor has simultaneous control of the upper and lower houses of the state legislature (i.e., complete control) heading into an election.","['Wai-Man Liu', 'Phong T.H.

Did bank distress stifle innovation during the Great Depression?,"We find a negative relationship between bank distress and the level, quality and trajectory of firm-level innovation during the Great Depression, particularly for R&D firms operating in capital intensive industries. However, we also show that because a sufficient number of R&D intensive firms were located in counties with lower levels of bank distress, or were operating in less capital intensive industries, the negative effects were mitigated in aggregate. Although Depression era bank distress was associated with the stifling of innovation, our results also help to explain why technological development was still robust following one of the largest shocks in the history of the U.S. banking system.","['Ramana Nanda', 'Tom Nicholas']","['Great Depression', 'Patents', 'R&D', 'Bank distress']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001536,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,2,Ramana Nanda,2014,169.4662771250183
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder: The effect of corporate tax avoidance on the cost of bank loans,"We find that firms with greater tax avoidance incur higher spreads when obtaining bank loans. This finding is robust in a battery of sensitivity analyses and in two quasi-experimental settings including the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 and the revelation of past tax sheltering activity. Firms with greater tax avoidance also incur more stringent nonprice loan terms, incur higher at-issue bond spreads, and prefer bank loans over public bonds when obtaining debt financing. Overall, these findings indicate that banks perceive tax avoidance as engendering significant risks.","['Iftekhar Hasan', 'Chun Keung (Stan) Hoi', 'Qiang Wu', 'Hao Zhang']","['Tax avoidance', 'Cost of bank loans', 'Information risk', 'Agency risk', 'FIN 48']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000464,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,1,Iftekhar Hasan,2014,169.4662771250183
Did going public impair Moody׳s credit ratings?,"We investigate a prominent allegation in congressional hearings that Moody׳s loosened its rating standards to chase revenue after it went public in 2000. Consistent with this allegation, Moody׳s ratings for both corporate bonds and structured finance products are significantly more favorable to issuers, relative to S&P׳s, after Moody׳s IPO. Moreover, Moody׳s ratings are more favorable for clients subject to greater conflict of interest. There is little evidence that Moody׳s higher ratings, post-IPO, are more informative, measured as expected default frequencies (EDFs) or as the probability of default.

For a sample of 1,492 NYSE stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales. Furthermore, during the operative period of a Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) order mandating stock borrowing prior to short sales, the securities affected display relatively lower liquidity and higher pricing errors. Finally, we do not find any evidence that FTDs caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis.","['Veljko Fotak', 'Vikas Raman', 'Pradeep K.

Price informativeness and stock return synchronicity: Evidence from the pricing of seasoned equity offerings,"We investigate what stock return synchronicity reflects in terms of price informativeness by examining its effect on the pricing of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Based on 5,087 SEOs from 1984 to 2007, we find a significantly negative relation between stock return synchronicity (estimated as the logit transformation of the R-squared statistic from a two-factor regression) and SEO discounts (the percentage differences between pre-offer day closing prices and offer prices). The negative relation is strongest when there is no analyst coverage, and it declines as analyst coverage increases. This shows that stock price is more informative when stock return synchronicity is higher and also that information asymmetry can be mitigated by analyst coverage. We further decompose stock return synchronicity into the market comovement and industry comovement components and find that both components are equally important in affecting SEO discounts.","['Kalok Chan', 'Yue-Cheong Chan']","['Seasoned equity offerings', 'Stock return synchronicity', 'Price informativeness']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1400138X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,1,Kalok Chan,2014,169.4662771250183
Predatory lending and the subprime crisis,"We measure the effect of a 2006 antipredatory pilot program in Chicago on mortgage default rates to test whether predatory lending was a key element in fueling the subprime crisis. Under the program, risky borrowers or risky mortgage contracts or both triggered review sessions by housing counselors who shared their findings with the state regulator. The pilot program cut market activity in half, largely through the exit of lenders specializing in risky loans and through a decline in the share of subprime borrowers. Our results suggest that predatory lending practices contributed to high mortgage default rates among subprime borrowers, raising them by about a third.","['Sumit Agarwal', 'Gene Amromin', 'Itzhak Ben-David', 'Souphala Chomsisengphet', 'Douglas D.

Betting against beta,"We present a model with leverage and margin constraints that vary across investors and time. We find evidence consistent with each of the model's five central predictions: (1) Because constrained investors bid up high-beta assets, high beta is associated with low alpha, as we find empirically for US equities, 20 international equity markets, Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and futures. (2) A betting against beta (BAB) factor, which is long leveraged low-beta assets and short high-beta assets, produces significant positive risk-adjusted returns. (3) When funding constraints tighten, the return of the BAB factor is low. (4) Increased funding liquidity risk compresses betas toward one. (5) More constrained investors hold riskier assets.","['Andrea Frazzini', 'Lasse Heje Pedersen']","['Asset prices', 'Leverage constraints', 'Margin requirements', 'Liquidity', 'Beta', 'CAPM']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002675,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,1,Andrea Frazzini,2014,169.4662771250183
Dispersion in beliefs among active mutual funds and the cross-section of stock returns,"We propose a measure of dispersion in fund managers׳ beliefs about future stock returns based on their active holdings, i.e., deviations from benchmarks. We find that both the level of and the change in dispersion positively predict subsequent stock returns on a risk-adjusted basis. This effect is particularly pronounced among stocks with high information asymmetry and binding short-sale constraints. These results suggest that a subgroup of informed managers drives up the dispersion in active holdings when they place large bets after receiving positive private information. Binding short-sale constraints, however, prevent them from fully using their negative private information, leading to low dispersion in active holdings.","['Hao Jiang', 'Zheng Sun']","['Mutual funds', 'Private information', 'Dispersion in beliefs', 'Short-sale constraints', 'Asymmetric information']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001305,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,2,Hao Jiang,2014,169.4662771250183
Forecasting stock returns under economic constraints,"We propose a new approach to imposing economic constraints on time series forecasts of the equity premium. Economic constraints are used to modify the posterior distribution of the parameters of the predictive return regression in a way that better allows the model to learn from the data. We consider two types of constraints: non-negative equity premia and bounds on the conditional Sharpe ratio, the latter of which incorporates time-varying volatility in the predictive regression framework. Empirically, we find that economic constraints systematically reduce uncertainty about model parameters, reduce the risk of selecting a poor forecasting model, and improve both statistical and economic measures of out-of-sample forecast performance.","['Davide Pettenuzzo', 'Allan Timmermann', 'Rossen Valkanov']","['Economic constraints', 'Sharpe ratio', 'Equity premium predictions']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001627,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,3,Davide Pettenuzzo,2014,169.4662771250183
Time-changed Lévy LIBOR market model: Pricing and joint estimation of the cap surface and swaption cube,"We propose a novel time-changed Lévy LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) market model for jointly pricing of caps and swaptions. The time changes are split into three components. The first component allows matching the volatility term structure, the second generates stochastic volatility, and the third accommodates for stochastic skew. The parsimonious model is flexible enough to accommodate the behavior of both caps and swaptions. For the joint estimation we use a comprehensive data set spanning the financial crisis of 2007–2010. We find that, even during this period, neither market is as fragmented as suggested by the previous literature.","['Markus Leippold', 'Jacob Strømberg']","['LIBOR market models', 'Time-changed Lévy process', 'Caps volatilities', 'Swaption cube', 'Unscented Kalman filter']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002304,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,1,Markus Leippold,2014,169.4662771250183
Mutual fund performance evaluation with active peer benchmarks,"We propose a simple approach to account for commonalities in mutual fund strategies that relies solely on information on fund returns and investment objectives. Our approach augments commonly used factor models with an additional benchmark that represents an equal investment in all same-category funds, which we call an active peer benchmark (APB). We find that APBs substantially reduce the average time series correlation of residuals between individual funds within a group when added to a four-factor equity model (or to a seven-factor fixed-income model).

Credit lines as monitored liquidity insurance: Theory and evidence,"We propose a theory of credit lines provided by banks to firms as a form of monitored liquidity insurance. Bank monitoring and resulting revocations help control illiquidity-seeking behavior of firms insured by credit lines. The cost of credit lines is thus greater for firms with high liquidity risk, which in turn are likely to use cash instead of credit lines. We test this implication for corporate liquidity management by identifying exogenous shocks to liquidity risk of firms in corporate bond and equity markets. Firms experiencing increases in liquidity risk move out of credit lines and into cash holdings.","['Viral Acharya', 'Heitor Almeida', 'Filippo Ippolito', 'Ander Perez']","['Liquidity management', 'Cash holdings', 'Liquidity risk', 'Hedging', 'Covenants', 'Loan commitments', 'Credit line revocation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000191,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,3,Viral Acharya,2014,169.4662771250183
"Investment busts, reputation, and the temptation to blend in with the crowd","We provide a real-options model of an industry in which agents time abandonment of their projects in an effort to protect their reputations. Agents delay abandonment attempting to signal quality. When a public common shock forces abandonment of a small fraction of projects irrespective of agents' quality, many agents abandon their projects strategically even if they are unaffected by the shock. Such “blending in with the crowd” effect creates an additional incentive to delay abandonment ahead of the shock, leading to accumulation of “living dead” projects, which further amplifies the shock. The potential for moderate public common shocks often improves agents' values.","['Steven R. Grenadier', 'Andrey Malenko', 'Ilya A.

In contrast, we find that at times when firms are at or close to their optimal level of leverage, the cross-sectional correlation between profitability and leverage is positive. At other times, it is negative. These results are consistent with dynamic trade-off models in which infrequent capital structure rebalancing is optimal. The time series of market leverage and profitability in the quarters prior to rebalancing events match the patterns predicted by these models.

Asset pricing: A tale of two days,"We show that asset prices behave very differently on days when important macroeconomic news is scheduled for announcement. In addition to significantly higher average returns for risky assets on announcement days, return patterns are much easier to reconcile with standard asset pricing theories, both cross-sectionally and over time. On such days, stock market beta is strongly related to average returns. This positive relation holds for individual stocks, for various test portfolios, and even for bonds and currencies, suggesting that beta is after all an important measure of systematic risk. Furthermore, a robust risk–return trade-off exists on announcement days. Expected variance is positively related to future aggregated quarterly announcement day returns, but not to aggregated non-announcement day returns.

Fund Manager Allocation,"We show that fund families allocate their most skilled managers to market segments in which manager skill is rewarded best. In efficient markets, even skilled managers cannot generate excess returns. In less efficient markets, skilled managers can exploit inefficiencies and generate higher performance than unskilled managers. Fund families seem to be aware of the relation between skill, efficiency, and performance, and allocate more skilled managers to inefficient markets. They pursue this strategy when hiring new fund managers and when reassigning managers to funds within the family.

Crises and confidence: Systemic banking crises and depositor behavior,"We show that individuals who have experienced a systemic banking crisis are 11 percentage points less likely to use banks in the U.S. than otherwise similar individuals who emigrated from the same country but did not live through a crisis. This finding is robust to controlling for exposure to other macroeconomic events and to various methods for addressing potential bias due to migrant self-selection. Consistent with the view that personal experience plays an important role in decision-making, the effects are larger for individuals who were older and more likely to have had wealth entrusted to the banking system at the time of the crisis and for people who experienced crises in countries without deposit insurance.","['Una Okonkwo Osili', 'Anna Paulson']","['Systemic banking crises', 'Confidence', 'Deposit insurance', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Immigrants']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002791,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,111,3,Una Okonkwo Osili,2014,169.4662771250183
Winners in the spotlight: Media coverage of fund holdings as a driver of flows,"We show that media coverage of mutual fund holdings affects how investors allocate money across funds. Fund holdings with high past returns attract extra flows, but only if these stocks were recently featured in the media. In contrast, holdings that were not covered in major newspapers do not affect flows.

The internal capital markets of business groups: Evidence from intra-group loans,"We study business groups׳ internal capital markets using a unique data set on intra-group lending in Chile (1990–2009). In line with groups׳ financing advantage, firms that borrow internally have higher investment, leverage, and return on equity (ROE) than other firms. At the margin, controlling shareholders have higher cash-flow rights in borrowing firms than in lending firms. However, there is no robust evidence of minority shareholders losing out from intra-group loans as tunneling predicts. Our evidence is consistent with the idea that strict regulation and disclosure requirements for intra-group loans, which are features of the Chilean market, reduce the risk of expropriation in pyramids.","['David Buchuk', 'Borja Larrain', 'Francisco Muñoz', 'Francisco Urzúa I.']","['Business groups', 'Pyramids', 'Internal capital markets', 'Intra-group loans', 'Cash-flow rights']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000178,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,2,David Buchuk,2014,169.4662771250183
Financial expert CEOs: CEO׳s work experience and firm׳s financial policies,"We study CEOs with a career background in finance. Firms with financial expert CEOs hold less cash, more debt, and engage in more share repurchases. Financial expert CEOs are more financially sophisticated: they are less likely to use one companywide discount rate instead of a project-specific one, they manage financial policies more actively, and their firm investments are less sensitive to cash flows. Financial expert CEOs are able to raise external funds even when credit conditions are tight, and they were more responsive to the dividend and capital gains tax cuts in 2003. Analyzing CEO-firm matching based on financial experience, we find that financial expert CEOs tend to be hired by more mature firms. Our results are consistent with employment histories of CEOs being relevant for corporate policies. However, we cannot formally rule out that our findings are partly explained by endogenous CEO-firm matching.","['Cláudia Custódio', 'Daniel Metzger']","['CEO employment history', 'CEOs characteristics', 'Financial expertise', 'Cash holdings', 'Capital structure', 'CEO-firm matching']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001299,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,1,Cláudia Custódio,2014,169.4662771250183
Price pressures,"We study price pressures, i.e., deviations from the efficient price due to risk-averse intermediaries supplying liquidity to asynchronously arriving investors. Empirically, New York Stock Exchange intermediary data reveals economically large price pressures, 0.49% on average with a half life of 0.92 days. Theoretically, a simple dynamic inventory model captures an intermediary׳s use of price pressure to mean-revert inventory. She trades off revenue loss due to price pressure against price risk associated with staying in a nonzero inventory state. The closed-form solution identifies the intermediary׳s risk aversion and the investors׳ private value distribution from the observed time series patterns of prices and inventories. These parameters imply a relative social cost due to price pressure, a deviation from constrained Pareto efficiency, of approximately 10% of the cost of immediacy.","['Terrence Hendershott', 'Albert J.

Independent director incentives: Where do talented directors spend their limited time and energy?,"We study reputation incentives in the director labor market and find that directors with multiple directorships distribute their effort unequally based on the directorship's relative prestige. When directors experience an exogenous increase in a directorship's relative ranking, their board attendance rate increases and subsequent firm performance improves. Also, directors are less willing to relinquish their relatively more prestigious directorships, even when firm performance declines. Finally, forced Chief Executive Officer departure sensitivity to poor performance rises when a larger fraction of independent directors view the board as relatively more prestigious. We conclude that director reputation is a powerful incentive for independent directors.","['Ronald W.

The euro and corporate financing before the crisis,"We study the financing policies of European public corporations prior to the euro crisis. Using data from 11 euro countries and a control group of five other European countries over 1991–2006, we show that nonfinancial firms from euro countries with previously weak currencies considerably increased their debt financing after the introduction of the euro. The results are stronger for large firms, firms dependent on external financing, and for the latter part of the post-euro time period. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that the supply of capital increased following the introduction of the euro.","['Arturo Bris', 'Yrjö Koskinen', 'Mattias Nilsson']","['Euro', 'Financial integration', 'External financing', 'Debt financing', 'Supply of capital', 'Financial dependence']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001652,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,114,3,Arturo Bris,2014,169.4662771250183
Board composition and CEO power,"We study the optimal composition of corporate boards. Directors can be either monitoring or advisory types. Monitoring constrains the empire-building tendency of chief executive officers (CEOs). If shareholders control the board nomination process, a non-monotonic relation ensues between agency problems and board composition. To preempt CEO entrenchment, shareholders may assemble an adviser-heavy board. If a powerful CEO influences the nomination process, this may result in a more monitor-heavy board. Regulations strengthening the monitoring role of boards can be harmful in precisely those cases in which agency problems are severe or in which CEO entrenchment is a threat to corporate governance.","['Tim Baldenius', 'Nahum Melumad', 'Xiaojing Meng']","['Corporate governance', 'CEO power', 'Board composition']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002663,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,1,Tim Baldenius,2014,169.4662771250183

Comovement and investment banking networks,"We test the hypothesis that investment banking networks affect stock prices and trading behavior. Consistent with the notion that investment banks serve as information hubs for segmented groups of investors, the stock prices of firms that use the same lead underwriter during their equity offerings tend to move together. We also find that when firms switch underwriters between their initial public offering (IPO) and a seasoned equity offering (SEO), they comove less with the stocks associated with the old bank and more with the stocks associated with the new bank. This change in comovement is greater for stocks completing their first SEO and for those experiencing large changes in institutional ownership.","['Gustavo Grullon', 'Shane Underwood', 'James P.

The international transmission of bank capital requirements: Evidence from the UK,"We use data on UK banks׳ minimum capital requirements to study the impact of changes to bank-specific capital requirements on cross-border bank loan supply from 1999Q1 to 2006Q4. By examining a sample in which each recipient country has multiple relationships with UK-resident banks, we are able to control for demand effects. We find a negative and statistically significant effect of changes to banks׳ capital requirements on cross-border lending: a 100 basis point increase in the requirement is associated with a reduction in the growth rate of cross-border credit of 5.5 percentage points. We also find that banks tend to favor their most important country relationships, so that the negative cross-border credit supply response in “core” countries is significantly less than in others. Banks tend to cut back cross-border credit to other banks (including foreign affiliates) more than to firms and households, consistent with shorter maturity, wholesale lending which is easier to roll off and may be associated with weaker borrowing relationships.","['Shekhar Aiyar', 'Charles W.

Dynamic debt runs and financial fragility: Evidence from the 2007 ABCP crisis,"We use the 2007 asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) crisis as a laboratory to study the determinants of debt runs. Our model features dilution risk: maturing short-term lenders demand higher yields in compensation for being diluted by future lenders, making runs more likely. The model explains the observed tenfold increase in yield spreads leading to runs and the positive relation between yield spreads and future runs. Results from structural estimation show that runs are very sensitive to leverage, asset values, and asset liquidity, but less sensitive to the degree of maturity mismatch, the strength of guarantees, and asset volatility.","['Enrique Schroth', 'Gustavo A.

Distracted directors: Does board busyness hurt shareholder value?,"We use the deaths of directors and chief executive officers as a natural experiment to generate exogenous variation in the time and resources available to independent directors at interlocked firms. The loss of such key co-employees is an attention shock because it increases the board committee workload only for some interlocked directors—the ‘treatment group’. There is a negative stock market reaction to attention shocks only for treated director-interlocked firms. Interlocking directors׳ busyness, the importance of their board roles, and their degree of independence magnify the treatment effect. Overall, directors׳ busyness is detrimental to board monitoring quality and shareholder value.","['Antonio Falato', 'Dalida Kadyrzhanova', 'Ugur Lel']","['Busy directors', 'Multiple directorship', 'Firm valuation', 'Independent directors', 'Director and CEO death']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001093,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,113,3,Antonio Falato,2014,169.4662771250183
"Who works for startups? The relation between firm age, employee age, and growth","Young firms disproportionately employ and hire young workers. On average, young employees in young firms earn higher wages than young employees in older firms. Young employees disproportionately join young firms with greater innovation potential and that exhibit higher growth, conditional on survival. We argue that the skills, risk tolerance, and joint dynamics of young workers contribute to their disproportionate share of employment in young firms. Moreover, an increase in the supply of young workers is positively related to new firm creation in high-tech industries, supporting a causal link between the supply of young workers and new firm creation.","['Paige Ouimet', 'Rebecca Zarutskie']","['Firm age', 'Employee age', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Wages', 'Venture capital']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000452,Journal of Financial Economics,0.7384019017998708,112,3,Paige Ouimet,2014,169.4662771250183
Diagnosing affine models of options pricing: Evidence from VIX,"Affine jump-diffusion models have been the mainstream in options pricing because of their analytical tractability. Popular affine jump-diffusion models, however, are still unsatisfactory in describing the options data and the problem is often attributed to the diffusion term of the unobserved state variables. Using prices of variance-swaps (i.e., squared VIX) implied from options prices, we provide fresh evidence regarding the misspecification of affine jump-diffusion models, as variance-swap prices are affine functions of the state variables in a broader class of models that do not restrict the diffusion term of the state variables. We apply the nonparametric methodology used by Aït-Sahalia (1996b), supplemented with bootstrap tests and other parametric tests, to the S&P 500 index options data from January 1996 to September 2008. We find that, while the affine diffusion term of the state variables may contribute to the misspecification as the literature has suggested, the affine drift of the state variables, jump intensities, and risk premiums are also sources of misspecification.","['Gang Li', 'Chu Zhang']","['Options pricing', 'Affine jump-diffusion models', 'Variance-swap prices']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001651,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,1,Gang Li,2013,169.3821329953634
The effects of firm-initiated clawback provisions on bank loan contracting,"Although firm-initiated clawbacks reduce accounting manipulation, they also induce managers to engage in suboptimal activities (e.g., reduce research and development (R&D) expenses) to achieve earnings targets. To assess the effectiveness of clawback provisions, we examine their impact from debtholders' point of view. We find that banks use more financial covenants and performance pricing provisions in the loan contracts and decrease interest rates after firms initiate clawbacks. Moreover, we also find that loan maturity increases and loan collateral decreases subsequent to clawback adoption. Taken together, our findings indicate that firm-initiated clawback provisions enhance financial reporting quality, thereby reducing the information uncertainty that financing providers face.","['Lilian H.

"Style investing, comovement and return predictability","Barberis and Shleifer (2003) argue that style investing generates momentum and reversals in style and individual asset returns, as well as comovement between individual assets and their styles. Consistent with these predictions, in some specifications, past style returns help explain future stock returns after controlling for size, book-to-market and past stock returns. We also use comovement to identify style investing and assess its impact on momentum. High comovement momentum portfolios have significantly higher future returns than low comovement momentum portfolios.

Do personal taxes affect capital structure? Evidence from the 2003 tax cut,"Because the personal tax treatments of interest and dividend income likely affect the relative cost of debt and equity financing, a sharp change in tax treatment could affect firms' optimal leverage. This paper examines the effect of the 2003 equity income tax cut on firms' debt usage. Because this tax cut affected only individual investors, we can use a difference-in-differences method to identify the effect of personal tax on firms' leverage. Previous research has found that the 2003 tax cut encouraged dividend payouts and reduced the cost of equity, but it provides no link to equilibrium leverage ratios. We estimate that the tax cut causes the affected firms' leverage to decrease by about 5 percentage points. Furthermore, we show that the effects of the tax cut are stronger for firms with lower marginal corporate tax rates and for firms that are not financially constrained, consistent with our theoretical predictions. Overall, we find strong evidence that personal tax is an important determinant of firms' optimal leverage.","['Leming Lin', 'Mark J.

Are busy boards detrimental?,"Busy directors have been widely criticized as being ineffective. However, we hypothesize that busy directors offer advantages for many firms. While busy directors may be less effective monitors, their experience and contacts arguably make them excellent advisors. Among IPO firms, which have minimal experience with public markets and likely rely heavily on their directors for advising, we find busy boards to be common and to contribute positively to firm value. Moreover, these positive effects of busy boards extend to all but the most established firms. Benefits are lowest among Forbes 500 firms, which likely require more monitoring than advising.","['Laura Field', 'Michelle Lowry', 'Anahit Mkrtchyan']","['Corporate Governance', 'Board of Directors', 'Initial public offerings', 'Venture capital']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000470,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,1,Laura Field,2013,169.3821329953634
Ratings quality over the business cycle,"Credit rating agencies (CRAs) have long held that reputational concerns discipline their behavior. The value of reputation, however, depends on economic fundamentals that vary over the business cycle. In a model of ratings incorporating endogenous reputation and a market environment that varies, we find that ratings quality is countercyclical. Specifically, a CRA is more likely to issue less-accurate ratings when fee-income is high, competition in the labor market for analysts is tough, and securities' default probabilities are low. Persistence in economic conditions can diminish our results, while mean reversion exacerbates them. The presence of naive investors reduces overall quality, but quality remains countercyclical. Finally, we demonstrate that competition among CRAs yields similar results.","['Heski Bar-Isaac', 'Joel Shapiro']","['Credit rating agencies', 'Reputation', 'Ratings accuracy']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002395,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,1,Heski Bar-Isaac,2013,169.3821329953634
Peer choice in CEO compensation,"Current research shows that firms are more likely to benchmark against peers that pay their Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) higher compensation, reflecting self serving behavior.

Consistent with our prediction, we find that the association between a firm's selection of highly paid peers and CEO pay mostly represents compensation for CEO talent.","['Ana M.

"Access to capital, investment, and the financial crisis","During the recent financial crisis, corporate borrowing and capital expenditures fall sharply. Most existing research links the two phenomena by arguing that a shock to bank lending (or, more generally, to the corporate credit supply) caused a reduction in capital expenditures. The economic significance of this causal link is tenuous, as we find that (1) bank-dependent firms do not decrease capital expenditures more than matching firms in the first year of the crisis or in the two quarters after Lehman Brother's bankruptcy; (2) firms that are unlevered before the crisis decrease capital expenditures during the crisis as much as matching firms and, proportionately, more than highly levered firms; (3) the decrease in net debt issuance for bank-dependent firms is not greater than for matching firms; (4) the average cumulative decrease in net equity issuance is more than twice the average decrease in net debt issuance from the start of the crisis through March 2009; and (5) bank-dependent firms hoard cash during the crisis compared with unlevered firms.","['Kathleen M.

"Boards, CEO entrenchment, and the cost of capital","Existing research on chief executive officer (CEO) turnover focuses on CEO ability. This paper argues that board ability is also important.

Entrenchment in this model does not result from CEO power, or from agency problems. Entrenchment is mitigated when there are more assets-in-place relative to investment opportunities. The paper also compares public and private equity. Private ownership eliminates CEO entrenchment, but market signals improve investment decisions.

Reputational contagion and optimal regulatory forbearance,"Existing studies suggest that systemic crises may arise because banks either hold correlated assets, or are connected by interbank lending. This paper shows that common regulation is also a conduit for interbank contagion. One bank's failure may undermine confidence in the banking regulator's competence, and, hence, in other banks chartered by the same regulator. As a result, depositors withdraw funds from otherwise unconnected banks. The optimal regulatory response to this behavior can be privately to exhibit forbearance to a failing bank.

The valuation model establishes that the comparative static relation between expected returns and expected investment is negative, yet it appears to be positive and insignificant.

U.S. IPO activity does not benefit from financial globalization. Compared to other countries, the rate of small-firm IPO activity in the U.S. is abnormally low in the 2000s.

The economics of hedge funds,"Hedge fund managers trade off the benefits of leveraging on the alpha-generating strategy against the costs of inefficient fund liquidation. In contrast to the standard risk-seeking intuition, even with a constant-return-to-scale alpha-generating strategy, a risk-neutral manager becomes endogenously risk-averse and decreases leverage following poor performance to increase the fund's survival likelihood. Our calibration suggests that management fees are the majority of the total compensation. Money flows, managerial restart options, and management ownership increase the importance of high-water-mark-based incentive fees but management fees remain the majority. Investors' valuation of fees are highly sensitive to their assessments of the manager's skill.","['Yingcong Lan', 'Neng Wang', 'Jinqiang Yang']","['High-water mark (HWM)', 'Alpha', 'Management fees', 'Incentive fees', 'Liquidation risk', 'New money flow']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001621,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,2,Yingcong Lan,2013,169.3821329953634
Laying off credit risk: Loan sales versus credit default swaps,"How do markets for debt cash flow rights, with and without accompanying control rights, affect the efficiency of lending? A bank makes a loan, learns if it needs monitoring, and then decides whether to lay off credit risk. The bank can transfer credit risk by either selling the loan or buying a credit default swap (CDS). With a CDS, the originating bank retains the loan's control rights; with loan sales, control rights pass to the loan buyer. Credit risk transfer leads to excessive monitoring of riskier credits and insufficient monitoring of safer credits. Increases in banks' cost of equity capital exacerbate these effects. For riskier credits, loan sales typically dominate CDS but not for safer credits. Once repeated lending and consequent reputation concerns are modeled, although CDSs remain dominated by loan sales for riskier credits, for safer credits they can dominate loan sales, supporting better monitoring (albeit to a limited extent) while allowing efficient risk sharing. Restrictions on the bank's ability to sell the loan expand the range in which CDSs are used and monitoring is too low.","['Christine A.

The acquisitiveness of youth: CEO age and acquisition behavior,"I demonstrate that acquisitions are accompanied by large, permanent increases in Chief Executive Officer (CEO) compensation, which create strong financial incentives for CEOs to pursue acquisitions earlier in their career. Accordingly, I document that a firm's acquisition propensity is decreasing in the age of its CEO: a firm with a CEO who is 20 years older is ∼30% less likely to announce an acquisition. This negative effect of CEO age on acquisitions is strongest among firms where CEOs likely anticipate or can influence high post-acquisition compensation, and is absent for other investment decisions that are not rewarded with permanent compensation gains. The age effect cannot be explained by the selection of young CEOs by acquisition-prone firms, nor by a story of declining overconfidence with age. This paper underscores the relevance of CEO personal characteristics and CEO-level variation in agency problems for corporate decisions.",['Soojin Yim'],"['Corporate governance', 'Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'Agency problems', 'CEO compensation']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002383,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,1,Soojin Yim,2013,169.3821329953634
Investment shocks and the commodity basis spread,"I identify a “slope” factor in the cross section of commodity futures returns: high-basis commodity futures have higher loadings on this factor than low-basis commodity futures. Combined with a level factor (an index of commodity futures), this slope factor explains most of the average excess returns of commodity futures portfolios sorted by basis. More importantly, I find that this factor is significantly correlated with investment shocks, which represent the technological progress in producing new capital. I investigate a competitive dynamic equilibrium model of commodity production to endogenize this correlation. The model reproduces the cross-sectional futures returns and many asset pricing tests.",['Fan Yang'],"['Commodity futures', 'Investment-based asset pricing', 'Investment shocks', 'Basis spread']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001360,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,1,Fan Yang,2013,169.3821329953634
A new approach to predicting analyst forecast errors: Do investors overweight analyst forecasts?,"I provide evidence that investors overweight analyst forecasts by demonstrating that prices do not fully reflect predictable components of analyst errors, which conflicts with conclusions in prior research.

I estimate characteristic forecasts that map current firm characteristics into forecasts of future earnings. Contrasting characteristic and analyst forecasts predicts analyst forecast errors and revisions.

Nonlinear incentives and mortgage officers’ decisions,"In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, banks should ensure that their incentive compensation policies appropriately balance long-term risk with short-term rewards. Using daily output data from mortgage officers in a US commercial bank, we test the notion that nonlinear contracts create time-varying incentives for the employees and impose costs on the firm. We provide empirical evidence that mortgage officers greatly increase their output toward the end of each month, when the minimum monthly quota is assessed. This occurs through a combination of reducing the processing time and approving some marginal applications. We also find that mortgages originated on the last working day of the month have a higher likelihood of delinquency.","['Konstantinos Tzioumis', 'Matthew Gee']","['Nonlinear incentives', 'Quotas']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001791,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,2,Konstantinos Tzioumis,2013,169.3821329953634
Learning from repetitive acquisitions: Evidence from the time between deals,"Knowledge gleaned from previous acquisitions may confer valuation expertise and other benefits. But numerous acquisitions also entail costs, due to problems of incorporating diverse units into an ever larger firm. Such benefits and costs are not directly observable from outside the firm. This article proposes a simple model to infer their relative importance, using the time between successive deals. The data requirements are minimal and allow the use of all mergers and acquisitions during 1992–2009 (more than 300,000 deals). The results provide evidence of learning gains through repetitive acquisitions, especially under CEO continuity and when successive deals are more similar.","['Nihat Aktas', 'Eric de Bodt', 'Richard Roll']","['Acquisitions program', 'Learning', 'Integration costs', 'Time between successive deals']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002231,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,1,Nihat Aktas,2013,169.3821329953634
The economics of club bidding and value creation,"Many acquisitions are conducted by clubs, i.e., coalitions of acquirers that submit a single bid. We present a novel analysis of club bidding where the club creates value by aggregating, at least partially, bidders' values. We show that club formation can lead to higher acquisition prices when the number of bidders is exogenously fixed and large. However, when entry costs require bidders to optimize their participation decisions, club formation acts as an endogenous limit on competition and reduces the target's premium. In contrast, social efficiency with club bidding is always higher. Our findings can reconcile the contradictory evidence on club bidding.","['Robert Marquez', 'Rajdeep Singh']","['Club bidding', 'Joint bidding', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Takeover auctions', 'Private equity']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002462,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,2,Robert Marquez,2013,169.3821329953634
Quiet bubbles,"Motivated by the recent subprime mortgage crisis, we explore whether speculative bubble models of equity based on investor disagreement and short-sales constraints can also provide an explanation for the overvaluation of debt contracts. We find that this is unlikely. Equity bubbles are loud: price and volume go together as investors speculate on capital gains from reselling to more optimistic investors. But this resale option is limited for debt since its upside payoff is bounded. Debt bubbles then require an optimism bias among investors. But greater optimism leads to less speculative trading as investors view the debt as safe and having limited upside. Debt bubbles are hence quiet—high price comes with low volume. We find the predicted price–volume relationship of credits over the 2003–2007 credit boom.","['Harrison Hong', 'David Sraer']","['Bubbles', 'Credit', 'Asset prices', 'Turnover']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001979,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,3,Harrison Hong,2013,169.3821329953634
A nonlinear wealth transfer from shareholders to creditors around Chapter 11 filing,"Past literature has assumed that negative stock returns around Chapter 11 filing are solely due to new adverse information about firm value. This paper argues that there is also a nonlinear wealth transfer from shareholders to creditors causing shareholder loss. The magnitude of the wealth transfer can be quantified in a setting where equity is a call option on firm assets as in the Merton (1974) model. The wealth transfer originates from maturity shortening of the call option as a result of Chapter 11 filing. I present a parsimonious model to explain why Chapter 11 can be voluntarily filed by managers acting in the interest of shareholders with the existence of the wealth transfer. The model-predicted stock return has comparable magnitude as observed stock returns around filing, and explains the cross-sectional variation of the latter.",['Yuanzhi Li'],"['Chapter 11 filing', 'Wealth transfer']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001626,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,1,Yuanzhi Li,2013,169.3821329953634
The relation between equity incentives and misreporting: The role of risk-taking incentives,"Prior research argues that a manager whose wealth is more sensitive to changes in the firm׳s stock price has a greater incentive to misreport. However, if the manager is risk-averse and misreporting increases both equity values and equity risk, the sensitivity of the manager׳s wealth to changes in stock price (portfolio delta) will have two countervailing incentive effects: a positive “reward effect” and a negative “risk effect.” In contrast, the sensitivity of the manager׳s wealth to changes in risk (portfolio vega) will have an unambiguously positive incentive effect. We show that jointly considering the incentive effects of both portfolio delta and portfolio vega substantially alters inferences reported in prior literature. Using both regression and matching designs, and measuring misreporting using discretionary accruals, restatements, and enforcement actions, we find strong evidence of a positive relation between vega and misreporting and that the incentives provided by vega subsume those of delta. Collectively, our results suggest that equity portfolios provide managers with incentives to misreport when they make managers less averse to equity risk.","['Christopher S. Armstrong', 'David F.

The other side of value: The gross profitability premium,"Profitability, measured by gross profits-to-assets, has roughly the same power as book-to-market predicting the cross section of average returns. Profitable firms generate significantly higher returns than unprofitable firms, despite having significantly higher valuation ratios. Controlling for profitability also dramatically increases the performance of value strategies, especially among the largest, most liquid stocks. These results are difficult to reconcile with popular explanations of the value premium, as profitable firms are less prone to distress, have longer cash flow durations, and have lower levels of operating leverage.

Externalities of public firm presence: Evidence from private firms' investment decisions,"Public firms provide a large amount of information through their disclosures. In addition, information intermediaries publicly analyze, discuss, and disseminate these disclosures. Thus, greater public firm presence in an industry should reduce uncertainty in that industry. Following the theoretical prediction of investment under uncertainty, we hypothesize and find that private firms are more responsive to their investment opportunities when they operate in industries with greater public firm presence. Further, we find that the effect of public firm presence is greater in industries with better information quality and in industries characterized by a greater degree of investment irreversibility. Our results suggest that public firms generate positive externalities by reducing industry uncertainty and facilitating more efficient private firm investment.","['Brad Badertscher', 'Nemit Shroff', 'Hal D.

The economics of options-implied inflation probability density functions,"Recently a market in options based on consumer price index inflation (inflation caps and floors) has emerged in the US. This paper uses quotes on these derivatives to construct probability densities for inflation. We study how these probability density functions respond to news announcements and find that the implied odds of deflation are sensitive to certain macroeconomic news releases. We also estimate empirical pricing kernels using these option prices along with time series models fitted to inflation. The options-implied densities assign considerably more mass to extreme inflation outcomes (either deflation or high inflation) than do their time series counterparts. This yields a U-shaped empirical pricing kernel, with investors having high marginal utility in states of the world characterized by either deflation or high inflation.","['Yuriy Kitsul', 'Jonathan H.

Name fluency also affects other investment decisions, with fluently named closed-end funds trading at smaller discounts and fluent mutual funds attracting greater fund flows.","['T.

Mutual fund risk and market share-adjusted fund flows,"Several papers use a fractional specification (net inflow/ assets under management) to infer a convex relation between flow and past performance. However, heterogeneous linear response functions combined with the pooled analysis commonly used in these studies can yield false convexity estimates. We show that such heterogeneity obtains in practice. Along these same lines, the paper also finds that several previously unexamined implications of a convex flow-performance relation fail to hold. Moreover, convexity with fractional flows (which we confirm) largely disappears in a conditional analysis that controls for heterogeneity. Market shares offer an alternative specification for flow that is more resilient to heterogeneity. Using this alternative specification, we again find no evidence of convexity in the flow-performance relation. We conclude that the widely held belief that the flow response function is convex is due solely to misspecification of the empirical model. The flow-return relation is linear.","['Matthew Spiegel', 'Hong Zhang']","['Mutual funds', 'Fund flows', 'Investment flows', 'Convexity', 'Market share']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002474,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,2,Matthew Spiegel,2013,169.3821329953634

Flow and stock effects of large-scale treasury purchases: Evidence on the importance of local supply,"The Federal Reserve’s 2009 program to purchase $300 billion of US Treasury securities represented an unprecedented intervention in the Treasury market and provides a natural experiment with the potential to shed light on the price elasticities of Treasuries and theories of supply effects in the term structure. Using security-level data on Treasury prices and quantities during the course of this program, we document a ‘local supply’ effect in the yield curve—yields within a particular maturity sector responded more to changes in the amounts outstanding in that sector than to similar changes in other sectors. We find that this phenomenon was responsible for a persistent downward shift in yields averaging about 30 basis points over the course of the program (the “stock effect”). In addition, except at very long maturities, purchase operations caused an average decline in yields in the sector purchased of 3.5 basis points on the days when those operations occurred (the “flow effect”). The sensitivity of our results to security characteristics generally supports a view of segmentation or imperfect substitution within the Treasury market during this time.","['Stefania D’Amico', 'Thomas B.

A natural estimate consists in using the empirical correlation between the daily returns and the changes of daily volatility estimated from high frequency data. The puzzle lies in the fact that such an intuitively natural estimate yields nearly zero correlation for most assets tested, despite the many economic reasons for expecting the estimated correlation to be negative. To better understand the sources of the puzzle, we analyze the different asymptotic biases that are involved in high frequency estimation of the leverage effect, including biases due to discretization errors, to smoothing errors in estimating spot volatilities, to estimation error, and to market microstructure noise. This decomposition enables us to propose novel bias correction methods for estimating the leverage effect.","['Yacine Aït-Sahalia', 'Jianqing Fan', 'Yingying Li']","['High frequency data', 'Leverage effect', 'Market microstructure noise', 'Latent volatility', 'Correlation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000615,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,1,Yacine Aït-Sahalia,2013,169.3821329953634
Allocation of decision rights and the investment strategy of mutual funds,"The literature suggests that while decentralized decision making can allow for greater specialization in an organization, it heightens the cost of coordinating decisions. The mutual fund industry—in particular, sole- and team-managed balanced funds—provides an ideal setting to test the specialization versus coordination trade-off, as information on decision structures and fund actions is easily obtained. We show that sole-managed balanced funds, with centralized decision rights, exhibit significant market timing that requires reallocation across asset classes. However, consistent with coordination difficulties between managers specializing in particular asset classes, no market timing is evident in team-managed balanced funds. Team-managed funds exhibit greater returns from specialization, in the form of better security selection performance than sole-managed funds. These results hold cross-sectionally and for funds that switch management structures. The overall returns across different management structures are similar, indicating a market equilibrium. Investor flows reward market-timing performance for sole- but not team-managed funds.","['Nishant Dass', 'Vikram Nanda', 'Qinghai Wang']","['Teams', 'Coordination costs', 'Decision rights', 'Performance', 'Mutual funds']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001773,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,1,Nishant Dass,2013,169.3821329953634
New evidence on the first financial bubble,"The Mississippi Bubble, South Sea Bubble and the Dutch Windhandel of 1720 together represent the world's first global financial bubble. We hand-collect cross-sectional price data and investor account data from 1720 to test theories about market bubbles. Our tests suggest that innovation was a key driver of bubble expectations. We present evidence against the currently prevailing debt-for-equity conversion hypothesis and relate stock returns to innovations in Atlantic trade and insurance. We find evidence consistent with the innovation-driven bubble dynamics documented by Pastor and Veronesi (2009) for new economy stocks.

General equilibrium with heterogeneous participants and discrete consumption times,The paper investigates the term structure of interest rates imposed by equilibrium in a production economy consisting of participants with heterogeneous preferences. Consumption is restricted to an arbitrary number of discrete times.

Firm characteristics and long-run stock returns after corporate events,"The well-documented abnormal long-run buy-and-hold returns to firms issuing equity in initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings, firms bidding in mergers, and firms initiating dividends can be attributed to imperfect control-firm matching. In addition to firm size and market-to-book ratio, event firms on average differ from control firms in terms of idiosyncratic volatility, liquidity, return momentum, and capital investment, each of which also explains returns. We propose a simple regression-based approach to control for differences in firm characteristics across event and control firms, and we show that long-run abnormal returns do not differ significantly from zero for event firms in the 1980 to 2005 period. The returns to event firms are, therefore, consistent with patterns known to exist for the broad stock market and do not require event-specific explanations.","['Hendrik Bessembinder', 'Feng Zhang']","['Firm characteristics', 'Long-run stock returns', 'BHARs', 'Wealth relative', 'Calendar time portfolio method']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000524,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,1,Hendrik Bessembinder,2013,169.3821329953634
How do staggered boards affect shareholder value? Evidence from a natural experiment,The well-established negative correlation between staggered boards (SBs) and firm value could be due to SBs leading to lower value or a reflection of low-value firms' greater propensity to maintain SBs. We analyze the causal question using a natural experiment involving two Delaware court rulings—separated by several weeks and going in opposite directions—that affected the antitakeover force of SBs. We contribute to the long-standing debate on staggered boards by presenting empirical evidence consistent with the market viewing SBs as leading to lower firm value for the affected firms.,"['Alma Cohen', 'Charles C.Y.

Predicting market returns using aggregate implied cost of capital,"Theoretically, the implied cost of capital (ICC) is a good proxy for time-varying expected returns. We find that aggregate ICC strongly predicts future excess market returns at horizons ranging from one month to four years. This predictive power persists even in the presence of popular valuation ratios and business cycle variables, both in-sample and out-of-sample, and is robust to alternative implementations. We also find that ICCs of size and book-to-market portfolios predict corresponding portfolio returns.","['Yan Li', 'David T.

Acquisitions driven by stock overvaluation: Are they good deals?,"Theory and recent evidence suggest that overvalued firms can create value for shareholders if they exploit their overvaluation by using their stock as currency to purchase less overvalued firms. We challenge this idea and show that, in practice, overvalued acquirers significantly overpay for their targets. These acquisitions do not, in turn, lead to synergy gains. Moreover, these acquisitions seem to be concentrated among acquirers with the largest governance problems. CEO compensation, not shareholder value creation, appears to be the main motive behind acquisitions by overvalued acquirers.","['Fangjian Fu', 'Leming Lin', 'Micah S.

The timing of pay,"There exists large and persistent variation in not only how, but when employees are paid, a fact unexplained by existing theory. This paper develops a simple model of optimal pay timing for firms. When workers have self-control problems, they under-save and experience volatile consumption between paychecks. Thus, pay whose delivery matches the timing of workers' consumption needs will reduce wage costs. The model also explains why pay timing should be regulated (as it is in practice): although the worker benefits from a timing profile that smoothes her consumption, her lack of self-control induces her to attempt to undo the arrangement, either by renegotiating with her employer or by taking out payday loans. Regulation of pay timing and consumer borrowing is required to counter these efforts, helping the worker help herself.","['Christopher A. Parsons', 'Edward D.

CEO turnover in a competitive assignment framework,"There is widespread concern about whether Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) are appropriately punished for poor performance. While CEOs are more likely to be forced out if their performance is poor relative to the industry average, overall industry performance also matters. This seems puzzling if termination is disciplinary, however, we show that both absolute and relative performance-driven turnover can be natural and efficient outcomes in a competitive assignment model in which CEOs and firms form matches based on multiple characteristics. The model also has new predictions about replacement managers' equilibrium pay and performance.

Evidence from the U.S. agricultural industry,"This article constructs triple-difference tests around shifts in the supply of risk management instruments available to agricultural producers to reveal a positive relation between risk management and productivity. This relation is more robust when producers adopt instruments with payoffs linked to group performance and weaker when payoffs are linked to individual performance. Additionally, productivity is particularly high among risk-managing producers in counties containing high levels of bank deposits, a proxy for access to finance.

Corporate ownership structure and the choice between bank debt and public debt,"This article examines the relation between a borrowing firm's ownership structure and its choice of debt source using a novel data set on corporate ownership, control, and debt structures for 9,831 firms in 20 countries from 2001 to 2010. We find that the divergence between the control rights and cash-flow rights of a borrowing firm's largest ultimate owner has a significant negative impact on the firm's reliance on bank debt financing. In addition, we show that the control-ownership divergence affects other aspects of debt structure including debt maturity and security. Our results indicate that firms controlled by large shareholders with excess control rights may choose public debt financing over bank debt as a way of avoiding scrutiny and insulating themselves from bank monitoring.","['Chen Lin', 'Yue Ma', 'Paul Malatesta', 'Yuhai Xuan']","['Ownership structure', 'Excess control rights', 'Bank Debt', 'Public Debt']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1300086X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,2,Chen Lin,2013,169.3821329953634

The model matches the average yield curve up to five-year maturity almost perfectly. Longer term yields are roughly as volatile as in the data. The model also generates time-varying bond risk premiums. In particular, when running Fama-Bliss regressions of excess returns on forward premiums, the model produces slope coefficients of roughly half the size of the empirical counterparts.

The cost of borrowing corporate bonds is comparable to the cost of borrowing stock, between 10 and 20 basis points, and both have fallen over time. Factors that influence borrowing costs are loan size, percentage of inventory lent, rating, and borrower identity. There is no evidence that bond short sellers have private information. Bonds with Credit Default Swaps (CDS) contracts are more actively lent than those without. Finally, the 2007 Credit Crunch does not affect average borrowing costs or loan volume, but does increase borrowing cost variance.","['Paul Asquith', 'Andrea S. Au', 'Thomas Covert', 'Parag A.

"Delegated asset management, investment mandates, and capital immobility","This paper develops a model to explain the widely used investment mandates in the institutional asset management industry based on two insights: first, giving a manager more investment flexibility weakens the link between fund performance and his effort in the designated market, and thus increases agency cost. Second, the presence of outside assets with negatively skewed returns can further increase the agency cost if the manager is incentivized to pursue outside opportunities. These effects motivate narrow mandates and tight tracking error constraints to most fund managers except those with exceptional talents. Our model sheds light on capital immobility and market segmentation that are widely observed in financial markets, and highlights important effects of negatively skewed risk on institutional incentive structures.","['Zhiguo He', 'Wei Xiong']","['Institutional frictions', 'Negatively skewed risk', 'Tracking error constraints', 'Market segmentation']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1200164X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,2,Zhiguo He,2013,169.3821329953634
"Growth options, macroeconomic conditions, and the cross section of credit risk","This paper develops a structural equilibrium model with intertemporal macroeconomic risk, incorporating the fact that firms are heterogeneous in their asset composition. Compared with firms that are mainly composed of invested assets, firms with growth options have higher costs of debt because they are more volatile and have a greater tendency to default during recession when marginal utility is high and recovery rates are low. Our model matches empirical facts regarding credit spreads, default probabilities, leverage ratios, equity premiums, and investment clustering. Importantly, it also makes predictions about the cross section of all these features.","['Marc Arnold', 'Alexander F.

Rating agencies in the face of regulation,"This paper develops a theoretical framework to shed light on variation in credit rating standards over time and across asset classes. Ratings issued by credit rating agencies serve a dual role: they provide information to investors and are used to regulate institutional investors. We show that introducing rating-contingent regulation that favors highly rated securities may increase or decrease rating informativeness, but unambiguously increases the volume of highly rated securities. If the regulatory advantage of highly rated securities is sufficiently large, delegated information acquisition is unsustainable, since the rating agency prefers to facilitate regulatory arbitrage by inflating ratings. Our model relates rating informativeness to the quality distribution of issuers, the complexity of assets, and issuers' outside options. We reconcile our results with the existing empirical literature and highlight new, testable implications, such as repercussions of the Dodd-Frank Act.","['Christian C. Opp', 'Marcus M.

Second, capital enhances the performance of medium and large banks primarily during banking crises. Additional tests explore channels through which capital generates these effects.

"Political activism, information costs, and stock market participation","This paper examines whether political activism increases people's propensity to participate in the stock market. Our key conjecture is that politically active people follow political news more actively, which increases their chance of being exposed to financial news. Consequently, their information gathering costs are likely to be lower and the propensity to participate in the market would be higher. We find support for this hypothesis using multiple micro-level data sets, state-level data from the US, and cross-country data from Europe. Irrespective of their political affiliation, politically active individuals are 9–25% more likely to participate in the stock market. Using residence in “battleground” states and several other geographic instruments, we demonstrate that greater political activism reduces information gathering costs and causes higher market participation rates. Further, consistent with our conjecture, we find that politically active individuals spend about 30 minutes more on news daily and appear more knowledgeable about the economy and the markets.","['Yosef Bonaparte', 'Alok Kumar']","['Stock market participation', 'Political activism', 'Information costs', 'Individual investors', 'Geographic instruments']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001973,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,3,Yosef Bonaparte,2013,169.3821329953634
Anomalies and financial distress,"This paper explores commonalities across asset pricing anomalies. In particular, we assess implications of financial distress for the profitability of anomaly-based trading strategies. Strategies based on price momentum, earnings momentum, credit risk, dispersion, idiosyncratic volatility, and capital investments derive their profitability from taking short positions in high credit risk firms that experience deteriorating credit conditions. In contrast, the value-based strategy derives most of its profitability from taking long positions in high credit risk firms that survive financial distress and subsequently realize high returns. The accruals anomaly is an exception. It is robust among high and low credit risk firms in all credit conditions.","['Doron Avramov', 'Tarun Chordia', 'Gergana Jostova', 'Alexander Philipov']","['Asset pricing anomalies', 'Financial distress', 'Credit ratings']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002176,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,1,Doron Avramov,2013,169.3821329953634
Why Gaussian macro-finance term structure models are (nearly) unconstrained factor-VARs,"This paper explores the implications of filtering and no-arbitrage for the maximum likelihood estimates of the entire conditional distribution of the risk factors and bond yields in Gaussian macro-finance term structure model (MTSM) when all yields are priced imperfectly. For typical yield curves and macro-variables studied in this literature, the estimated joint distribution within a canonical MTSM is nearly identical to the estimate from an economic-model-free factor vector-autoregression (factor-VAR), even when measurement errors are large. It follows that a canonical MTSM offers no new insights into economic questions regarding the historical distribution of the macro risk factors and yields, over and above what is learned from a factor-VAR. These results are rotation-invariant and, therefore, apply to many of the specifications in the literature.","['Scott Joslin', 'Anh Le', 'Kenneth J.

Specifically, our baseline long-only strategies that exploit time-varying predictability provide four-factor alphas of 12–13% per year over the 1993–2008 period.

"Productivity, restructuring, and the gains from takeovers","This paper investigates how takeovers create value. Using plant-level data, I show that acquirers increase targets' productivity through more efficient use of capital and labor. Acquirers reduce capital expenditures, wages, and employment in target plants, though output is unchanged. Acquirers improve targets' investment efficiency through reallocating capital to industries with better investment opportunities. Moreover, changes in productivity help explain the merging firms' announcement returns. The combined announcement returns are driven by improvements in target's productivity.

We show that the largest divergences between the performance of reporting and nonreporting mega firms can be traced to differential exposure to credit markets. Thus, the performance of hard-to-observe mega firms can be inferred from observable data.

The impact of securitization on the expansion of subprime credit,"This paper investigates the relationship between securitization activity and the extension of subprime credit. The analysis is motivated by two sets of compelling empirical facts. First, the origination of subprime mortgages exploded between the years 2003 and 2005. Second, the securitization of subprime loans increased substantially over the same time period, driven primarily by the five largest independent broker/dealer investment banks. We argue that the relative shift in the securitization activity of investment banks was driven by forces exogenous to factors impacting lending decisions in the primary mortgage market and resulted in lower ZIP code denial rates, higher subprime origination rates, and higher subsequent default rates. Consistent with recent findings in the literature, we provide evidence that the increased securitization activity of investment banks reduced lenders' incentives to carefully screen borrowers.","['Taylor D.

The results from our time-series approach reinforce the importance of the skewness premium found in cross-sectional studies using lower-frequency data; and offer a potential resolution to sometimes conflicting results on the intertemporal risk-return relationship.

Creditors' inference about one another's type then influences their decision to lend to the next firm. By providing an analysis of the “incidence of failure” (the threshold for a liquidity crisis) for each firm, this paper demonstrates that the risk of contagion increases sharply if it originates ex ante from a firm facing a low probability of failure. In addition, the paper proposes some policy measures for mitigating the severity of contagion during a liquidity crisis.",['Frederick Dongchuhl Oh'],"['Contagion', 'Liquidity crisis', 'Global game', 'Learning', 'Coordination failure', 'Information structure']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001833,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,2,Frederick Dongchuhl Oh,2013,169.3821329953634
Cross section of option returns and idiosyncratic stock volatility,This paper presents a robust new finding that delta-hedged equity option return decreases monotonically with an increase in the idiosyncratic volatility of the underlying stock. This result cannot be explained by standard risk factors. It is distinct from existing anomalies in the stock market or volatility-related option mispricing. It is consistent with market imperfections and constrained financial intermediaries. Dealers charge a higher premium for options on high idiosyncratic volatility stocks due to their higher arbitrage costs. Controlling for limits to arbitrage proxies reduces the strength of the negative relation between delta-hedged option return and idiosyncratic volatility by about 40%.,"['Jie Cao', 'Bing Han']","['Option return', 'Idiosyncratic volatility', 'Market imperfections', 'Limits to arbitrage']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002450,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,1,Jie Cao,2013,169.3821329953634
Labor unemployment risk and corporate financing decisions,"This paper presents evidence that firms choose conservative financial policies partly to mitigate workers' exposure to unemployment risk. We exploit changes in state unemployment insurance laws as a source of variation in the costs borne by workers during layoff spells. We find that higher unemployment benefits lead to increased corporate leverage, particularly for labor-intensive and financially constrained firms. We estimate the ex ante, indirect costs of financial distress due to unemployment risk to be about 60 basis points of firm value for a typical BBB-rated firm. The findings suggest that labor market frictions have a significant impact on corporate financing decisions.","['Ashwini K. Agrawal', 'David A.

The inefficiency of refinancing: Why prepayment penalties are good for risky borrowers,"This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the efficiency of prepayment penalties in a dynamic competitive lending model with risky borrowers and costly default. When considering improvements in the borrower's creditworthiness as one of the reasons for refinancing mortgages, we show that refinancing penalties can be welfare improving and that they can be particularly beneficial to riskier borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates, reduced defaults, and increased availability of credit. Thus, a high concentration of prepayment penalties among the riskiest borrowers can be an outcome of efficient equilibrium in a mortgage market. We also provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the key predictions of our model.","['Chris Mayer', 'Tomasz Piskorski', 'Alexei Tchistyi']","['Inefficiency of refinancing', 'Prepayment penalties', 'Risky borrowers', 'Mortgages']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002152,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,3,Chris Mayer,2013,169.3821329953634
The costs of shareholder activism: Evidence from a sequential decision model,"This paper provides benchmarks for monitoring costs and evaluates the net returns to shareholder activism. I model activism as a sequential decision process consisting of demand negotiations, board representation, and proxy contest and estimate the costs of each activism stage. A campaign ending in a proxy fight has average costs of $10.71 million. I find that the estimated monitoring costs reduce activist returns by more than two-thirds. The mean net activist return is close to zero but the top quartile of activists earns higher returns on their activist holdings than on their non-activist investments.

Real effects of stock underpricing,This paper provides evidence for a causal effect of equity prices on corporate investment and employment. We use fire sales by distressed equity funds during the 2007–2009 financial crisis to identify substantial exogenous underpricing. Firms whose stocks are most underpriced have considerably lower investment and employment than industry peers not subject to any fire sale discount. The causal effect of underpricing on investment is found to be largely concentrated on the most financially constrained firms.,"['Harald Hau', 'Sandy Lai']","['Market inefficiency', 'Fire sales', 'Mutual funds', 'Investment', 'Employment']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1200236X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,2,Harald Hau,2013,169.3821329953634
“When the cat's away the mice will play”: Does regulation at home affect bank risk-taking abroad?,"This paper provides the first empirical evidence that bank regulation is associated with cross-border spillover effects through the lending activities of large multinational banks. We analyze business lending by 155 banks to 9,613 firms in 1,976 different localities across 16 countries. We find that lower barriers to entry, tighter restrictions on bank activities, and to a lesser degree higher minimum capital requirements in domestic markets are associated with lower bank lending standards abroad. The effects are stronger when banks are less efficiently supervised at home, and are observed to exist independently from the impact of host-country regulation.","['Steven Ongena', 'Alexander Popov', 'Gregory F.

Predictability of currency carry trades and asset pricing implications,"This paper studies the time series predictability of currency carry trades, constructed by selecting currencies to be bought or sold against the US dollar, based on forward discounts. Changes in a commodity index, currency volatility and, to a lesser extent, a measure of liquidity predict in-sample the payoffs of dynamically re-balanced carry trades, as evidenced by individual and joint p-values in monthly predictive regressions at horizons up to six months. Predictability is further supported through out-of-sample metrics, and a predictability-based decision rule produces sizable improvements in the Sharpe ratios and skewness profile of carry trade payoffs. Our evidence also indicates that predictability can be traced to the long legs of the carry trades and their currency components. We test the theoretical restrictions that an asset pricing model, with average currency returns and the mimicking portfolio for the innovations in currency volatility as risk factors, imposes on the coefficients in predictive regressions.","['Gurdip Bakshi', 'George Panayotov']","['Currency carry trades', 'Predictability', 'Commodity returns', 'Currency volatility', 'Liquidity', 'Predictability-based decision rule', 'Currency-related risk factors']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001347,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,1,Gurdip Bakshi,2013,169.3821329953634
"Capacity constraints, investor information, and hedge fund returns","To identify capacity constraints in hedge funds and simultaneously gauge how well-informed hedge fund investors are, we need measures of investor demand that do not affect deployed hedge fund assets. Using new data on investor interest from a secondary market for hedge funds, this paper verifies the existence of capacity constraints in hedge funds. There is more mixed evidence on the information available to hedge fund investors. Buy and sell indications arrive following fund outperformance.

The earnings announcement premium around the globe,"U.S. stocks have been shown to earn higher returns during earnings announcement months than during non-announcement months. We document that this earnings announcement premium exists across the globe. Moreover, it is not isolated to a few countries. Of the 20 countries with enough data to conduct a within-country analysis, nine exhibit a significantly positive premium. A cross-country analysis finds that the premium is strongest in countries with the greatest increase in idiosyncratic volatility around the time of their firms' earnings announcements, suggesting that uncertainty over the earnings information to be disclosed is a primary driver of the global announcement premium.","['Brad M.

"Risk and return: Long-run relations, fractional cointegration, and return predictability","Univariate dependencies in market volatility, both objective and risk neutral, are best described by long-memory fractionally integrated processes. Meanwhile, the ex post difference, or the variance swap payoff reflecting the reward for bearing volatility risk, displays far less persistent dynamics. Using intraday data for the Standard & Poor's 500 and the volatility index (VIX), coupled with frequency domain methods, we separate the series into various components. We find that the coherence between volatility and the volatility-risk reward is the strongest at long-run frequencies. Our results are consistent with generalized long-run risk models and help explain why classical efforts of establishing a naïve return-volatility relation fail. We also estimate a fractionally cointegrated vector autoregression (CFVAR). The model-implied long-run equilibrium relation between the two variance variables results in nontrivial return predictability over interdaily and monthly horizons, supporting the idea that the cointegrating relation between the two variance measures proxies for the economic uncertainty rewarded by the market.","['Tim Bollerslev', 'Daniela Osterrieder', 'Natalia Sizova', 'George Tauchen']","['High-frequency data', 'Realized and options implied volatilities', 'Volatility risk premium', 'Long-memory and fractional cointegration', 'Return predictability']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000032,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,2,Tim Bollerslev,2013,169.3821329953634
The role of the media in corporate governance: Do the media influence managers' capital allocation decisions?,"Using 636 large acquisition attempts that are accompanied by a negative stock price reaction at their announcement (“value-reducing acquisition attempts”) from 1990 to 2010, we find that, in deciding whether to abandon a value-reducing acquisition attempt, managers' sensitivity to the firm's stock price reaction at the announcement is influenced by the level and the tone of media attention to the proposed transaction. We interpret the results to imply that managers have reputational capital at risk in making corporate capital allocation decisions and that the level and tone of media attention heighten the impact of a value-reducing acquisition on the managers' reputational capital. To the extent that value-reducing acquisition attempts are more likely to be abandoned, the media can play a role in aligning managers' and shareholders' interests.","['Baixiao Liu', 'John J.

Corporate social responsibility and stakeholder value maximization: Evidence from mergers,"Using a large sample of mergers in the US, we examine whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) creates value for acquiring firms' shareholders. We find that compared with low CSR acquirers, high CSR acquirers realize higher merger announcement returns, higher announcement returns on the value-weighted portfolio of the acquirer and the target, and larger increases in post-merger long-term operating performance. They also realize positive long-term stock returns, suggesting that the market does not fully value the benefits of CSR immediately. In addition, we find that mergers by high CSR acquirers take less time to complete and are less likely to fail than mergers by low CSR acquirers. These results suggest that acquirers' social performance is an important determinant of merger performance and the probability of its completion, and they support the stakeholder value maximization view of stakeholder theory.","['Xin Deng', 'Jun-koo Kang', 'Buen Sin Low']","['Corporate social responsibility (CSR)', 'Stakeholder theory', 'Nexus of contract', 'Merger', 'Announcement return']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001384,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,1,Xin Deng,2013,169.3821329953634

Business cycles, firm characteristics, and standard risk factors do not account for the pattern in returns across presidencies.

Trade credit taken by constrained firms increased during this period. These findings are consistent with firms providing liquidity insurance to their clients when bank credit is scarce and offer an important precautionary savings motive for accumulating cash reserves.","['Emilia Garcia-Appendini', 'Judit Montoriol-Garriga']","['Trade credit', 'Corporate liquidity', 'Crisis', 'Financial constraints', 'Liquidity']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000536,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,1,Emilia Garcia-Appendini,2013,169.3821329953634

Moreover, we find that high risk-taking by foreign owners depends on the strength of country-level governance institutions.

Monitoring and corporate disclosure: Evidence from a natural experiment,"Using an experimental design that exploits exogenous reductions in coverage resulting from brokerage house mergers, we find that a reduction in coverage causes a deterioration in financial reporting quality.

The effects we uncover using our experimental design are an order of magnitude larger than estimates from ordinary least squares regressions that do not account for the endogeneity of coverage.

"Connecting two markets: An equilibrium framework for shorts, longs, and stock loans","We analyze a reduced-form framework for understanding the equity loan market's impact on share prices. We show that hard-to-borrow stocks will have distinct return patterns, responding more to shocks in the supply of shares available, and to changes in the heterogeneity of investor beliefs, than other stocks. We conduct two empirical tests in which we find strong support for these equilibrium predictions. In our first test, we take advantage of a tax-driven exogenous shock to share loan supply and find that when supply is reduced around dividend record dates, prices of hard-to-borrow stocks increase 1.1% while prices of easy-to-borrow stocks are unaffected. In our second test, we find that hard-to-borrow stocks have 4.8% lower three-month returns than other stocks, with negative returns concentrated in stocks with high heterogeneity in investor beliefs. Thus, we extend the Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002) result that stocks with a greater dispersion of investor beliefs have lower returns.","['Jesse Blocher', 'Adam V. Reed', 'Edward D.

What do boards really do? Evidence from minutes of board meetings☆,"We analyze a unique database from a sample of real-world boardrooms — minutes of board meetings and board-committee meetings of eleven business companies for which the Israeli government holds a substantial equity interest. We use these data to evaluate the underlying assumptions and predictions of models of boards of directors. These models generally fall into two categories: “managerial models” that assume boards play a direct role in managing the firm, and “supervisory models” that assume that boards monitor top management but do not make business decisions themselves. Consistent with the supervisory models, our minutes-based data suggest that boards spend most of their time monitoring management: approximately two-thirds of the issues boards discussed were of a supervisory nature, they were presented with only a single option in 99% of the issues discussed, and they disagreed with the CEO only 2.5% of the time. Nevertheless, at times boards do play a managerial role: Boards requested to receive further information or an update for 8% of the issues discussed, and they took an initiative with respect to 8.1% of them. In 63% of the meetings, boards took at least one of these actions or did not vote in line with the CEO. Taken together our results suggest that boards can be characterized as active monitors.","['Miriam Schwartz-Ziv', 'Michael S.

Securitization without risk transfer,"We analyze asset-backed commercial paper conduits, which experienced a shadow-banking run and played a central role in the early phase of the financial crisis of 2007–2009. We document that commercial banks set up conduits to securitize assets worth $1.3 trillion while insuring the newly securitized assets using explicit guarantees. We show that regulatory arbitrage was an important motive behind setting up conduits. In particular, the guarantees were structured so as to reduce regulatory capital requirements, more so by banks with less capital, and while still providing recourse to bank balance sheets for outside investors. Consistent with such recourse, we find that conduits provided little risk transfer during the run, as losses from conduits remained with banks instead of outside investors and banks with more exposure to conduits had lower stock returns.","['Viral V.

Directors' and officers' liability insurance and loan spreads,"We analyze the effect of directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&O insurance) on the spreads charged on bank loans. We find that higher levels of D&O insurance coverage are associated with higher loan spreads and that this relation depends on loan characteristics in economically sensible ways and is attenuated by monitoring mechanisms. This association between loan spreads and D&O insurance coverage is robust to controlling for endogeneity (because both could be related to firm risk). Our evidence suggests that lenders view D&O insurance coverage as increasing credit risk (potentially via moral hazard or information asymmetry). Further analyses show that higher levels of D&O insurance coverage are associated with greater risk taking and higher probabilities of financial restatement due to aggressive financial reporting. While greater use of D&O insurance increases the cost of debt, we find some evidence that D&O insurance coverage appears to improve the value of large increases in capital expenditure for firms with better internal and external governance.","['Chen Lin', 'Micah S.

Diminishing sensitivity predicts a disposition effect, price momentum, a reduced return volatility, and a positive return-volume correlation. Loss aversion generally predicts the opposite. In calibrated economies, there is a nontrivial range of preference parameters for prospect theory to simultaneously explain the disposition effect, the momentum effect, and the equity premium puzzle.

Limits to arbitrage and hedging: Evidence from commodity markets,"We build an equilibrium model of commodity markets in which speculators are capital constrained, and commodity producers have hedging demands for commodity futures. Increases in producers' hedging demand or speculators' capital constraints increase hedging costs via price-pressure on futures. These in turn affect producers' equilibrium hedging and supply decision inducing a link between a financial friction in the futures market and the commodity spot prices. Consistent with the model, measures of producers' propensity to hedge forecasts futures returns and spot prices in oil and gas market data from 1979 to 2010. The component of the commodity futures risk premium associated with producer hedging demand rises when speculative activity reduces. We conclude that limits to financial arbitrage generate limits to hedging by producers, and affect equilibrium commodity supply and prices.","['Viral V. Acharya', 'Lars A.

Worldwide reach of short selling regulations,"We characterize legality and incidence of short selling in a worldwide, multimarket framework. Home country short selling restrictions curtail home market stock borrowing by 45% and reduce short selling of the country's American Depository Receipts (ADRs) by 68% due to regulatory reach. Also, the 2008 US ban on short selling of financial firms reduced borrowing in foreign locations. These findings are robust to controls for option availability, enforcement, returns, firm size, trading volume, dividends, ADR level, volatility, days-to-cover, and industry sector. Further, we show that investor conduct resulting from adherence to professional standards is a more powerful mechanism of regulatory reach than intergovernment cooperation.","['Archana Jain', 'Pankaj K.

Valuation of VIX derivatives,"We conduct an extensive empirical analysis of VIX derivative valuation models before, during, and after the 2008–2009 financial crisis.

Legislating stock prices,"We demonstrate that legislation has a simple, yet previously undetected, impact on stock prices. Exploiting the voting record of legislators whose constituents are the affected industries, we show that the votes of these “interested” legislators capture important information seemingly ignored by the market. A long-short portfolio based on these legislators' views earns abnormal returns of over 90 basis points per month following the passage of legislation.

Realizing smiles: Options pricing with realized volatility,"We develop a discrete-time stochastic volatility option pricing model exploiting the information contained in the Realized Volatility (RV), which is used as a proxy of the unobservable log-return volatility. We model the RV dynamics by a simple and effective long-memory process, whose parameters can be easily estimated using historical data. Assuming an exponentially affine stochastic discount factor, we obtain a fully analytic change of measure. An empirical analysis of Standard and Poor's 500 index options illustrates that our model outperforms competing time-varying and stochastic volatility option pricing models.","['Fulvio Corsi', 'Nicola Fusari', 'Davide La Vecchia']","['High-frequency', 'Realized volatility', 'Option pricing']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001808,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,2,Fulvio Corsi,2013,169.3821329953634
Collateral and capital structure,"We develop a dynamic model of investment, capital structure, leasing, and risk management based on firms' need to collateralize promises to pay with tangible assets. Both financing and risk management involve promises to pay subject to collateral constraints. Leasing is strongly collateralized costly financing and permits greater leverage. More constrained firms hedge less and lease more, both cross-sectionally and dynamically. Mature firms suffering adverse cash flow shocks may cut risk management and sell and lease back assets. Persistence of productivity reduces the benefits to hedging low cash flows and can lead firms not to hedge at all.","['Adriano A. Rampini', 'S.

Political uncertainty and risk premia,"We develop a general equilibrium model of government policy choice in which stock prices respond to political news. The model implies that political uncertainty commands a risk premium whose magnitude is larger in weaker economic conditions. Political uncertainty reduces the value of the implicit put protection that the government provides to the market. It also makes stocks more volatile and more correlated, especially when the economy is weak. We find empirical evidence consistent with these predictions.","['Ľuboš Pástor', 'Pietro Veronesi']","['Political uncertainty', 'Government policy', 'Risk premia']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002080,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,3,Ľuboš Pástor,2013,169.3821329953634
Banking deregulation and innovation,"We document empirical support for a key micro-level channel—innovation by young, private firms—through which financial sector deregulation affects economic growth. We find that intrastate banking deregulation, which increased the local market power of banks, decreased the level and risk of innovation by young, private firms. In contrast, interstate banking deregulation, which decreased the local market power of banks, increased the level and risk of innovation by young, private firms. These contrasting effects on innovation also translated into contrasting effects on economic growth. Our study suggests that the nature of financial sector deregulation crucially affects its potential benefits to the real economy.","['Sudheer Chava', 'Alexander Oettl', 'Ajay Subramanian', 'Krishnamurthy V.

Contracting under asymmetric information: Evidence from lockup agreements in seasoned equity offerings,"We document the frequent use of lockup agreements in seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) and examine the determinants of their use, duration, and early release. We find that the likelihood of an SEO lockup and its duration are positively related to issuer information asymmetry measures. Lockup duration is negatively related to underwriter spreads and underpricing, indicating that lockups lower expected flotation costs. Lockups are frequently released early following share prices rises. We conclude that lockups represent a contracting solution to asymmetric information and agency problems that plague equity issues by helping to insure SEO quality and deter opportunistic insider trading.","['Jonathan M.

Gender and corporate finance: Are male executives overconfident relative to female executives?,"We examine corporate financial and investment decisions made by female executives compared with male executives. Male executives undertake more acquisitions and issue debt more often than female executives. Further, acquisitions made by firms with male executives have announcement returns approximately 2% lower than those made by female executive firms, and debt issues also have lower announcement returns for firms with male executives. Female executives place wider bounds on earnings estimates and are more likely to exercise stock options early. This evidence suggests men exhibit relative overconfidence in significant corporate decision making compared with women.","['Jiekun Huang', 'Darren J.

CEO compensation contagion: Evidence from an exogenous shock,"We examine how Chief Executive Officer (CEO) compensation increased at a subset of firms in response to a governance shock that affected compensation levels at other firms in the economy. We first show that Delaware-incorporated firms with staggered boards and no outside blockholders increased CEO compensation following the mid-1990s Delaware legal cases that strengthened their ability to resist hostile takeovers. Consistent with the Gabaix and Landier (2008) contagion hypothesis, non-Delaware firms subsequently increased CEO compensation when the rulings affected a substantial number of firms in their industries. We further show how these legal developments contributed significantly to the rapid increase in CEO compensation in the late 1990s.","['Frederick L. Bereskin', 'David C.

Controlling shareholders and market timing in share issuance,"We examine market timing in the equity issuance of firms controlled by large shareholders using a hand-collected data set of controlling shareholders' ownership stakes in Chile between 1990 and 2009. When a firm issues shares, the controlling shareholder can either maintain or change his ownership stake depending on how many of the new shares he subscribes. Issuance predicts poor future returns and is preceded by high returns, but only when the controlling shareholder's stake is significantly reduced. Consistent with market timing, the results are stronger in the absence of institutional investors and in hot issuance markets.","['Borja Larrain', 'Francisco Urzúa I.']","['Controlling shareholders', 'Issuance', 'Market timing', 'Ownership']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000937,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,3,Borja Larrain,2013,169.3821329953634
Supply uncertainty of the bond investor base and the leverage of the firm,"We examine the effect of the bond capital supply uncertainty of institutional investors (e.g., mutual bond funds and insurance companies) on the leverage of the firm using a novel data set. Our main finding is that the supply uncertainty of the firm's bond investor base — measured as (i) the average portfolio turnover, or (ii) the average flow volatility of investors holding the firm's bonds, or (iii) the prevalence of mutual funds among the firm's bondholders as opposed to insurance companies — has a negative and significant effect on the leverage of the firm. The supply uncertainty of the firm's bond investor base also has a negative and significant effect on the firm's probability of issuing bonds, and a positive and significant effect on the firm's probability of issuing equity and borrowing from banks. We take a multi-pronged approach to address potential endogeneity issues, including use of geography-based instruments and firm fixed effects, subsample analyses, and a placebo test. Our results highlight the fragility of access to the bond market for companies that depend on mutual funds with high turnover/ flow volatility as primary bond investors.","['Massimo Massa', 'Ayako Yasuda', 'Lei Zhang']","['Institutional investors', 'Corporate bonds', 'Bond capital supply uncertainty', 'Capital structure', 'Investor base']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001359,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,1,Massimo Massa,2013,169.3821329953634
The dark side of analyst coverage: The case of innovation,"We examine the effects of financial analysts on the real economy in the case of innovation. Our baseline results show that firms covered by a larger number of analysts generate fewer patents and patents with lower impact. To establish causality, we use a difference-in-differences approach that relies on the variation generated by multiple exogenous shocks to analyst coverage, as well as an instrumental variable approach. Our identification strategies suggest a negative causal effect of analyst coverage on firm innovation. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that analysts exert too much pressure on managers to meet short-term goals, impeding firms' investment in long-term innovative projects. We further discuss possible underlying mechanisms through which analysts impede innovation and show that there is a residual effect of analysts on innovation even after controlling for these mechanisms. Our paper offers novel evidence on a previously under-explored adverse consequence of analyst coverage—its hindrance to firm innovation.","['Jie (Jack) He', 'Xuan Tian']","['Innovation', 'Analyst coverage', 'Patents', 'Citations', 'Managerial myopia']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001086,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,3,Jie (Jack) He,2013,169.3821329953634
Institutional trading and stock resiliency: Evidence from the 2007–2009 financial crisis,"We examine the impact of institutional trading on stock resiliency during the financial crisis of 2007–2009. We show that buy-side institutions have different exposure to liquidity factors based on their trading style. Liquidity supplying institutions absorb the long-term order imbalances in the market and are critical to recovery patterns after a liquidity shock. We show that these liquidity suppliers withdraw from risky securities during the crisis and their participation does not recover for an extended period of time. The illiquidity of specific stocks is significantly affected by institutional trading patterns; participation by liquidity supplying institutions can ameliorate illiquidity, while participation by liquidity demanding institutions can exacerbate illiquidity. Our results provide guidance on why some stocks take longer to recover in a crisis.","['Amber Anand', 'Paul Irvine', 'Andy Puckett', 'Kumar Venkataraman']","['Institutional investors', 'Financial crisis', 'Liquidity', 'Trading costs', 'Resiliency']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1300024X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,3,Amber Anand,2013,169.3821329953634
Labor unions and tax aggressiveness,"We examine the impact of unionization on firms' tax aggressiveness. We find a negative association between firms' tax aggressiveness and union power and a decrease in tax aggressiveness after labor union election wins. This relation is consistent with labor unions influencing managers' in one, or both, of two ways: (1) constraining managers' ability to invest in tax aggressiveness through increased monitoring; or (2) decreasing returns to tax aggressiveness that arise from unions' rent seeking behavior. We also find preliminary evidence that the market expects these reductions around union elections and discounts firms that likely add shareholder value via aggressive tax strategies.","['James A.

Inventory investment and the cost of capital,"We examine the relation between inventory investment and the cost of capital in the time series and the cross section. We find consistent evidence that risk premiums, rather than real interest rates, are strongly negatively related to future inventory growth at the aggregate, industry, and firm levels. The effect is stronger for firms in industries that produce durables rather than nondurables, exhibit greater cyclicality in sales, require longer lead times, and are subject to more technological innovation. We then construct a production-based asset pricing model with two types of capital, fixed capital and inventories, to explain these empirical findings. Convex adjustment costs and a countercyclical price of risk lead to negative time series and cross-sectional relations between expected returns and inventory growth.","['Christopher S.

Does the director labor market offer ex post settling-up for CEOs? The case of acquisitions,"We examine the rewards for experience and ability in the director labor market. We show that large acquisitions are associated with significantly higher numbers of subsequent board seats for the acquiring CEO, target CEO, and the directors. We also find that, in the case of acquisitions, experience is more important than ability. Both value-destroying and value-increasing acquisitions have significant and positive effects on a CEO's future prospects in the director labor market. In addition to increasing our understanding of the director labor market, these results suggest that the ex post settling-up incentives thought to exist in the director labor market are weak for acquisitions.","['Jarrad Harford', 'Robert J.

"The role of shorting, firm size, and time on market anomalies","We examine the role of shorting, firm size, and time on the profitability of size, value, and momentum strategies. We find that long positions make up almost all of size, 60% of value, and half of momentum profits. Shorting becomes less important for momentum and more important for value as firm size decreases. The value premium decreases with firm size and is weak among the largest stocks. Momentum profits, however, exhibit no reliable relation with size. These effects are robust over 86 years of US equity data and almost 40 years of data across four international equity markets and five asset classes. Variation over time and across markets of these effects is consistent with random chance. We find little evidence that size, value, and momentum returns are significantly affected by changes in trading costs or institutional and hedge fund ownership over time.","['Ronen Israel', 'Tobias J.

Exploring the role Delaware plays as a domestic tax haven,"We examine whether Delaware is a domestic tax haven. We find that taxes play an economically important role in determining whether U.S. firms locate subsidiaries in Delaware and that a Delaware-based state tax avoidance strategy lowers state effective tax rates by between 0.7 and 1.1 percentage points, on average. The tax savings represent a 15–24% decrease in the state income tax burden and translate to an increase in net income of 1.04–1.47%. However, we find that the tax benefits of Delaware tax strategies are diminishing over time in response to initiatives by state governments to limit multistate tax avoidance.","['Scott D.

Can hedge funds time market liquidity?,"We explore a new dimension of fund managers' timing ability by examining whether they can time market liquidity through adjusting their portfolios' market exposure as aggregate liquidity conditions change. Using a large sample of hedge funds, we find strong evidence of liquidity timing. A bootstrap analysis suggests that top-ranked liquidity timers cannot be attributed to pure luck. In out-of-sample tests, top liquidity timers outperform bottom timers by 4.0–5.5% annually on a risk-adjusted basis. We also find that it is important to distinguish liquidity timing from liquidity reaction, which primarily relies on public information. Our results are robust to alternative explanations, hedge fund data biases, and the use of alternative timing models, risk factors, and liquidity measures. The findings highlight the importance of understanding and incorporating market liquidity conditions in investment decision making.","['Charles Cao', 'Yong Chen', 'Bing Liang', 'Andrew W.

The dividend month premium,"We find an asset pricing anomaly whereby companies have positive abnormal returns in months when they are predicted to issue a dividend. Abnormal returns in predicted dividend months are high relative to other companies and relative to dividend-paying companies in months without a predicted dividend, making risk-based explanations unlikely. The anomaly is as large as the value premium, but less volatile. The premium is consistent with price pressure from dividend-seeking investors. Measures of liquidity and demand for dividends are associated with larger price increases in the period before the ex-day (when there is no news about the dividend) and larger reversals afterward.","['Samuel M.

Using data from 1990 to 2008, we compare the alphas of mutual funds, hedge funds, and institutional funds operated by investment banks and non-bank conglomerates. We find that, while no difference exists in performance by fund type, being owned by an investment bank reduces alphas by 46 basis points per year in our baseline model. Making lead loans increases alphas, but the dispersion of fees across portfolios decreases alphas. The economic loss is $4.9 billion per year.","['Janis Berzins', 'Crocker H.

Adoptive expectations: Rising sons in Japanese family firms,"We find inherited family firms more important in postwar Japan than generally realized, and also performing well on average. Non-consanguineous heir-run firms outperform blood heirs' firms, and roughly match founder-run listed firms, while blood heirs surpass professional managers at running family firms. Further, succession events suggest that adopted heirs “cause” elevated performance. We suggest that heir-run firms do well because non-consanguineous heirs displace the least talented blood heirs, the non-consanguineous heir “job” motivates professional managers, and the threat of displacement encourages blood heirs' effort and human capital accumulation, mitigating the “Carnegie conjecture” that inherited wealth deadens talent.","['Vikas Mehrotra', 'Randall Morck', 'Jungwook Shim', 'Yupana Wiwattanakantang']","['Adoptions', 'Corporate governance', 'Family business', 'Inherited ability', 'Japan', 'Succession']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000287,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,3,Vikas Mehrotra,2013,169.3821329953634
Innovative efficiency and stock returns,"We find that innovative efficiency (IE), patents or citations scaled by research and development expenditures, is a strong positive predictor of future returns after controlling for firm characteristics and risk. The IE-return relation is associated with the loading on a mispricing factor, and the high Sharpe ratio of the Efficient Minus Inefficient (EMI) portfolio suggests that mispricing plays an important role. Further tests based upon attention and uncertainty proxies suggest that limited attention contributes to the effect. The high weight of the EMI portfolio return in the tangency portfolio suggests that IE captures incremental pricing effects relative to well-known factors.","['David Hirshleifer', 'Po-Hsuan Hsu', 'Dongmei Li']","['Innovative efficiency', 'Limited attention', 'Research and development', 'Market efficiency']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001961,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,3,David Hirshleifer,2013,169.3821329953634
Are mutual funds sitting ducks?,"We find that patient traders profit from the predictable, flow-induced trades of mutual funds. In anticipation of a 1%-of-volume change in mutual fund flows into a stock next quarter, the institutions in the same 13F category as hedge funds trade 0.29–0.45% of volume in the current quarter. A third of the trading is associated with the subset of 504 identified hedge funds. The effect is stronger when quarterly mutual fund portfolio disclosure is required and among hedge funds with more patient capital. A one standard deviation higher measure of anticipatory trading by a hedge fund is associated with a 0.9% higher annualized four-factor alpha. A one standard deviation higher measure of anticipation of a mutual fund's trades by institutions is associated with a 0.07–0.15% lower annualized four-factor alpha.

Investment cycles and startup innovation,"We find that venture capital-backed startups receiving their initial investment in hot markets are more likely to go bankrupt, but conditional on going public, are valued higher on the day of their initial public offering, have more patents, and have more citations to their patents. Our results suggest that VCs invest in riskier and more innovative startups in hot markets (rather than just worse firms). This is particularly true for the most experienced VCs. Furthermore, our results suggest that increased capital in hot times plays a causal role in shifting investments to more novel startups by lowering the cost of experimentation for early stage investors and allowing them to make riskier, more novel, investments.","['Ramana Nanda', 'Matthew Rhodes-Kropf']","['Venture capital', 'Innovation', 'Market cycles', 'Financing risk']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001967,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,2,Ramana Nanda,2013,169.3821329953634
The term structure of interbank risk,"We infer a term structure of interbank risk from spreads between rates on interest rate swaps indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and overnight indexed swaps. We develop a tractable model of interbank risk to decompose the term structure into default and non-default (liquidity) components. From August 2007 to January 2011, the fraction of total interbank risk due to default risk, on average, increases with maturity. At short maturities, the non-default component is important in the first half of the sample period and is correlated with measures of funding and market liquidity. The model also provides a framework for pricing, hedging, and risk management of interest rate swaps in the presence of significant basis risk.","['Damir Filipović', 'Anders B.

Changes to the ownership and control of East Asian corporations between 1996 and 2008: The primacy of politics,"We investigate changes to the ownership and control of East Asia's largest companies in 1996 and 2008. Newly compiled data for 1386 publicly traded companies at the end of 2008 are supplemented with existing data on 1,606 publicly traded companies at the end of 1996. Two main findings stand out. First, where status quo political arrangements persist, preexisting ownership arrangements go unchanged or become more entrenched.

Sharing information in the credit market: Contract-level evidence from U.S. firms,"We investigate the impact of lenders' information sharing on firms' performance in the credit market using rich contract-level data from a U.S. credit bureau. The staggered entry of lenders into the bureau offers a natural experiment to identify the effect of lenders' improved access to information. Consistent with the predictions of Padilla and Pagano, 1997, Padilla and Pagano, 2000 and Pagano and Jappelli (1993), we find that information sharing reduces contract delinquencies and defaults, especially when firms are informationally opaque.

Are there too many safe securities? Securitization and the incentives for information production,"We present a model that helps explain several past collapses of securitization markets. Originators issue too many informationally insensitive securities in good times, blunting investor incentives to become informed. The resulting endogenous scarcity of informed investors exacerbates primary market collapses in bad times. Inefficiency arises because informed investors are a public good from the perspective of originators. All originators benefit from the presence of additional informed investors in bad times, but each originator minimizes his reliance on costly informed capital in good times by issuing safe securities. Our model suggests regulations that limit the issuance of safe securities in good times.","['Samuel G.

Word power: A new approach for content analysis,"We present a new approach for content analysis to quantify document tone. We find a significant relation between our measure of the tone of 10-Ks and market reaction for both negative and positive words. We also find that the appropriate choice of term weighting in content analysis is at least as important as, and perhaps more important than, a complete and accurate compilation of the word list. Furthermore, we show that our approach circumvents the need to subjectively partition words into positive and negative word lists.

Credit supply and corporate innovation,"We present evidence that banking development plays a key role in technological progress. We focus on manufacturing firms' innovative performance, measured by patent-based metrics, and employ exogenous variations in banking development arising from the staggered deregulation of banking activities across US states during the 1980s and 1990s. We find that interstate banking deregulation had significant beneficial effects on the quantity and quality of innovation activities, especially for firms highly dependent on external capital and located closer to entering banks. Furthermore, we find that these results are strongly driven by a greater ability of deregulated banks to geographically diversify credit risk.","['Mario Daniele Amore', 'Cédric Schneider', 'Alminas Žaldokas']","['Financial development', 'Banking deregulation', 'Innovation', 'Risk diversification']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1300113X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,3,Mario Daniele Amore,2013,169.3821329953634
The mystery of zero-leverage firms,"We present the puzzling evidence that, from 1962 to 2009, an average 10.2% of large public nonfinancial US firms have zero debt and almost 22% have less than 5% book leverage ratio. Zero-leverage behavior is a persistent phenomenon. Dividend-paying zero-leverage firms pay substantially higher dividends, are more profitable, pay higher taxes, issue less equity, and have higher cash balances than control firms chosen by industry and size. Firms with higher Chief Executive Officer (CEO) ownership and longer CEO tenure are more likely to have zero debt, especially if boards are smaller and less independent. Family firms are also more likely to be zero-levered.","['Ilya A.

Growth to value: Option exercise and the cross section of equity returns,"We propose a general equilibrium model to study the link between the cross section of expected returns and book-to-market characteristics. We model two primitive assets: value assets and growth assets that are options on assets in place. The cost of option exercise, which is endogenously determined in equilibrium, is highly procyclical and acts as a hedge against risks in assets in place. Consequently, growth options are less risky than value assets, and the model features a value premium. Our model incorporates long-run risks in aggregate consumption and replicates the empirical failure of the conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM) prediction. The model also quantitatively accounts for the pattern in mean returns on book-to-market sorted portfolios, the magnitude of the CAPM-alphas, and other stylized features of the cross-sectional data.","['Hengjie Ai', 'Dana Kiku']","['Value premium', 'Real options', 'General equilibrium', 'Long-run risks', 'Firm dynamics']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001638,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,2,Hengjie Ai,2013,169.3821329953634
Does shareholder coordination matter? Evidence from private placements,We propose a new role for private investments in public equity (PIPEs) as a mechanism to reduce coordination frictions among existing equity holders. We establish a causal link between the coordination ability of incumbent shareholders and PIPE issuance. This result obtains even after controlling for alternative explanations such as information asymmetry and access to public markets. Improved equity coordination following a private placement leads to favorable debt renegotiations within one year of issuance. Mitigating coordination frictions among shareholders ultimately decreases the odds of firm default in half.,"['Indraneel Chakraborty', 'Nickolay Gantchev']","['Private placements', 'Equity issuance', 'Shareholder coordination', 'Debt renegotiation', 'Firm distress']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12002139,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,1,Indraneel Chakraborty,2013,169.3821329953634
The deep-pocket effect of internal capital markets,"We provide evidence that incumbent and entrant firms' access to business group deep pockets affects the entry patterns in product markets. Relying on a unique French data set on business groups, our paper shows that entry into manufacturing industries is negatively related to the cash hoarded by incumbent affiliated groups and positively related to entrant groups' cash. In line with theoretical predictions, we find that the impact of group cash holdingson entry is more important in environments where financial constraints are pronounced. The cash holdings of incumbent and entrant groups also affect the survival rate of entrants in the three- to five-year post-entry window. Overall, our findings suggest that internal capital markets operate within corporate groups and affect the product market behavior of affiliated firms by mitigating financial constraints.","['Xavier Boutin', 'Giacinta Cestone', 'Chiara Fumagalli', 'Giovanni Pica', 'Nicolas Serrano-Velarde']","['Business groups', 'Cash holdings', 'Internal capital markets', 'Entry']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000469,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,1,Xavier Boutin,2013,169.3821329953634
Determinants of corporate cash policy: Insights from private firms,"We provide one of the first large sample comparisons of cash policies in public and private U.S. firms. We first show that despite higher financing frictions, private firms hold, on average, about half as much cash as public firms do. By examining the drivers of cash policies for each group, we are able to attribute the difference to the much higher agency costs in public firms. By combining evidence from across public and private firms as well as within public firms across different qualities of governance, we are able to reconcile existing mixed evidence on the effects of agency problems on cash policies. Specifically, agency problems affect not only the target level of cash, but also how managers react to cash in excess of the target.","['Huasheng Gao', 'Jarrad Harford', 'Kai Li']","['Cash holdings', 'Financing frictions', 'Agency conflicts', 'Private firms', 'Excess cash', 'Speed of adjustment']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001153,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,3,Huasheng Gao,2013,169.3821329953634
Are small firms less vulnerable to overpriced stock offers?,"We show an inverted-U relation between targetiveness (probability of being targeted) and firm size. However, this pattern describes stock offers and is more pronounced during hot markets characterized by higher stock valuations. For cash offers we find a negative and monotonic relation. These contrasting patterns suggest that small firms (in the bottom NYSE size quartile) are less vulnerable to overpriced stock offers. In addition, we find that the stock acquirers of small targets are less overvalued than those of large targets, and that the announcement returns are less negative for stock acquirers of small targets than for those of large targets.","['Anand M.

Pricing the term structure with linear regressions,We show how to price the time series and cross section of the term structure of interest rates using a three-step linear regression approach. Our method allows computationally fast estimation of term structure models with a large number of pricing factors. We present specification tests favoring a model using five principal components of yields as factors. We demonstrate that this model outperforms the Cochrane and Piazzesi (2008) four-factor specification in out-of-sample exercises but generates similar in-sample term premium dynamics. Our regression approach can also incorporate unspanned factors and allows estimation of term structure models without observing a zero-coupon yield curve.,"['Tobias Adrian', 'Richard K.

"Riding the merger wave: Uncertainty, reduced monitoring, and bad acquisitions","We show that acquisitions initiated during periods of high merger activity (“merger waves”) are accompanied by poorer quality of analysts' forecasts, greater uncertainty, and weaker CEO turnover-performance sensitivity. These conditions imply reduced monitoring and lower penalties for initiating inefficient mergers. Therefore, merger waves may foster agency-driven behavior, which, along with managerial herding, could lead to worse mergers. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the average long-term performance of acquisitions initiated during merger waves is significantly worse. We also find that corporate governance of in-wave acquirers is weaker, suggesting that agency problems may be present in merger wave acquisitions.","['Ran Duchin', 'Breno Schmidt']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Governance', 'Merger waves', 'Turnover', 'Uncertainty']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001535,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,1,Ran Duchin,2013,169.3821329953634
Why are US firms using more short-term debt?,"We show that corporate use of long-term debt has decreased in the US over the past three decades and that this trend is heterogeneous across firms. The median percentage of debt maturing in more than 3 years decreased from 53% in 1976 to 6% in 2008 for the smallest firms but did not decrease for the largest firms. The decrease in debt maturity was generated by firms with higher information asymmetry and new firms issuing public equity in the 1980s and 1990s. Finally, we show that demand-side factors do not fully explain this trend and that public debt markets' supply-side factors play an important role. Our findings suggest that the shortening of debt maturity has increased the exposure of firms to credit and liquidity shocks.","['Cláudia Custódio', 'Miguel A. Ferreira', 'Luís Laureano']","['Corporate debt maturity', 'Information asymmetry', 'Agency costs', 'New listings', 'Supply effects']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1200222X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,1,Cláudia Custódio,2013,169.3821329953634
Generalists versus specialists: Lifetime work experience and chief executive officer pay,"We show that pay is higher for chief executive officers (CEOs) with general managerial skills gathered during lifetime work experience. We use CEOs' résumés of Standard and Poor's 1,500 firms from 1993 through 2007 to construct an index of general skills that are transferable across firms and industries. We estimate an annual pay premium for generalist CEOs (those with an index value above the median) of 19% relative to specialist CEOs, which represents nearly a million dollars per year. This relation is robust to the inclusion of firm- and CEO-level controls, including fixed effects. CEO pay increases the most when firms externally hire a new CEO and switch from a specialist to a generalist CEO. Furthermore, the pay premium is higher when CEOs are hired to perform complex tasks such as restructurings and acquisitions. Our findings provide direct evidence of the increased importance of general managerial skills over firm-specific human capital in the market for CEOs in the last decades.","['Cláudia Custódio', 'Miguel A.

Mutual fund skill and the performance of corporate acquirers,"We show that the commonly observed correlation between institutional investor ownership and the success of mergers is partly driven by active stock picking. Several mutual fund stock selection skill measures strongly predict the post-merger performance of corporate acquirers even after controlling for possible shareholder monitoring. These findings are stronger for funds with characteristics more indicative of active stock picking. Moreover, firms held by funds with higher stock selection skills are more likely to subsequently become acquirers, suggesting that the mutual fund skill set includes the ability to identify acquirers with value-enhancing acquisition opportunities.","['Amrita Nain', 'Tong Yao']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Corporate governance', 'Mutual funds', 'Stock selection']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001943,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,2,Amrita Nain,2013,169.3821329953634
Trading frenzies and their impact on real investment,"We study a model in which a capital provider learns from the price of a firm's security in deciding how much capital to provide for new investment. This feedback effect from the financial market to the investment decision gives rise to trading frenzies, in which speculators all wish to trade like others, generating large pressure on prices. Coordination among speculators is sometimes desirable for price informativeness and investment efficiency, but speculators' incentives push in the opposite direction, so that they coordinate exactly when it is undesirable. We analyze the effect of various market parameters on the likelihood of trading frenzies to arise.","['Itay Goldstein', 'Emre Ozdenoren', 'Kathy Yuan']","['Trading frenzies', 'Feedback effect', 'Financial-market runs', 'Bear raids']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000913,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,109,2,Itay Goldstein,2013,169.3821329953634
Equity yields,"We study a new data set of dividend futures with maturities up to ten years across three world regions: the US, Europe, and Japan. We use these asset prices to construct equity yields, analogous to bond yields. We decompose the equity yields to obtain a term structure of expected dividend growth rates and a term structure of risk premia, which decomposes the equity risk premium by maturity. We find that the slope of the term structure of risk premia is pro-cyclical, whereas the slope of the term structure of expected dividend growth rates is counter-cyclical. The comovement of yields across regions is, on average, higher for long-maturity yields than for short-maturity yields, whereas the variation in this comovement is much higher for short-maturity yields.","['Jules van Binsbergen', 'Wouter Hueskes', 'Ralph Koijen', 'Evert Vrugt']",[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002316,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,110,3,Jules van Binsbergen,2013,169.3821329953634
CEO contract design: How do strong principals do it?,"We study changes in chief executive officer (CEO) contracts when firms transition from public ownership with dispersed owners to private ownership with strong principals in the form of private equity sponsors. The most significant changes are that a significant portion of equity grants performance-vests based on prespecified measures and that unvested equity is forfeited by fired CEOs. Private equity sponsors do not reduce base salaries, bonuses, and perks, but redesign contracts away from qualitative measures. They use some subjective performance evaluation, do not use indexed or premium options, and do not condition vesting on relative industry performance. We compare the contracts to predictions from contracting theories, and relate our results to discussions of executive compensation reform.","['Henrik Cronqvist', 'Rüdiger Fahlenbrach']","['LBOs', 'Employment contracts', 'Contracting theory', 'Executive compensation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000305,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,3,Henrik Cronqvist,2013,169.3821329953634
Optimal incentives and securitization of defaultable assets,"We study optimal securitization in the presence of an initial moral hazard. A financial intermediary creates and then sells to outside investors defaultable assets, whose default risk is determined by the unobservable costly effort exerted by the intermediary. We calculate the optimal contract for any given effort level and show the natural emergence of extreme punishment for defaults, under which investors stop paying the intermediary after the first default. With securitization contracts optimally designed, we find securitization improves the intermediary's screening incentives. Furthermore, the equilibrium effort level and the surplus converge to their first best levels with sufficiently many assets.","['Semyon Malamud', 'Huaxia Rui', 'Andrew Whinston']","['Securitization', 'Mortgage-backed securities', 'Asset-backed securities', 'Moral hazard', 'Default risk']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001559,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,1,Semyon Malamud,2013,169.3821329953634
Do stock prices influence corporate decisions? Evidence from the technology bubble,"We study the capital investment, stock issuance, and cash savings behavior of non-tech manufacturers (old economy firms) during the 1990s technology bubble. Our empirical results show that high stock prices affect corporate policies because they relax financing constraints. During the tech bubble, constrained non-tech firms' investment responded strongly to “high stock prices” (specifically, the component of price that is not captured by fundamentals). They also issued stock in response to that overvaluation effect, saving part of the proceeds in their cash accounts. We find no such patterns for unconstrained non-tech firms, nor for tech firms. Our findings are not consistent with the notion that managers systematically issue overvalued stocks and invest in ways that transfer wealth from new to old shareholders. More broadly, they suggest that what appears to be overvaluation in one sector of the economy may have positive externalities for other sectors.","['Murillo Campello', 'John R.

Liquidity risk of corporate bond returns: conditional approach,"We study the exposure of the US corporate bond returns to liquidity shocks of stocks and Treasury bonds over the period 1973–2007 in a regime-switching model. In one regime, liquidity shocks have mostly insignificant effects on bond prices, whereas in another regime, a rise in illiquidity produces significant but conflicting effects: Prices of investment-grade bonds rise while prices of speculative-grade (junk) bonds fall substantially (relative to the market). Relating the probability of these regimes to macroeconomic conditions we find that the second regime can be predicted by economic conditions that are characterized as “stress.” These effects, which are robust to controlling for other systematic risks (term and default), suggest the existence of time-varying liquidity risk of corporate bond returns conditional on episodes of flight to liquidity. Our model can predict the out-of-sample bond returns for the stress years 2008–2009. We find a similar pattern for stocks classified by high or low book-to-market ratio, where again, liquidity shocks play a special role in periods characterized by adverse economic conditions.","['Viral V.

Alliances and corporate governance,"We study the link between a firm's quality of governance and its alliance activity. We consider alliances as a commitment technology that helps a company’ Chief Executive Officer overcome agency problems that relate to the inability to ex ante motivate division managers. We show that well-governed firms are more likely to avail themselves of this technology to anticipate ex post commitment problems and resolve them. The role of governance is particularly important when the commitment problems are more acute, such as for significantly risky/long-horizon projects (“longshots”) or firms more prone to inefficient internal redistribution of resources (conglomerates), as well as in the absence of alternative disciplining devices (e.g., low product market competition). Governance also mitigates agency issues between alliance partners; dominant alliance partners agree to a more equal split of power with junior partners that are better governed. An “experiment” that induces cross-sectional variation in the cost of the alliance commitment technology provides evidence of a causal link between governance and alliances.","['Andriy Bodnaruk', 'Massimo Massa', 'Andrei Simonov']","['Alliances', 'Corporate governance', 'Abnormal return', 'Profitability']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1200195X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,3,Andriy Bodnaruk,2013,169.3821329953634
Pyramidal ownership and the creation of new firms,"We study the role of pyramidal ownership structures in the creation of new firms. Our results suggest that pyramids arise because they provide a financing advantage in setting up new firms when the pledgeability of cash flows to outside financiers is limited. Parent companies supply inside funds to new firms that, due to large investment requirements and low pledgeable cash flows, cannot raise enough external financing. The financing advantage of pyramidal structures is pervasive in many countries, exists regardless of whether new firms are set up by business groups or by smaller organizations, and is an important underpinning of entrepreneurial activity.","['Jan Bena', 'Hernán Ortiz-Molina']","['Ownership pyramids', 'Parent companies', 'Startups', 'New firms', 'Access to capital']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000263,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,108,3,Jan Bena,2013,169.3821329953634
"Strategic alliances, venture capital, and exit decisions in early stage high-tech firms","We study the trade-offs that biotech start-ups face in the private equity market when they choose between raising firm-level capital from venture capitalists or project-level capital from strategic alliance partners. Increased alliance activity makes future alliances more likely, but future VC activity less likely. In contrast, venture capital (VC) activity makes both future alliance and future VC activity more likely. Both types of private capital raise the hazard of going public. Acquisition as an alternative to initial public offering is made more likely by increased VC activity, but the link between acquisition probabilities and alliance activity is less clear-cut. These results highlight both the importance of alliance partners in resolving asymmetric information problems in the capital acquisition process and the potential conflict of interest between different sources of private equity.","['Umit Ozmel', 'David T.

"Human capital, capital structure, and employee pay: An empirical analysis","We test the predictions of Titman (1984) and Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) by examining the effect of leverage on labor costs. Leverage has a significantly positive impact on cash, equity-based, and total compensation of chief executive officers (CEOs). Compensation of new CEOs hired from outside the firm is positively related to prior-year firm leverage. In addition, leverage has a positive and significant impact on average employee pay. The incremental total labor expenses associated with an increase in leverage are large enough to offset the incremental tax benefits of debt.

Our difference-in-differences estimate is consistent with a unitary elasticity of connected firms’ performance to political power (as measured by population per elected politician). Increasing power boosts firms’ operating returns, especially in industries relying heavily on public demand.

In integrated markets, discount rates and expected growth opportunities should be similar within one industry, irrespective of the country, implying narrowing valuation differentials as countries become more integrated. Our analysis of the 1990–2007 period shows that membership in the EU significantly lowered discount rate and expected earnings growth differentials across countries. In contrast, the adoption of the Euro was not associated with increased integration.

Is there price discovery in equity options?,"We use tick-by-tick quote data for 39 liquid US stocks and options on them, and we focus on events when the two markets disagree about the stock price in the sense that the option-implied stock price obtained from the put-call parity relation is inconsistent with the actual stock price. Option market quotes adjust to eliminate the disagreement, while the stock market quotes behave normally, as if there were no disagreement. The disagreement events are typically precipitated by stock price movements and display signed option volume in the direction that tends to eliminate the disagreements. These results show that option price quotes do not contain economically significant information about future stock prices beyond what is already reflected in current stock prices, i.e., no economically significant price discovery occurs in the option market. We also find no option market price discovery using a much larger sample of disagreement events based on a weaker definition of a disagreement, which verifies that the findings for the primary sample are not due to unusual or unrepresentative market behavior during the put-call parity violations.","['Dmitriy Muravyev', 'Neil D.

Payout taxes and the allocation of investment,"When corporate payout is taxed, internal equity (retained earnings) is cheaper than external equity (share issues). If there are no perfect substitutes for equity finance, payout taxes may therefore have an effect on the investment of firms. High taxes will favor investment by firms who can finance internally. Using an international panel with many changes in payout taxes, we show that this prediction holds well. Payout taxes have a large impact on the dynamics of corporate investment and growth. Investment is “locked in” in profitable firms when payout is heavily taxed. Thus, apart from any level effects, payout taxes change the allocation of capital.","['Bo Becker', 'Marcus Jacob', 'Martin Jacob']","['Corporate payout', 'Dividend taxes', 'Investment allocation']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001572,Journal of Financial Economics,0.6542436171899034,107,1,Bo Becker,2013,169.3821329953634

These include the disposition effect, the poor trading performance of individual investors, the higher volume of trade in rising markets, the effect of historical highs on the propensity to sell, the individual investor preference for volatile stocks, the low average return of volatile stocks, and the heavy trading associated with highly valued assets.","['Nicholas Barberis', 'Wei Xiong']","['Behavioral finance', 'Disposition effect', 'Trading', 'Individual investors']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11002376,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,104,2,Nicholas Barberis,2012,169.29798886570848
Difference in interim performance and risk taking with short-sale constraints,"Absent much theory, empirical works often rely on the following informal reasoning when looking for evidence of a mutual fund tournament: If there is a tournament, interim winners have incentives to decrease their portfolio volatility as they attempt to protect their lead, while interim losers are expected to increase their volatility so as to catch up with winners. We consider a rational model of a mutual fund tournament in the presence of short-sale constraints and find the opposite: Interim winners choose more volatile portfolios in equilibrium than interim losers. Several empirical works present evidence consistent with our model. However, based on the above informal argument, they appear to conclude against the tournament behavior. We argue that this conclusion is unwarranted. We also demonstrate that tournament incentives lead to differences in interim performance for otherwise identical managers and that mid-year trading volume is inversely related to mid-year stock return.","['Suleyman Basak', 'Dmitry Makarov']","['Mutual fund tournament', 'Risk-taking incentives', 'Relative performance', 'Portfolio choice', 'Short-sale constraints']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11002200,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,103,2,Suleyman Basak,2012,169.29798886570848
‘Déjà vol’: Predictive regressions for aggregate stock market volatility using macroeconomic variables,"Aggregate stock return volatility is both persistent and countercyclical. This paper tests whether it is possible to improve volatility forecasts at monthly and quarterly horizons by conditioning on additional macroeconomic variables. I find that several variables related to macroeconomic uncertainty, time-varying expected stock returns, and credit conditions Granger cause volatility. It is more difficult to find evidence that forecasts exploiting macroeconomic variables outperform a univariate benchmark out-of-sample. The most successful approaches involve simple combinations of individual forecasts. Predictive power associated with macroeconomic variables appears to concentrate around the onset of recessions.",['Bradley S.

The cost and timing of financial distress,"Assessments of the trade-off theory have typically compared the present value of tax benefits to the present value of bankruptcy costs. We verify that this comparison overwhelmingly favors tax benefits, suggesting that firms are under-leveraged. However, when we allow firms to experience even modest (e.g., 1–2% annualized) financial distress costs prior to bankruptcy, the cumulative present value of such costs can easily offset the tax benefits.","['Redouane Elkamhi', 'Jan Ericsson', 'Christopher A.

Multifactor models and their consistency with the ICAPM,"Can any multifactor model be interpreted as a variant of the Intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM)? The ICAPM places restrictions on time-series and cross-sectional behavior of state variables and factors. If a state variable forecasts positive (negative) changes in investment opportunities in time-series regressions, its innovation should earn a positive (negative) risk price in the cross-sectional test of the respective multifactor model. Second, the market (covariance) price of risk must be economically plausible as an estimate of the coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA). We apply our ICAPM criteria to eight popular multifactor models and the results show that most models do not satisfy the ICAPM restrictions. Specifically, the “hedging” risk prices have the wrong sign and the estimates of RRA are not economically plausible. Overall, the Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) models perform the best in consistently meeting the ICAPM restrictions. The remaining models, which represent some of the most relevant examples presented in the empirical asset pricing literature, can still empirically explain the size, value, and momentum anomalies, but they are generally inconsistent with the ICAPM.","['Paulo Maio', 'Pedro Santa-Clara']","['Asset pricing models', 'Intertemporal CAPM', 'Predictability of stock returns', 'Cross-section of stock returns', 'Value and momentum']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001511,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,3,Paulo Maio,2012,169.29798886570848
Seeking safety: The relation between CEO inside debt holdings and the riskiness of firm investment and financial policies,"CEO inside debt holdings (pension benefits and deferred compensation) are generally unsecured and unfunded liabilities of the firm. Because these characteristics of inside debt expose the CEO to default risk similar to that faced by outside creditors, theory predicts that CEOs with large inside debt holdings will display lower levels of risk-seeking behavior (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Consistent with the theoretical predictions, we find a negative association between CEO inside debt holdings and the volatility of future firm stock returns, R&D expenditures, and financial leverage, and a positive association between CEO inside debt holdings and the extent of diversification and asset liquidity. Collectively, our results provide empirical evidence suggesting that CEOs with large inside debt holdings prefer investment and financial policies that are less risky.","['Cory A. Cassell', 'Shawn X.

Optimal clearing arrangements for financial trades,"Clearinghouses support financial trades by keeping records of transactions and by providing liquidity through short-term credit that participants clear periodically. We study efficient clearing arrangements for exchanges, where traders must clear with a clearinghouse, and for over-the-counter (OTC) markets, where traders can clear bilaterally. When clearing is costly, it can be efficient to subsidize OTC clearing by charging a higher clearing price for transactions conducted on exchanges. The clearinghouse then operates across both markets. Since clearinghouses offer credit, intertemporal incentives are needed to ensure settlement. When liquidity costs increase, concerns about default lead to a tightening of liquidity provision.","['Thorsten Koeppl', 'Cyril Monnet', 'Ted Temzelides']","['Clearing', 'OTC vs. exchanges', 'Private information', 'Liquidity costs', 'Default']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001917,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,103,1,Thorsten Koeppl,2012,169.29798886570848

This paper shows that investment in short-term projects has beneficial effects in that it provides early feedback about Chief Executive Officer (CEO) talent, which leads to more efficient replacement decisions. Due to the threat of CEO turnover, the optimal design of stock option vesting conditions in executive compensation is more subtle than conventional views suggest. For example, I show that long vesting periods can backfire and induce excessive short-term investments.

Counterparty credit risk and the credit default swap market,"Counterparty credit risk has become one of the highest-profile risks facing participants in the financial markets. Despite this, relatively little is known about how counterparty credit risk is actually priced. We examine this issue using an extensive proprietary data set of contemporaneous CDS transaction prices and quotes by 14 different CDS dealers selling credit protection on the same underlying firm. This unique cross-sectional data set allows us to identify directly how dealers' credit risk affects the prices of these controversial credit derivatives. We find that counterparty credit risk is priced in the CDS market. The magnitude of the effect, however, is vanishingly small and is consistent with a market structure in which participants require collateralization of swap liabilities by counterparties.","['Navneet Arora', 'Priyank Gandhi', 'Francis A.

What does futures market interest tell us about the macroeconomy and asset prices?,"Economists have traditionally viewed futures prices as fully informative about future economic activity and asset prices. We argue that open interest could be more informative than futures prices in the presence of hedging demand and limited risk absorption capacity in futures markets. We find that movements in open interest are highly pro-cyclical, correlated with both macroeconomic activity and movements in asset prices. Movements in commodity market interest predict commodity returns, bond returns, and movements in the short rate even after controlling for other known predictors. To a lesser degree, movements in open interest predict returns in currency, bond, and stock markets.","['Harrison Hong', 'Motohiro Yogo']","['Bonds', 'Business cycle', 'Commodities', 'Currencies', 'Futures market', 'Inflation']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000657,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,3,Harrison Hong,2012,169.29798886570848
Profitability and capital structure: Evidence from import penetration,"Firms experiencing increases in import competition significantly reduce their leverage ratios by issuing equity and selling assets to repay debt.

Doing battle with short sellers: The conflicted role of blockholders in bear raids,"If short sellers can destroy firm value by manipulating prices down, an informed blockholder has a powerful natural incentive to protect the value of his stake by trading against them. However, he also has a potentially conflicting incentive to use his information to generate trading profits. We show that a speculator can exploit this conflict and force the blockholder to buy a disproportionately large amount to prevent value destruction. This is costly for the blockholder because the trades must sometimes be executed at inflated prices. Given reasonable constraints on short sellers, a sufficiently large blockholder will have the incentive to absorb these losses and prevent a bear raid. However, conditions exist under which outside intervention may be warranted.","['Naveen Khanna', 'Richmond D.

We test whether empirical asset pricing models capture the value and momentum patterns in international average returns and whether asset pricing seems to be integrated across the four regions. Integrated pricing across regions does not get strong support in our tests. For three regions (North America, Europe, and Japan), local models that use local explanatory returns provide passable descriptions of local average returns for portfolios formed on size and value versus growth.

Incentives to innovate and financial crises,"In this paper I develop a model of a competitive financial system with unrestricted but costly entry and an endogenously determined number of competing financial institutions (“banks” for short). Banks can make standard loans on which plentiful historical data are available and unanimous agreement exists on default probabilities. Or banks can innovate and make new loans on which limited historical data are available, leading to possible disagreement over default probabilities. In equilibrium, banks make zero profits on standard loans and positive profits on innovative loans, which engenders innovation incentives for banks. But innovation brings with it the risk that investors could disagree with the bank that the loan is worthy of continued funding and hence could withdraw funding at an interim stage, precipitating a financial crisis. The degree of innovation in the financial system is determined by this trade-off. Welfare implications of financial innovation and mechanisms to reduce the probability of crises are discussed.",['Anjan V.

Securitization without adverse selection: The case of CLOs,"In this paper, we investigate whether securitization was associated with risky lending in the corporate loan market by examining the performance of individual loans held by collateralized loan obligations. We employ two different data sets that identify loan holdings for a large set of CLOs and find that adverse selection problems in corporate loan securitizations are less severe than commonly believed. Using a battery of performance tests, we find that loans securitized before 2005 performed no worse than comparable unsecuritized loans originated by the same bank. Even loans originated by the bank that acts as the CLO underwriter do not show under-performance relative to the rest of the CLO portfolio. While some evidence exists of under-performance for securitized loans originated between 2005 and 2007, it is not consistent across samples, performance measures, and horizons. Overall, we argue that the securitization of corporate loans is fundamentally different from securitization of other assets classes because securitized loans are fractions of syndicated loans. Therefore, mechanisms used to align incentives in a lending syndicate are likely to reduce adverse selection in the choice of CLO collateral.","['Efraim Benmelech', 'Jennifer Dlugosz', 'Victoria Ivashina']","['Structured finance', 'Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)', 'CDOs', 'Syndicated loans']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000773,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,1,Efraim Benmelech,2012,169.29798886570848
Delegated trading and the speed of adjustment in security prices,"Institutional trading arrangements often involve the portfolio manager delegating the task of trade execution to a separate division within the firm.

We hypothesize that aggregate contrarian trading resulting from widespread application of such benchmarks leads to delays in the assimilation of information in security prices. Using institutional trading data, we document the hypothesized contrarian trading pattern and relate the pattern to price-adjustment delays in the response of individual stocks to index futures returns.

We solve a life-cycle model with longevity risk, which can be hedged through endogenous saving and retirement decisions. We investigate the benefits of financial assets designed to hedge the shocks to survival probabilities. When longevity risk is calibrated to match forward-looking projections, those benefits are substantial. This lends support to the idea that such hedging should be pursued by defined benefit pension plans on behalf of their beneficiaries. Finally, we draw implications for optimal security design.","['João F. Cocco', 'Francisco J.

Peer performance and stock market entry,"Peer performance can influence the adoption of financial innovations and investment styles. We present evidence of this type of social influence: recent stock returns that local peers experience affect an individual's stock market entry decision, particularly in areas with better opportunities for social learning. The likelihood of entry does not decrease as returns fall below zero, consistent with people not talking about decisions that have produced inferior outcomes. Market returns, media coverage, local stocks, omitted local variables, short sales constraints, and stock purchases within households do not seem to explain these results.","['Markku Kaustia', 'Samuli Knüpfer']","['Investor behavior', 'Peer effect', 'Social interaction', 'Social influence', 'Stock market participation']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001449,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,104,2,Markku Kaustia,2012,169.29798886570848
The effect of reference point prices on mergers and acquisitions,"Prior stock price peaks of targets affect several aspects of merger and acquisition activity. Offer prices are biased toward recent peak prices although they are economically unremarkable. An offer's probability of acceptance jumps discontinuously when it exceeds a peak price. Conversely, bidder shareholders react more negatively as the offer price is influenced upward toward a peak. Merger waves occur when high returns on the market and likely targets make it easier for bidders to offer a peak price. Parties thus appear to use recent peaks as reference points or anchors to simplify the complex tasks of valuation and negotiation.","['Malcolm Baker', 'Xin Pan', 'Jeffrey Wurgler']","['Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'Offer price', 'Reference point', 'Behavioral corporate finance']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000712,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,1,Malcolm Baker,2012,169.29798886570848
The sources of value destruction in acquisitions by entrenched managers,"Prior work has established that entrenched managers make value-decreasing acquisitions. In this study, we determine how they destroy that value. Overall, we find that value destruction by entrenched managers comes from a combination of factors. First, they disproportionately avoid private targets, which have been shown to be generally associated with value creation. Second, when they do buy private targets or public targets with blockholders, they tend not to use all-equity offers, which has the effect of avoiding the transfer of a valuable blockholder to the bidder. We further test whether entrenched managers simply overpay for good targets or choose targets with lower synergies. We find that while they overpay, they also choose low synergy targets in the first place, as shown by combined announcement returns and post-merger operating performance.","['Jarrad Harford', 'Mark Humphery-Jenner', 'Ronan Powell']","['Corporate governance', 'Mergers', 'Entrenchment', 'Blockholders', 'Overpayment']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001110,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,2,Jarrad Harford,2012,169.29798886570848
Cash flows and leverage adjustments,"Recent research has emphasized the impact of transaction costs on firm leverage adjustments. We recognize that cashflow realizations can provide opportunities to adjust leverage at relatively low marginal cost. We find that a firm's cashflow features affect not only the leverage target, but also the speed of adjustment toward that target. Heterogeneity in adjustment speeds is driven by an economically meaningful concept: adjustment costs. Accounting for this fact produces adjustment speeds that are significantly faster than previously estimated in the literature. We also analyze how both financial constraints and market timing variables affect adjustments toward a leverage target.","['Michael Faulkender', 'Mark J.

Furthermore, this contagion in loan spreads is mitigated in concentrated industries, consistent with the hypothesis and evidence in Lang and Stulz (1992) that bankruptcy filings in concentrated industries can have positive consequences for rivals (increased market share and/or power).

Do option markets undo restrictions on short sales? Evidence from the 2008 short-sale ban,The effectiveness of any sanction depends on the costs of avoiding its restrictions. We examine whether bearish option strategies were substitutes for short sales during the September 2008 short-sale ban. We find a significant diminution in option volumes and a significant increase in option bid-ask spreads for banned stock relative to unbanned stock during the ban period. Apparent violations of the put-call parity bound became significantly more frequent for banned stocks during the ban period. We conclude that the ban acted as an effective restriction on trading in options.,"['Bruce D.

Arbitrage crashes and the speed of capital,"The imminent failure of prime brokers during the 2008 financial crisis caused a sudden decrease in the leverage afforded hedge funds. This decrease resulted from the asymmetrical payoff to rehypothecation lenders—the ultimate financiers, through prime brokers, to hedge funds. Seemingly long-term debt capital became short-term capital creating a duration mismatch between left-hand side arbitrage opportunities and right-hand side liabilities. Consequently, arbitrageurs became unable to maintain similar prices of similar assets. Mispricing magnitudes, and the time required to correct them, reflect the role of arbitrageurs in maintaining accurate prices during normal times and offer an estimate of discounts at which assets transact during crises.","['Mark Mitchell', 'Todd Pulvino']","['Arbitrage', 'Financial crisis', 'Hedge funds']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001991,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,104,3,Mark Mitchell,2012,169.29798886570848

These patterns persist in tests that consider the effects of earnings restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and the possible endogeneity of CEO turnover and earnings management. The relation between earnings management and forced turnover occurs both in firms with good and bad performance, and when the accruals work to inflate or deflate reported earnings. These results indicate that boards tend to act proactively to discipline managers who manage earnings aggressively, before the manipulations lead to costly external consequences.","['Sonali Hazarika', 'Jonathan M.

Securitized banking and the run on repo,"The panic of 2007–2008 was a run on the sale and repurchase market (the repo market), which is a very large, short-term market that provides financing for a wide range of securitization activities and financial institutions. Repo transactions are collateralized, frequently with securitized bonds. We refer to the combination of securitization plus repo finance as “securitized banking” and argue that these activities were at the nexus of the crisis. We use a novel data set that includes credit spreads for hundreds of securitized bonds to trace the path of the crisis from subprime-housing related assets into markets that had no connection to housing. We find that changes in the LIB-OIS spread, a proxy for counterparty risk, were strongly correlated with changes in credit spreads and repo rates for securitized bonds. These changes implied higher uncertainty about bank solvency and lower values for repo collateral. Concerns about the liquidity of markets for the bonds used as collateral led to increases in repo haircuts, that is the amount of collateral required for any given transaction. With declining asset values and increasing haircuts, the US banking system was effectively insolvent for the first time since the Great Depression.","['Gary Gorton', 'Andrew Metrick']","['Financial crisis', 'Panic', 'Sale and repurchase', 'Securitization', 'Subprime']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1100081X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,104,3,Gary Gorton,2012,169.29798886570848
Information effect of entry into credit ratings market: The case of insurers' ratings,"The paper analyzes the effect of competition between credit rating agencies (CRAs) on the information content of ratings. We show that a monopolistic CRA pools sellers into multiple rating classes and has partial market coverage. This provides an opportunity for market entry. The entrant designs a rating scale distinct from that of the incumbent. It targets higher-than-average companies in each rating grade of the incumbent's rating scale and employs more stringent rating standards. We use Standard and Poor's (S&P) entry into the market for insurance ratings previously covered by a monopolist, A.M. Best, to empirically test the impact of entry on the information content of ratings. The empirical analysis reveals that S&P required higher standards to assign a rating similar to the one assigned by A.M. Best and that higher-than-average quality insurers in each rating category of A.M. Best chose to receive a second rating from S&P.","['Neil A. Doherty', 'Anastasia V. Kartasheva', 'Richard D.

"Executive stock options, differential risk-taking incentives, and firm value","The sensitivity of stock options' payoff to return volatility, or vega, provides risk-averse CEOs with an incentive to increase their firms' risk more by increasing systematic rather than idiosyncratic risk. This effect manifests because any increase in the firm's systematic risk can be hedged by a CEO who can trade the market portfolio. Consistent with this prediction, we find that vega gives CEOs incentives to increase their firms' total risk by increasing systematic risk but not idiosyncratic risk. Collectively, our results suggest that stock options might not always encourage managers to pursue projects that are primarily characterized by idiosyncratic risk when projects with systematic risk are available as an alternative.","['Christopher S.

Expropriation risk and technology,This paper develops a unified framework to analyze the dynamics of firm investment in countries with poor legal enforcement. The firm's technology edge over the government generates endogenous property rights. Industry variation in the technology gap predicts a sectoral pecking-order of expropriations. Long-run investment distortions may be Pareto superior relative to persistent investment at the static optimum. The dynamics of investment and transfers depend on whether incentives (backloading) or efficiency (frontloading) concerns dominate at the initial division of surplus. An increase in government efficiency may reduce its welfare. The model provides a technology-driven rationale for the widespread use of conglomerate structures in emerging market countries.,['Marcus M.

Using various proxies for product market competition, and reductions of import tariff rates to capture exogenous changes to a firm's competitive environment, I find that competition has a significantly positive effect on the cost of bank debt. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the effect of competition is greater in industries in which small firms face financially strong rivals, in industries with intense strategic interactions between firms, and in illiquid industries. Overall, these findings suggest that banks price financial contracts by taking into account the risk that arises from product market competition.",['Philip Valta'],"['Product market competition', 'Import tariffs', 'Cost of debt', 'Bank loans']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000645,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,3,Philip Valta,2012,169.29798886570848

Bankruptcy spillover effects on strategic alliance partners,"This paper examines whether a party to a strategic alliance or joint venture suffers from spillover effects when the other partner files for bankruptcy. We find that the non-bankrupt strategic alliance partners, on average, experience a negative stock price reaction around their partner firm's bankruptcy filing announcement. This negative effect is strongest for longer partnerships and those with higher returns at the announcement of the initial alliance formation. Furthermore, horizontal alliance firms in declining industries have lower returns, indicating that industry conditions can exacerbate expected problems for the non-bankrupt firm. Non-bankrupt partners also experience drops in profit margins and investment levels in the subsequent two years with the worst performance concentrated among the longer-term agreements. There is very little impact on the returns or performance for joint venture partners, which suggests that these agreements are more insulating for the partner firm.","['Audra L. Boone', 'Vladimir I.

Stock returns after major price shocks: The impact of information,"This paper focuses on stocks that experience major price changes. Using analyst reports as a proxy, I find that price events accompanied by information are followed by drift, while no-information ones result in reversals. One interpretation of these results is that investors underreact to news about fundamentals and overreact to other shocks that move stock prices. Consistent with this hypothesis, information-based price changes are more strongly correlated with future earnings surprises than no-information ones. Furthermore, drift exists only when the direction of the price move and of the change in analyst recommendations have the same sign. Finally, the ratio of no-information to information-based price shocks is strongly correlated with aggregate implied volatility and also forecasts momentum returns.",['Pavel G.

How (not) to pay for advice: A framework for consumer financial protection,"This paper investigates the determinants of the compensation structure for brokers who advise customers regarding the suitability of financial products. Our model explains why brokers are commonly compensated indirectly through contingent commissions paid by product providers, even though this compensation structure could lead to biased advice. When customers are wary of the adviser's incentives, contingent commissions can be an effective incentive tool to induce the adviser to learn which specialized product is most suitable for the specific needs of customers. If, instead, customers naively believe they receive unbiased advice, high product prices and correspondingly high commissions become a tool of exploitation. Policy intervention that mandates disclosure of commissions can protect naive consumers and increase welfare. However, prohibiting or capping commissions could have the unintended consequence of stifling the adviser's incentive to acquire information. More vigorous competition benefits consumers and reduces exploitation, but firms have limited incentives to educate naive customers.","['Roman Inderst', 'Marco Ottaviani']","['Brokers', 'Financial advisers', 'Commissions', 'Consumer financial protection', 'Disclosure']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000074,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,2,Roman Inderst,2012,169.29798886570848
Systematic risk and the cross section of hedge fund returns,"This paper investigates the extent to which market risk, residual risk, and tail risk explain the cross-sectional dispersion in hedge fund returns. The paper introduces a comprehensive measure of systematic risk (SR) for individual hedge funds by breaking up total risk into systematic and fund-specific or residual risk components. Contrary to the popular understanding that hedge funds are market neutral, we find that systematic risk is a highly significant factor explaining the dispersion of cross-sectional returns while at the same time measures of residual risk and tail risk seem to have little explanatory power. Funds in the highest SR quintile generate 6% more average annual returns compared with funds in the lowest SR quintile. After controlling for a large set of fund characteristics and risk factors, systematic risk remains positive and highly significant, whereas the relation between residual risk and future fund returns continues to be insignificant. Hence, systematic risk is a powerful determinant of the cross-sectional differences in hedge fund returns.","['Turan G. Bali', 'Stephen J.

Using hand-collected data on firm applications for capital under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), we find that politically connected firms are more likely to be funded, controlling for other characteristics. Yet investments in politically connected firms underperform those in unconnected firms.

Did securitization affect the cost of corporate debt?,"This paper investigates whether the securitization of corporate bank loan facilities had an impact on the price of corporate debt. Our results suggest that loan facilities that are subsequently securitized are associated with a 17 basis point lower spread than that of facilities that are not subsequently securitized. We consider facility characteristics that are associated with the likelihood of securitization and estimate the extent to which these characteristics are related to spreads. We document that Term Loan B facilities, facilities of B-rated firms, and facilities originated by banks that originate CLOs are securitized more frequently than other facilities. Spreads on facilities estimated to be more likely to be subsequently securitized have lower spreads than otherwise similar facilities. The results are consistent with the view that securitization caused a reduction in the cost of capital.","['Taylor D. Nadauld', 'Michael S.

Structural models and endogeneity in corporate finance: The link between managerial ownership and corporate performance,"This paper presents a parsimonious, structural model that isolates primary economic determinants of the level and dispersion of managerial ownership, firm scale, and performance and the empirical associations among them. In particular, variation across firms and through time of estimated productivity parameters for physical assets and managerial input and corresponding variation in optimal compensation contract and firm size combine to deliver the well-known hump-shaped relation between Tobin's Q and managerial ownership. To assess the effectiveness of standard econometric approaches to the endogeneity problem, we apply those remedies to panel data generated from the model. The unfortunate conclusion is that, at least in the ownership–performance context, proxy variables, fixed effects, and instrumental variables do not generally provide reliable solutions to simultaneity bias.","['Jeffrey L.

Banks with large exposure to mortgage-backed securities also provision less for bad loans. Furthermore, distressed banks use discretion over the classification of mortgage-backed securities to inflate their books.

The flight home effect: Evidence from the syndicated loan market during financial crises,This paper shows that the collapse of the global market for syndicated loans during financial crises can in part be explained by a flight home effect whereby lenders rebalance their loan portfolios in favor of domestic borrowers. The home bias of lenders' loan origination increases by approximately 20% if the bank's home country experiences a banking crisis. This flight home effect is distinct from flight to quality because borrowers of different quality are equally affected.

Trust and delegation,"This paper studies operational risk in the hedge fund industry using due diligence reports. Many funds suffer from operational problems, including limited disclosure of legal and regulatory issues. We use direct evidence of inadequate or failed internal processes to derive a canonical correlation-based measure for operational risk consistent with the Basel definition.

"Optimal capital structure, bargaining, and the supplier market structure","This paper studies the relationship between firm leverage and supplier market structure. We find that firm leverage decreases with the degree of competition between suppliers. Specifically, leverage decreases with the elasticity of substitution between suppliers. Leverage also decreases with the number of suppliers when the elasticity of substitution is high, and increases with the number of suppliers when the elasticity is low. We also provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the model predictions.",['Yongqiang Chu'],"['Capital structure', 'Suppliers', 'Bargaining', 'Relation-specific investment']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000815,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,2,Yongqiang Chu,2012,169.29798886570848
"Tournament incentives, firm risk, and corporate policies","This paper tests the proposition that higher tournament incentives will result in greater risk-taking by senior managers in order to increase their chance of promotion to the rank of CEO. Measuring tournament incentives as the pay gap between the CEO and the next layer of senior managers, we find a significantly positive relation between firm risk and tournament incentives. Further, we find that greater tournament incentives lead to higher R&D intensity, firm focus, and leverage, but lower capital expenditures intensity. Our results support the hypothesis that option-like features of intra-organizational CEO promotion tournaments provide incentives to senior executives to increase firm risk by following riskier policies. Finally, the compensation levels and structures of executives of financial institutions have received a great deal of scrutiny after the financial crisis. In a separate examination of financial firms, we again find a significantly positive relation between firm risk and tournament incentives.","['Omesh Kini', 'Ryan Williams']","['Tournament incentives', 'Firm risk', 'Corporate policies']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11002157,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,103,2,Omesh Kini,2012,169.29798886570848
"Local investors, price discovery, and market efficiency","This study examines the effect of locally informed investors on market efficiency and stock prices using large power outages, which are exogenous events that constrain trading. Turnover in stocks headquartered in an outage area with 0.5% of U.S. electrical customers drops by 3–7% on the first full day of the outage, and bid–ask spreads narrow by 2.5%. Firm-specific price volatility is 2.3% lower on blackout dates. This effect is larger for smaller, lesser-known stocks and in higher income areas. Consistent with a valuation discount and higher expected returns for stocks with more informed traders, firms with a one-standard-deviation higher local trading propensity have market-to-book values that are 5% lower, Tobin's Q that is 6% lower, annualized four-factor alphas that are 1.2% higher, and average spreads that are 6.5% higher.

The short of it: Investor sentiment and anomalies,"This study explores the role of investor sentiment in a broad set of anomalies in cross-sectional stock returns. We consider a setting in which the presence of market-wide sentiment is combined with the argument that overpricing should be more prevalent than underpricing, due to short-sale impediments. Long-short strategies that exploit the anomalies exhibit profits consistent with this setting. First, each anomaly is stronger (its long-short strategy is more profitable) following high levels of sentiment. Second, the short leg of each strategy is more profitable following high sentiment. Finally, sentiment exhibits no relation to returns on the long legs of the strategies.","['Robert F.

Disclosure and agency conflict: Evidence from mutual fund commission bundling,"This study provides empirical evidence on the role of disclosure in resolving agency conflicts in delegated investment management. For certain expenditures, fund managers have alternative means of payment which differ greatly in their opacity: payments can be expensed (relatively transparent); or bundled with brokerage commissions (relatively opaque). We find that the return impact of opaque payments is significantly more negative than that of transparent payments. Moreover, we find a differential flow reaction that confirms the opacity of commission bundling. Collectively, our results demonstrate the importance of transparency in addressing agency costs of delegated investment management.","['Roger M. Edelen', 'Richard B. Evans', 'Gregory B.

The credit crisis around the globe: Why did some banks perform better?,"Though overall bank performance from July 2007 to December 2008 was the worst since the Great Depression, there is significant variation in the cross-section of stock returns of large banks across the world during that period. We use this variation to evaluate the importance of factors that have been put forth as having contributed to the poor performance of banks during the credit crisis. The evidence is supportive of theories that emphasize the fragility of banks financed with short-term capital market funding. The better-performing banks had less leverage and lower returns immediately before the crisis. Differences in banking regulations across countries are generally uncorrelated with the performance of banks during the crisis, except that large banks from countries with more restrictions on bank activities performed better and decreased loans less. Our evidence poses a substantial challenge to those who argue that poor bank governance was a major cause of the crisis because we find that banks with more shareholder-friendly boards performed significantly worse during the crisis than other banks, were not less risky before the crisis, and reduced loans more during the crisis.","['Andrea Beltratti', 'René M.

Corporate ownership structure and bank loan syndicate structure,"Using a novel data set on corporate ownership and control, we show that the divergence between the control rights and cash-flow rights of a borrowing firm's largest ultimate owner has a significant impact on the concentration and composition of the firm's loan syndicate. When the control-ownership divergence is large, lead arrangers form syndicates with structures that facilitate enhanced due diligence and monitoring efforts. These syndicates tend to be relatively concentrated and composed of domestic banks that are geographically close to the borrowing firms and that have lending expertise related to the industries of the borrowers. We also examine factors that influence the relation between ownership structure and syndicate structure, including lead arranger reputation, prior lending relationship, borrowing firm informational opacity, presence of multiple large owners, laws and institutions, and financial crises.","['Chen Lin', 'Yue Ma', 'Paul Malatesta', 'Yuhai Xuan']","['Ownership structure', 'Excess control rights', 'Syndicated loans']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11002388,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,104,1,Chen Lin,2012,169.29798886570848
Red and blue investing: Values and finance,"Using data on the political contributions and stock holdings of U.S. investment managers, we find that mutual fund managers who make campaign donations to Democrats hold less of their portfolios (relative to non-donors or Republican donors) in companies that are deemed socially irresponsible (e.g., tobacco, guns, or defense firms or companies with bad employee relations or diversity records). Although explicit socially responsible investing (SRI) funds are more likely to be managed by Democratic managers, this result holds for non-SRI funds and after controlling for other fund and manager characteristics.

Testing conditional factor models,"Using nonparametric techniques, we develop a methodology for estimating and testing conditional alphas and betas and long-run alphas and betas, which are the averages of conditional alphas and betas, respectively, across time. The estimators and tests can be implemented for a single asset or jointly across portfolios. The traditional Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989) test arises as a special case of no time variation in the alphas and factor loadings and homoskedasticity. As applications of the methodology, we estimate conditional CAPM and multifactor models on book-to-market and momentum decile portfolios. We reject the null that long-run alphas are equal to zero even though there is substantial variation in the conditional factor loadings of these portfolios.","['Andrew Ang', 'Dennis Kristensen']","['Nonparametric estimator', 'Time-varying beta', 'Conditional alpha', 'Book-to-market premium', 'Value and momentum']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000694,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,1,Andrew Ang,2012,169.29798886570848
The role of institutional investors in propagating the crisis of 2007–2008,"Using novel data on investors' bond portfolios, we study the contagion of the crisis from securitized bonds to corporate bonds. When securitized bonds became “toxic” in August 2007, mutual funds retained the now illiquid securitized bonds and sold corporate bonds. Funds with negative flows or high liquidity needs liquidated more than others. Yield spreads increased more for corporate bonds whose pre-crisis bondholders were more heavily exposed to securitized bonds, compared to same-issuer bonds held by unexposed investors. The findings suggest that liquidity-constrained investors with exposure to securitized bonds played a role in propagating the crisis from securitized to corporate bonds.","['Alberto Manconi', 'Massimo Massa', 'Ayako Yasuda']","['Crisis transmission', 'Securitized bonds', 'Corporate bonds', 'Liquidity channel']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001231,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,104,3,Alberto Manconi,2012,169.29798886570848
Adverse selection in mortgage securitization,"Using several large data sets of mortgage loans originated between 2004 and 2007, we find that in the prime mortgage market, banks generally sold low-default-risk loans into the secondary market while retaining higher-default-risk loans in their portfolios. In contrast, these lenders retained loans with lower prepayment risk relative to loans they sold. Securitization strategy of lenders changed dramatically in 2007 as the crisis set in with most unwilling to retain higher-default-risk loans in return for lower prepayment risk. Contrary to the prime market, the subprime market does not exhibit any clear pattern of adverse selection.","['Sumit Agarwal', 'Yan Chang', 'Abdullah Yavas']","['Mortgage', 'Securitization', 'Default', 'Adverse selection']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1200075X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,3,Sumit Agarwal,2012,169.29798886570848
Do foreigners facilitate information transmission in emerging markets?,"Using the degree of accessibility of foreign investors to emerging stock markets, or investibility, as a proxy for the extent of foreign investments, we assess whether investibility has a significant influence on the diffusion of global market information across stocks in emerging markets. We show that greater investibility reduces price delay to global market information. We also find that returns of highly investible stocks lead those of noninvestible stocks because they incorporate global information more quickly. These results are consistent with the idea that financial liberalization in the form of greater investibility yields informationally more efficient stock prices in emerging markets.","['Kee-Hong Bae', 'Arzu Ozoguz', 'Hongping Tan', 'Tony S.

"Litigation risk, strategic disclosure and the underpricing of initial public offerings","Using word content analysis on the time-series of IPO prospectuses, we show that issuers tradeoff underpricing and strategic disclosure as potential hedges against litigation risk. This tradeoff explains a significant fraction of the variation in prospectus revision patterns, IPO underpricing, the partial adjustment phenomenon, and litigation outcomes. We find that strong disclosure is an effective hedge against all types of lawsuits. Underpricing, however, is an effective hedge only against Section 11 lawsuits, those lawsuits which are most damaging to the underwriter. Underwriters who fail to adequately hedge litigation risk experience economically large penalties, including loss of market share.","['Kathleen Weiss Hanley', 'Gerard Hoberg']","['Litigation risk', 'Initial public offerings', 'Initial returns', 'Partial adjustment', 'Strategic disclosure']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11002169,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,103,2,Kathleen Weiss Hanley,2012,169.29798886570848
Corporate bond liquidity before and after the onset of the subprime crisis,"We analyze liquidity components of corporate bond spreads during 2005–2009 using a new robust illiquidity measure. The spread contribution from illiquidity increases dramatically with the onset of the subprime crisis. The increase is slow and persistent for investment grade bonds while the effect is stronger but more short-lived for speculative grade bonds. Bonds become less liquid when financial distress hits a lead underwriter and the liquidity of bonds issued by financial firms dries up under crises.

CAPM for estimating the cost of equity capital: Interpreting the empirical evidence,"We argue that the empirical evidence against the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) based on stock returns does not invalidate its use for estimating the cost of capital for projects in making capital budgeting decisions. Because stocks are backed not only by projects in place, but also by the options to modify current projects and undertake new ones, the expected returns on stocks need not satisfy the CAPM even when expected returns of projects do. We provide empirical support for our arguments by developing a method for estimating firms' project CAPM betas and project returns. Our findings justify the continued use of the CAPM by firms in spite of the mounting evidence against it based on the cross section of stock returns.","['Zhi Da', 'Re-Jin Guo', 'Ravi Jagannathan']","['CAPM', 'Asset pricing anomalies', 'Cost of capital', 'Beta', 'Capital budgeting']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001942,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,103,1,Zhi Da,2012,169.29798886570848
Dynamic jump intensities and risk premiums: Evidence from S&P500 returns and options,"We build a new class of discrete-time models that are relatively easy to estimate using returns and/or options. The distribution of returns is driven by two factors: dynamic volatility and dynamic jump intensity. Each factor has its own risk premium. The models significantly outperform standard models without jumps when estimated on S&P500 returns. We find very strong support for time-varying jump intensities. Compared to the risk premium on dynamic volatility, the risk premium on the dynamic jump intensity has a much larger impact on option prices. We confirm these findings using joint estimation on returns and large option samples.","['Peter Christoffersen', 'Kris Jacobs', 'Chayawat Ornthanalai']","['Compound Poisson jumps', 'Analytical filtering', 'Fat tails', 'Risk premiums']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001122,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,3,Peter Christoffersen,2012,169.29798886570848
(Interstate) Banking and (interstate) trade: Does real integration follow financial integration?,"We conjecture that banks present in two regions charge the appropriate risk premiums for trade-related projects between these markets, whereas higher rates are charged for projects involving shipments to markets where they are absent. These differences affect regional trade flows. US interstate banking deregulation serves as a natural experiment to test our model's implication with the Commodity Flow Survey data. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the trade share of state-pairs that allowed pairwise interstate entry increased by 14% over 10 years relative to non-integrated state-pairs.

Banks swap assets to diversify their individual risk. Two asset structures arise. In a clustered structure, groups of banks hold common asset portfolios and default together. In an unclustered structure, defaults are more dispersed. Portfolio quality of individual banks is opaque but can be inferred by creditors from aggregate signals about bank solvency. When bank debt is short-term, creditors do not roll over in response to adverse signals and all banks are inefficiently liquidated. This information contagion is more likely under clustered asset structures.

A diversified portfolio of time series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and performs best during extreme markets.

Limited arbitrage between equity and credit markets,"We document that short-horizon pricing discrepancies across firms' equity and credit markets are common and that an economically significant proportion of these are anomalous, indicating a lack of integration between the two markets. Proposing a statistical measure of market integration, we investigate whether equity–credit market integration is related to impediments to arbitrage. We find that time variation in integration across a firm's equity and credit markets is related to firm-specific impediments to arbitrage such as liquidity in equity and credit markets and idiosyncratic risk. Our evidence provides a potential resolution to the puzzle of why Merton model hedge ratios match empirically observed stock-bond elasticities (Schaefer and Strebulaev, 2008) and yet the model is limited in its ability to explain the integration between equity and credit markets (Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin, 2001).","['Nikunj Kapadia', 'Xiaoling Pu']","['Limited arbitrage', 'Market integration', 'Merton model', 'Capital structure arbitrage']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000670,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,3,Nikunj Kapadia,2012,169.29798886570848

Indeed, our analysis indicates that the liquidity premium in equities emanates predominantly from the sell-order side.

We also find that predictive models with constant coefficients are dominated by models with time-varying coefficients. Finally, we show a strong link between out-of-sample predictability and the business cycle.","['Thomas Dangl', 'Michael Halling']","['Empirical asset pricing', 'Equity return prediction', 'Bayesian econometrics']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000633,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,1,Thomas Dangl,2012,169.29798886570848
Vertical integration to avoid contracting with potential competitors: Evidence from bankers' banks,"We examine a vertical integration decision within the commercial banking industry. During the last quarter of the 20th century, some community banks reduced their traditional reliance on correspondent banks for upstream products and services by joining bankers' banks, a form of business cooperative. Research on vertical integration focuses primarily on firm-specific investment, market power, and government regulation. However, this case is difficult to explain in terms of these standard vertical integration motives. Our evidence suggests that bankers' banks are a response to technological change and deregulation that results in increased costs faced by community banks in dealing with correspondent banks as both suppliers and potential competitors. For instance, loan participations require sharing proprietary information about major loan customers, something a community bank would not want to provide to a potential competitor.","['James A.

Public market staging: The timing of capital infusions in newly public firms,"We examine financing activities of newly public firms for evidence on capital staging in the public equity market. Staging (sequential financing) can increase issuance costs but can limit costs associated with overinvestment. We find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that staging is employed to help control the overinvestment problem in public firms. Initial public offering (IPO) proceeds, relative to external financing requirements, are smaller for firms with more intangible assets and more research and development (R&D)-intensive firms. Asset intangibility and R&D intensity are also both negatively related to the length of time from a firm's IPO to its first post-IPO capital infusion.","['Michael G. Hertzel', 'Mark R.

Understanding commonality in liquidity around the world,"We examine how commonality in liquidity varies across countries and over time in ways related to supply determinants (funding liquidity of financial intermediaries) and demand determinants (correlated trading behavior of international and institutional investors, incentives to trade individual securities, and investor sentiment) of liquidity. Commonality in liquidity is greater in countries with and during times of high market volatility (especially, large market declines), greater presence of international investors, and more correlated trading activity. Our evidence is more reliably consistent with demand-side explanations and challenges the ability of the funding liquidity hypothesis to help us understand important aspects of financial market liquidity around the world, even during the recent financial crisis.","['G.

The seeds of a crisis: A theory of bank liquidity and risk taking over the business cycle,"We examine how the banking sector could ignite the formation of asset price bubbles when there is access to abundant liquidity. Inside banks, to induce effort, loan officers are compensated based on the volume of loans. Volume-based compensation also induces greater risk taking; however, due to lack of commitment, loan officers are penalized ex post only if banks suffer a high enough liquidity shortfall. Outside banks, when there is heightened macroeconomic risk, investors reduce direct investment and hold more bank deposits. This ‘flight to quality’ leaves banks flush with liquidity, lowering the sensitivity of bankers’ payoffs to downside risks and inducing excessive credit volume and asset price bubbles. The seeds of a crisis are thus sown.","['Viral Acharya', 'Hassan Naqvi']","['Bubbles', 'Flight to quality', 'Moral hazard']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000967,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,2,Viral Acharya,2012,169.29798886570848
Financial constraints and share repurchases,"We examine how the financial constraints of repurchasing firms affect their post-buyback performance. By every constraint measure we use, a set of constrained firms repurchase. They display significantly poorer post-buyback abnormal return and operating performance than unconstrained firms. Financial constraints are more important in explaining the performance of share buybacks for firms with high actual repurchase ratios. Constrained firms, especially those with high actual repurchase ratios, experience a significantly greater increase in post-buyback distress risk than unconstrained firms. Managerial hubris could explain why constrained firms buy back shares even if the buybacks do not improve shareholder wealth.","['Sheng-Syan Chen', 'Yanzhi Wang']","['Share repurchase', 'Financial constraint', 'Corporate liquidity', 'Managerial hubris']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000402,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,2,Sheng-Syan Chen,2012,169.29798886570848
Board connections and M&A transactions,"We examine M&A transactions between firms with current board connections and find that acquirers obtain higher announcement returns in transactions with a first-degree connection where the acquirer and the target share a common director. Acquirer returns are also higher in transactions with a second-degree connection where one acquirer director and one target director serve on the same third board. Our results suggest that first-degree connections benefit acquirers with lower takeover premiums while second-degree connections benefit acquirers with greater value creation.

The high volume return premium: Cross-country evidence,"We examine the high volume return premium across 41 different countries and find it to be a phenomenon found in both developed and emerging markets. The premium is not caused by systematic differences in risk or liquidity. Using Merton's (1987) investor recognition hypothesis as a guide, we find the magnitude of the premium is generally associated with country and firm characteristics hypothesized to affect returns subsequent to a change in a stock's visibility.

The option to stock volume ratio and future returns,"We examine the information content of option and equity volumes when trade direction is unobserved. In a multimarket asymmetric information model, equity short-sale costs result in a negative relation between relative option volume and future firm value. In our empirical tests, firms in the lowest decile of the option to stock volume ratio (O/S) outperform the highest decile by 0.34% per week (19.3% annualized). Our model and empirics both indicate that O/S is a stronger signal when short-sale costs are high or option leverage is low. O/S also predicts future firm-specific earnings news, consistent with O/S reflecting private information.","['Travis L. Johnson', 'Eric C.

Complicated firms,"We exploit a novel setting in which the same piece of information affects two sets of firms: one set of firms requires straightforward processing to update prices, while the other set requires more complicated analyses to incorporate the same piece of information into prices. We document substantial return predictability from the set of easy-to-analyze firms to their more complicated peers. Specifically, a simple portfolio strategy that takes advantage of this straightforward vs. complicated information processing classification yields returns of 118 basis points per month before transaction costs. Consistent with processing complexity driving the return relation, we further show that the more complicated the firm, the more pronounced the return predictability. In addition, we find that sell-side analysts are subject to these same information processing constraints, as their forecast revisions of easy-to-analyze firms predict their future revisions of more complicated firms.","['Lauren Cohen', 'Dong Lou']","['Complicated processing', 'Return predictability', 'Standalone', 'Conglomerate', 'Market frictions']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001899,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,104,2,Lauren Cohen,2012,169.29798886570848
Market fragility and international market crashes,"We extend the Pukthuanthong and Roll (2009) measure of integration to provide an estimate of systemic risk within international equity markets. Our measure indicates an increasing likelihood of market crashes. The conditional probability of market crashes increases substantially following increases of our risk measure. High levels of our risk measure indicate the probability of a global crash is greater than the probability of a local crash. That is, conditional on high levels of systemic risk, the probability of a severe crash across multiple markets is larger than the probability of a crash within a smaller number of markets.","['Dave Berger', 'Kuntara Pukthuanthong']","['Financial crises', 'Systemic risk', 'Crash', 'Fragility']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000463,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,3,Dave Berger,2012,169.29798886570848
How are shorts informed?,"We find that a substantial portion of short sellers' trading advantage comes from their ability to analyze publicly available information.

Further, we find that the most informed short sales are not from market makers but rather from clients, and we find only weak evidence that short sellers anticipate news events. Overall, the evidence suggests that public news provides valuable trading opportunities for short sellers who are skilled information processors.","['Joseph E. Engelberg', 'Adam V. Reed', 'Matthew C.

Analyzing data on CEOs' leverage in their most recent primary home purchases, we find a positive, economically relevant, robust relation between corporate and personal leverage in the cross-section and when examining CEO turnovers. The results are consistent with an endogenous matching of CEOs to firms based on preferences, as well as with CEOs imprinting their personal preferences on the firms they manage, particularly when governance is weaker. Besides enhancing our understanding of the determinants of corporate capital structures, the broader contribution of the paper is to show that CEOs' personal behavior can, in part, explain corporate financial behavior of the firms they manage.","['Henrik Cronqvist', 'Anil K.

We employ a wide range of liquidity measures and find that liquidity effects account for approximately 14% of the explained market-wide corporate yield spread changes.

We also estimate Heckman selection models that account for the endogeneity of diversification and dynamic panel generalized method of moments models that account for the endogeneity of both diversification and governance. We find that the diversification discount persists even with these controls for endogeneity. However, in selection models the discount disappears entirely when we introduce governance variables in the second stage, and in dynamic panel GMM models the discount narrows by 37% when we include governance variables.","['Daniel Hoechle', 'Markus Schmid', 'Ingo Walter', 'David Yermack']","['Organizational structure', 'Diversification', 'Firm valuation', 'Corporate governance']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001863,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,103,1,Daniel Hoechle,2012,169.29798886570848

"Neglected risks, financial innovation, and financial fragility","We present a standard model of financial innovation, in which intermediaries engineer securities with cash flows that investors seek, but modify two assumptions. First, investors (and possibly intermediaries) neglect certain unlikely risks. Second, investors demand securities with safe cash flows. Financial intermediaries cater to these preferences and beliefs by engineering securities perceived to be safe but exposed to neglected risks. Because the risks are neglected, security issuance is excessive. As investors eventually recognize these risks, they fly back to the safety of traditional securities and markets become fragile, even without leverage, precisely because the volume of new claims is excessive.","['Nicola Gennaioli', 'Andrei Shleifer', 'Robert Vishny']","['Banks', 'Local thinking', 'Crisis']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001176,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,104,3,Nicola Gennaioli,2012,169.29798886570848
Individual political contributions and firm performance,"We present evidence that individuals make political contributions strategically by targeting politicians with power to affect their economic well-being. Individuals in Congressional districts with greater industry clustering choose to support politicians with jurisdiction over the industry. Importantly, individual political contributions are associated with improvements in operating performance of firms in industry clusters. The relation between contributions and firm performance is strongest for poorly performing firms, firms closer to financial distress, and for contributions in close elections. The results imply that individual political contributions are valuable to firms, especially during bad economic times.","['Alexei V.

Econometric measures of connectedness and systemic risk in the finance and insurance sectors,"We propose several econometric measures of connectedness based on principal-components analysis and Granger-causality networks, and apply them to the monthly returns of hedge funds, banks, broker/dealers, and insurance companies. We find that all four sectors have become highly interrelated over the past decade, likely increasing the level of systemic risk in the finance and insurance industries through a complex and time-varying network of relationships. These measures can also identify and quantify financial crisis periods, and seem to contain predictive power in out-of-sample tests. Our results show an asymmetry in the degree of connectedness among the four sectors, with banks playing a much more important role in transmitting shocks than other financial institutions.","['Monica Billio', 'Mila Getmansky', 'Andrew W.

Currency momentum strategies,"We provide a broad empirical investigation of momentum strategies in the foreign exchange market. We find a significant cross-sectional spread in excess returns of up to 10% per annum (p.a.) between past winner and loser currencies. This spread in excess returns is not explained by traditional risk factors, it is partially explained by transaction costs and shows behavior consistent with investor under- and overreaction. Moreover, cross-sectional currency momentum has very different properties from the widely studied carry trade and is not highly correlated with returns of benchmark technical trading rules. However, there seem to be very effective limits to arbitrage that prevent momentum returns from being easily exploitable in currency markets.","['Lukas Menkhoff', 'Lucio Sarno', 'Maik Schmeling', 'Andreas Schrimpf']","['Momentum returns', 'Limits to arbitrage', 'Idiosyncratic volatility', 'Carry trades']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001353,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,3,Lukas Menkhoff,2012,169.29798886570848
Stock options and managerial incentives for risk taking: Evidence from FAS 123R,We provide new evidence on the relation between option-based compensation and risk-taking behavior by exploiting the change in the accounting treatment of stock options following the adoption of FAS 123R in 2005. The implementation of FAS 123R represents an exogenous change in the accounting benefits of stock options that has no effect on the economic costs and benefits of options for providing managerial incentives. Our results do not support the view that the convexity inherent in option-based compensation is used to reduce risk-related agency problems between managers and shareholders. We show that all firms dramatically reduce their usage of stock options (convexity) after the adoption of FAS 123R and that the decline in option use is strongly associated with a proxy for accounting costs. Little evidence exists that the decline in option usage following the accounting change results in less risky investment and financial policies.,"['Rachel M.

The advantage of the FDR over existing methods is that it selects more outperforming rules, which allows diversifying against model uncertainty. Persistence tests show that, even with the more powerful FDR technique, an investor would never have been able to select ex ante the future best-performing rules. Moreover, even in-sample, the performance is completely offset by the introduction of low transaction costs.

Political geography and stock returns: The value and risk implications of proximity to political power,"We show that political geography has a pervasive effect on the cross-section of stock returns. We collect election results over a 40-year period and use a political alignment index (PAI) of each state's leading politicians with the ruling (presidential) party to proxy for local firms’ proximity to political power. Firms whose headquarters are located in high PAI states outperform those located in low PAI states, both in terms of raw returns, and on a risk-adjusted basis. Overall, although we cannot rule out indirect political connectedness advantages as an explanation of the PAI effect, our results are consistent with the notion that proximity to political power has stock return implications because it reflects firms’ exposure to policy risk.","['Chansog (Francis) Kim', 'Christos Pantzalis', 'Jung Chul Park']","['Political geography', 'Political connections', 'Policy risk', 'Returns', 'Performance']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000785,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,1,Chansog (Francis) Kim,2012,169.29798886570848
Pinning in the S&P 500 futures,We show that Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 futures are pulled toward the at-the-money strike price on days when serial options on the S&P 500 futures expire (pinning) and are pushed away from the cost-of-carry adjusted at-the-money strike price right before the expiration of options on the S&P 500 index (anti-cross-pinning). These effects are driven by the interplay of market makers' rebalancing of delta hedges due to the time decay of those hedges as well as in response to reselling (and early exercise) of in-the-money options by individual investors.

Displacement risk and asset returns,"We study asset-pricing implications of innovation in a general-equilibrium overlapping-generations economy. Innovation increases the competitive pressure on existing firms and workers, reducing the profits of existing firms and eroding the human capital of older workers. Due to the lack of inter-generational risk sharing, innovation creates a systematic risk factor, which we call “displacement risk.” This risk helps explain several empirical patterns, including the existence of the growth-value factor in returns, the value premium, and the high equity premium. We assess the magnitude of displacement risk using estimates of inter-cohort consumption differences across households and find support for the model.","['Nicolae Gârleanu', 'Leonid Kogan', 'Stavros Panageas']","['Consumption-based asset pricing', 'Displacement risk', 'Value premium', 'Equity premium', 'Incomplete markets']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000621,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,3,Nicolae Gârleanu,2012,169.29798886570848

A quarterly tracking portfolio of stocks based on publicly observable hedge fund option holdings earns abnormal returns of 1.55% through the end of the quarter. Net of fees, hedge funds using options deliver higher benchmark-adjusted portfolio returns and lower risk than nonusers.

Consistent with endogenous liquidity provision by informed financial institutions, more liquidity is associated with obligors for which there is a greater information flow from the CDS market to the stock market ahead of major credit events.

Pricing of commercial real estate securities during the 2007–2009 financial crisis,"We study the relative and absolute pricing of CMBX contracts (commercial real estate derivatives) during the recent financial crisis. Using a structural CMBX pricing model, we find little systematic mispricing relative to REIT equity and options. We do find short-term deviations from this relative pricing relationship that are statistically and economically significant. In particular, the CMBX market temporarily overreacts to news announcements. We provide evidence that this temporary mispricing is caused by price pressure due to hedging activities. Finally, an absolute pricing analysis provides no substantial evidence that CMBX contracts traded at fire sale levels during the crisis.","['Joost Driessen', 'Otto Van Hemert']","['CMBX', 'REIT', 'Financial crisis', 'Commercial real estate', 'Capital structure arbitrage']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000244,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,1,Joost Driessen,2012,169.29798886570848
Reputation penalties for poor monitoring of executive pay: Evidence from option backdating,"We study whether outside directors are held accountable for poor monitoring of executive compensation by examining the reputation penalties to directors of firms involved in the option backdating (BD) scandal of 2006–2007. We find that, at firms involved in BD, significant penalties accrued to compensation committee members (particularly those who served during the BD period) both in terms of votes withheld when up for election and in terms of turnover, especially in more severe cases of BD. However, directors of BD firms did not suffer similar penalties at non-BD firms, raising the question of whether reputation penalties for poor oversight of executive pay are large enough to affect the ex ante incentives of directors.","['Yonca Ertimur', 'Fabrizio Ferri', 'David A.

Do arbitrageurs amplify economic shocks?,"We test the hypothesis that arbitrageurs amplify economic shocks in equity markets. The ability of speculators to hold short positions depends on asset values. Shorts are often reduced following good news about a stock. Therefore, the prices of highly shorted stocks are excessively sensitive to shocks compared with stocks with little short interest. We confirm this hypothesis using several empirical strategies including two quasi-experiments. In particular, we establish that the price of highly shorted stocks overshoots after good earnings news due to short covering compared with other stocks.","['Harrison Hong', 'Jeffrey D.

Predicting fraud by investment managers,"We test the predictability of investment fraud using a panel of mandatory disclosures filed with the SEC. We find that disclosures related to past regulatory and legal violations, conflicts of interest, and monitoring have significant power to predict fraud. Avoiding the 5% of firms with the highest ex ante predicted fraud risk would allow an investor to avoid 29% of fraud cases and over 40% of the total dollar losses from fraud. We find no evidence that investors receive compensation for fraud risk through superior performance or lower fees. We examine the barriers to implementing fraud prediction models and suggest changes to the SEC's data access policies that could benefit investors.","['Stephen G. Dimmock', 'William C.

Does it matter who pays for bond ratings? Historical evidence,"We test whether Standard and Poor's (S&P) assigns higher bond ratings after it switches from investor-pay to issuer-pay fees in 1974. Using Moody's rating for the same bond as a benchmark, we find that when S&P charges investors and Moody's charges issuers, S&P's ratings are lower than Moody's. Once S&P adopts issuer-pay, its ratings increase and no longer differ from Moody's. More importantly, S&P only assigns higher ratings for bonds that are subject to greater conflicts of interest, measured by higher expected rating fees or lower credit quality. These findings suggest that the issuer-pay model leads to higher ratings.","['John (Xuefeng) Jiang', 'Mary Harris Stanford', 'Yuan Xie']","['Credit ratings', 'Investor pay', 'Issuer pay', ""Moody's"", 'S&P']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1200061X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,3,John (Xuefeng) Jiang,2012,169.29798886570848
Hedging labor income risk,"We use a detailed panel data set of Swedish households to investigate the relation between their labor income risk and financial investment decisions. In particular, we relate changes in wage volatility to changes in the portfolio holdings for households that switched industries between 1999 and 2002. We find that households do adjust their portfolio holdings when switching jobs, which is consistent with the idea that households hedge their human capital risk in the stock market. The results are statistically and economically significant. A household going from an industry with low wage volatility to one with high volatility ceteris paribus decreases its portfolio share of risky assets by up to 35%, or $15,575.","['Sebastien Betermier', 'Thomas Jansson', 'Christine Parlour', 'Johan Walden']","['Investment decisions', 'Hedging', 'Human capital']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000724,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,3,Sebastien Betermier,2012,169.29798886570848
Endogeneity and the dynamics of internal corporate governance,"We use a well-developed dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator to alleviate endogeneity concerns in two aspects of corporate governance research: the effect of board structure on firm performance and the determinants of board structure. The estimator incorporates the dynamic nature of internal governance choices to provide valid and powerful instruments that address unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity. We re-examine the relation between board structure and performance using the GMM estimator in a panel of 6,000 firms over a period from 1991 to 2003, and find no causal relation between board structure and current firm performance. We illustrate why other commonly used estimators that ignore the dynamic relationship between current governance and past firm performance may be biased. We discuss where it may be appropriate to consider the dynamic panel GMM estimator in corporate governance research, as well as caveats to its use.","['M. Babajide Wintoki', 'James S.

The term structure of inflation expectations,"We use information in the term structure of survey-based forecasts of inflation to estimate a factor hidden in the nominal yield curve. We construct a model that accommodates forecasts over multiple horizons from multiple surveys and Treasury real and nominal yields by allowing for differences between risk-neutral, subjective, and objective probability measures. We establish that model-based inflation expectations are driven by inflation, output, and one latent factor. We find that this factor affects inflation expectations at all horizons but has almost no effect on the nominal yields; that is, the latent factor is hidden. We show that this hidden factor is not related to either current and past inflation or the standard set of macro variables studied in the literature. Consistent with the theoretical property of a hidden factor, our model outperforms a standard macro-finance model in its forecasting of inflation and yields.","['Mikhail Chernov', 'Philippe Mueller']","['Affine term structure models', 'Macro factors', 'Hidden factors', 'Survey forecasts']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12001195,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,106,2,Mikhail Chernov,2012,169.29798886570848
A darker side to decentralized banks: Market power and credit rationing in SME lending,"We use loan-level data to study how the organizational structure of banks impacts small business lending. We find that decentralized banks—where branch managers have greater autonomy over lending decisions—give larger loans to small firms and those with “soft information.” However, decentralized banks are also more responsive to their own competitive environment. They are more likely to expand credit when faced with competition but also cherry pick customers and restrict credit when they have market power. This “darker side” to decentralized banks in concentrated markets highlights that the level of local banking competition is key to determining which organizational structure provides better lending terms for small businesses.","['Rodrigo Canales', 'Ramana Nanda']","['Banking', 'Bank structure', 'Soft information', 'Small business lending']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X12000438,Journal of Financial Economics,0.5700853325799361,105,2,Rodrigo Canales,2012,169.29798886570848
Friends with money,"When banks and firms are connected through interpersonal linkages – such as their respective management having attended college or previously worked together – interest rates are markedly reduced, comparable with single shifts in credit ratings.

Are banks happy when managers go long? The information content of managers’ vested option holdings for loan pricing,"While traditional finance theory holds that managers with option-laden incentive contracts may favor equity at the expense of debt, a risk-averse manager may be more likely to retain vested in-the-money options if the manager has private information that the firm's risk-adjusted performance will be better. It follows that vested option holdings should be positively associated with credit quality. In support of this, we find that vested option holdings have a strong negative association with loan pricing, especially for informationally sensitive loans, and also predict higher cash flows and credit ratings, a greater distance to default, and lower equity volatility.","['Cristian L.

Performance maximization of actively managed funds,"A growing literature suggests that, even in the absence of any ability to predict returns, holding options on the benchmarks or trading frequently can generate positive alpha. The ratio of alpha to its tracking error appraises a fund's performance. This paper derives the performance-maximizing strategy, which turns out to be a variant of a buy-write strategy, and the least upper bound on such performance enhancement. If common equity indices are used as benchmarks, the potential alpha generated from trading frequently can be substantial in magnitude, but it carries considerable risk. The statistical significance in estimated alpha is low, and the probability of a negative alpha is high. The performance enhancement from holding options can be significant – both economically and statistically – if the options' implied volatilities are higher than the volatilities of the benchmark returns. The performance-maximizing strategy derived in this paper is different from the strategies that switch portfolio exposure to the benchmarks. The exposure-switching strategies are not promising unless the switching is based on superior information.","['Paolo Guasoni', 'Gur Huberman', 'Zhenyu Wang']","['Fund performance', 'Alpha', 'Sharpe ratio', 'Appraisal ratio', 'Buy-write']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000808,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,3,Paolo Guasoni,2011,169.21384473605355
Accelerated share repurchases,"Accelerated share repurchases (ASRs) are credible commitments by firms to repurchase shares immediately. Including an ASR in a repurchase program reduces the flexibility that firms have to alter an announced program in response to subsequent changes in the price and liquidity of its shares, unexpected shocks to cash flow and/or investment, etc. Thus, we investigate whether firms' decisions to include ASRs in their repurchase programs are associated with factors expected to influence the costs of lost flexibility and the benefits of enhanced credibility and immediacy. We find robust evidence consistent with the costs of lost flexibility and the benefits of credibility and immediacy being important determinants of ASR adoption. Additionally, we find that ASR announcements are associated with positive average abnormal stock returns.","['Leonce Bargeron', 'Manoj Kulchania', 'Shawn Thomas']","['Payout policy', 'Accelerated share repurchase', 'Liquidity']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000377,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,1,Leonce Bargeron,2011,169.21384473605355
Institutional demand pressure and the cost of corporate loans,"Between 2001 and 2007, annual institutional funding in highly leveraged loans went up from $32 billion to $426 billion, accounting for nearly 70% of the jump in total syndicated loan issuance over the same period. Did the inflow of institutional funding in the syndicated loan market lead to mispricing of credit? To understand this relation, we look at the institutional demand pressure defined as the number of days a loan remains in syndication. Using market-level and cross-sectional variation in time-on-the-market, we find that a shorter syndication period is associated with a lower final interest rate. The relation is robust to the use of institutional fund flow as an instrument. Furthermore, we find significant price differences between institutional investors’ tranches and banks’ tranches of the same loans, even though they share the same underlying fundamentals. Increasing demand pressure causes the interest rate on institutional tranches to fall below the interest rate on bank tranches. Overall, a one-standard-deviation reduction in average time-on-the-market decreases the interest rate for institutional loans by over 30 basis points per annum. While this effect is significantly larger for loan tranches bought by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), it is not fully explained by their role.","['Victoria Ivashina', 'Zheng Sun']","['Institutional investors', 'Syndicated loans', 'LBO', 'Credit crisis']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1000245X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,3,Victoria Ivashina,2011,169.21384473605355
"Corporate financing decisions, managerial market timing, and real investment","Both market timing and investment-based theories of corporate financing predict under-performance after firms raise capital, but only market timing predicts that the composition of financing (equity compared with debt) should also forecast returns. In cross-sectional tests, we find that the amount of net financing is more important than its composition in explaining future stock returns. In the time series, investment-based factor models explain abnormal stock performance following a variety of corporate financing events that previous studies link to market timing. At the aggregate level, the amount of new financing is also more important for future market returns than its composition. Overall, our joint tests reveal that measures of real investment are correlated with future returns and measures of managerial market timing are not.","['Alexander W.

"Media ownership, concentration and corruption in bank lending","Building on the pioneering study by Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2006), this study examines the effects of media ownership and concentration on corruption in bank lending using a unique World Bank data set covering more than 5,000 firms across 59 countries. We find strong evidence that state ownership of media is associated with higher levels of bank corruption. We also find that media concentration increases corruption both directly and indirectly through its interaction with media state ownership. In addition, we find that media state ownership and media concentration both accentuate the positive link between official supervisory power and lending corruption and attenuate the negative link between the regulations that empower private monitoring and corruption in lending. Media state ownership or media concentration also accentuates the positive link between banking concentration and corruption in lending. Furthermore, the links between media structure and corruption are more pronounced when the borrowing firm is privately owned.","['Joel F.

Tests of ex ante versus ex post theories of collateral using private and public information,"Collateral is a widely used, but not well understood, debt contracting feature. Two broad strands of theoretical literature explain collateral as arising from the existence of either ex ante private information or ex post incentive problems between borrowers and lenders. However, the extant empirical literature has been unable to isolate each of these effects. This paper attempts to do so using a credit registry that is unique in that it allows the researcher to have access to some private information about borrower risk that is unobserved by the lender. The data also include public information about borrower risk, loan contract terms, and ex post performance for both secured and unsecured loans. The results suggest that the ex post theories of collateral are empirically dominant, although the ex ante theories are also valid for customers with short borrower–lender relations that are relatively unknown to the lender.","['Allen N.

Are all CEOs above average? An empirical analysis of compensation peer groups and pay design,"Companies can potentially use compensation peer groups to inflate pay by choosing peers that are larger, choosing a high target pay percentile, or choosing peer firms with high pay. Although peers are largely selected based on characteristics that reflect the labor market for managerial talent, we find that peer groups are constructed in a manner that biases compensation upward, particularly in firms outside the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500. Pay increases close only about one-third of the gap between the pay of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the peer group, however, suggesting that boards exercise discretion in adjusting compensation. Preliminary evidence suggests that increased disclosure has reduced the biases in peer group choice.","['John Bizjak', 'Michael Lemmon', 'Thanh Nguyen']","['Executive compensation', 'Benchmarking', 'Peer groups', 'CEO pay']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000407,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,3,John Bizjak,2011,169.21384473605355
Institutional cross-holdings and their effect on acquisition decisions,"Cross-holdings are created when a shareholder of one firm holds shares in other firms as well, and cross-holdings alter shareholder preferences over corporate decisions that affect those other firms. Prior evidence suggests that such cross-holdings explain the puzzle of why shareholders allow acquisitions that reduce the value of the bidder. Conducting a shareholder-level analysis of cross-holdings, we instead find that cross-holdings are too small to matter in most acquisitions and that bidders do not bid more aggressively even in the few cases in which cross-holdings are large. We conclude that cross-holdings do not explain value-reducing acquisitions. Beyond acquisitions, we find that institutional cross-holdings between large firms have, in fact, increased rapidly over the last 20 years, but mostly due to indexing and quasi-indexing. As in acquisitions, cross-holdings by active investors are typically too small to matter.","['Jarrad Harford', 'Dirk Jenter', 'Kai Li']","['Cross-holdings', 'Institutional investors', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Shareholder preferences', 'Value-reducing acquisitions']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001844,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,1,Jarrad Harford,2011,169.21384473605355

The fragile capital structure of hedge funds and the limits to arbitrage,"During a financial crisis, when investors are most in need of liquidity and accurate prices, hedge funds cut their arbitrage positions and hoard cash. The paper explains this phenomenon. We argue that the fragile nature of the capital structure of hedge funds, combined with low market liquidity, creates a risk of coordination in redemptions among hedge fund investors that severely limits hedge funds' arbitrage capabilities. We present a model of hedge funds' optimal asset allocation in the presence of coordination risk among investors. We show that hedge fund managers behave conservatively and even abstain from participating in the market once coordination risk is factored into their investment decisions. The model suggests a new source of limits to arbitrage.","['Xuewen Liu', 'Antonio S.

Dividend distributions and closed-end fund discounts,"Empirical support for the hypothesis that closed-end fund discounts are related to overhanging tax liabilities has been mixed. We introduce a new approach to testing this hypothesis by examining changes in discount levels following distributions of dividends and capital gains. Since distributions reduce future shareholder tax liabilities, the tax liability hypothesis implies that closed-end fund discounts should decline following distributions. Focusing on changes in discounts isolates this tax effect by eliminating the impact of other fund-specific factors on discount levels. Our results support the tax liability hypothesis, showing that short-run fluctuations in discounts are directly affected by taxable distributions.","['Theodore E. Day', 'George Z.

Information asymmetry and self-selection bias in bank loan announcement studies,"Event-study driven research has produced a consensus that loans are unique relative to other financial contracts. But these studies assume that small samples of loan announcements adequately represent the loan population. We find that loan announcements are rare and driven by factors such as information asymmetry and perceived materiality. We show that the sample used by Billett, Flannery, and Garfinkel (1995) fails to represent the loan universe and that significant abnormal announcement returns are confined to their smallest firms. Our sample, which better represents the loan population, produces an abnormal return insignificantly different from zero. The findings suggest that self-selection bias affects extant loan announcement research and do not support the views that loans are a special form of finance or that private and public debt differ in significant ways. Were all loans to be announced, the average abnormal return would likely be insignificant.","['Pankaj K. Maskara', 'Donald J.

Capital structure dynamics and transitory debt,"Firms deliberately but temporarily deviate from permanent leverage targets by issuing transitory debt to fund investment. Leverage targets conservatively embed the option to issue transitory debt, with the evolution of leverage reflecting the sequence of investment outlays. We estimate a dynamic capital structure model with these features and find that it replicates industry leverage very well, explains debt issuances/repayments better than extant tradeoff models, and accounts for the leverage changes accompanying investment “spikes.” It generates leverage ratios with slow average speeds of adjustment to target, which are dampened by intentional temporary movements away from target, not debt issuance costs.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Toni M.

Share issuance and cash savings,"Firms increasingly issue shares for the purpose of cash savings. During the 1970s, $1.00 of issuance resulted in $0.23 of cash savings; over the most recent decade, $1.00 of issuance resulted in $0.60 of cash savings. This increase is caused by increasing precautionary motives. Proxies for precautionary motives increase over the sample period, and firm-level increases in these proxies are associated with firm-level increases in share issuance–cash savings. Share issuance–cash savings are inversely related to issuance costs, suggesting that firms issue and save when costs are low, so as to avoid issuing when costs are high.

Horizontal acquisitions and buying power: A product market analysis,"Horizontal mergers exert price pressure on dependent suppliers and adversely affect their performance. Consistent with the theory of countervailing power, concentrated suppliers and those with greater barriers to entry experience larger price declines after consolidation downstream. Time-series results suggest that consolidation in dependent supplier industries follows mergers in main customer industries, indicating that consolidation activity travels up the supply chain. The findings are broadly consistent with pervasive beliefs in the business community about the buying power effects of horizontal mergers.","['Sugato Bhattacharyya', 'Amrita Nain']","['Takeovers', 'Mergers', 'Buying power']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001832,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,1,Sugato Bhattacharyya,2011,169.21384473605355
Firm life expectancy and the heterogeneity of the book-to-market effect,"I argue that the reason the book-to-market effect is stronger in small stocks is because smaller stocks generally have shorter life expectancy and therefore shorter equity duration. I build a model in which the book-to-market effect is stronger in stocks with shorter life expectancy. Empirically, I use delisting probability as my proxy for life expectancy. The data support my model's central prediction and its additional implications for stock return and variance.

Research for sale: Determinants and consequences of paid-for analyst research,"I examine the determinants and market impact of paid-for coverage using a hand-collected sample of paid-for reports over 1999–2006. More than five hundred publicly listed US companies paid for analyst coverage since 1999. Yet little is known about the informational consequences of this analyst research. Firms with greater uncertainty, weaker information environments, and low turnover are more likely to buy coverage as they have the most to gain from analyst coverage but are unlikely to attract sell-side analysts. Despite the inherent conflicts of interest, I find paid-for reports have information content for investors based on 2-day abnormal returns. After the initiation of coverage, companies experience an increase in institutional ownership, sell-side analyst following, and liquidity.

Equity grants to target CEOs during deal negotiations,"I investigate the determinants and consequences of granting equity to the target's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) during deal negotiations. These negotiation grants likely reflect information about the acquisition, benefit from the deal premium, and provide more timely bargaining incentives. I find that CEOs are more likely to receive equity during negotiations when they negotiate for the target, particularly when the target has more bargaining power. This suggests that boards use equity to enhance bargaining incentives for CEOs with the most influence over deal price.

Why mutual funds “underperform”,"I propose a parsimonious model that reproduces the negative risk-adjusted performance of actively managed equity mutual funds. In the model, a fund manager can generate state-dependent active returns at a disutility. Negative expected performance and mutual fund investing simultaneously arise in equilibrium because the active return the fund manager generates covaries positively with a component of the pricing kernel that the performance measure omits, consistent with recent empirical evidence. Using data on U.S. funds, I also document new empirical evidence consistent with the model's cross-sectional implications.",['Vincent Glode'],"['Mutual fund', 'Performance', 'Business cycle', 'Investment', 'Pricing kernel']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002448,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,3,Vincent Glode,2011,169.21384473605355
Information aggregation around macroeconomic announcements: Revisions matter,"I show that an empirical relation exists between stock returns on macroeconomic news announcement days and the future revisions of the released data but that this link differs across the business cycle. Using three major macroeconomic series that undergo significant revisions (nonfarm payroll, gross domestic product, and industrial production), I present evidence that daily returns on the Standard & Poor's 500 index and revisions are positively related in expansions and negatively related in recessions. The results suggest that revisions do matter, i.e., that investors care about the final revised value of a macroeconomic series, that they infer accurate information from the release of the preliminary inaccurate report, and that the more precise information is aggregated into prices on the day of the initial announcement. The results are consistent with the predictions of rational expectations trading models around public announcements combined with well-established empirical results on the asymmetric interpretation of information across the business cycle.",['Thomas Gilbert'],"['Macroeconomic announcements', 'Revisions', 'Information precision', 'Price discovery']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000468,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,1,Thomas Gilbert,2011,169.21384473605355

Nonresident and tax-exempt (pension plan) investors cannot use the tax credit on corporate dividends and thus prefer to invest in flow-through entities.

"Jump risk, stock returns, and slope of implied volatility smile","In the presence of jump risk, expected stock return is a function of the average jump size, which can be proxied by the slope of option implied volatility smile. This implies a negative predictive relation between the slope of implied volatility smile and stock return. For more than four thousand stocks ranked by slope during 1996–2005, the difference between the risk-adjusted average returns of the lowest and highest quintile portfolios is 1.9% per month. Although both the systematic and idiosyncratic components of slope are priced, the idiosyncratic component dominates the systematic component in explaining the return predictability of slope. The findings are robust after controlling for stock characteristics such as size, book-to-market, leverage, volatility, skewness, and volume.

Liquidity risk management and credit supply in the financial crisis,"Liquidity dried up during the financial crisis of 2007–2009. Banks that relied more heavily on core deposit and equity capital financing, which are stable sources of financing, continued to lend relative to other banks. Banks that held more illiquid assets on their balance sheets, in contrast, increased asset liquidity and reduced lending. Off-balance sheet liquidity risk materialized on the balance sheet and constrained new credit origination as increased takedown demand displaced lending capacity. We conclude that efforts to manage the liquidity crisis by banks led to a decline in credit supply.","['Marcia Millon Cornett', 'Jamie John McNutt', 'Philip E.

Portfolio-level analyses and firm-level cross-sectional regressions indicate a negative and significant relation between the maximum daily return over the past one month (MAX) and expected stock returns. Average raw and risk-adjusted return differences between stocks in the lowest and highest MAX deciles exceed 1% per month. These results are robust to controls for size, book-to-market, momentum, short-term reversals, liquidity, and skewness.

Institutional stock trading on loan market information,"One of the most important developments in the corporate loan market over the past decade has been the growing participation of institutional investors. As lenders, institutional investors routinely receive private information about borrowers. However, most of these investors also trade in public securities. This leads to a controversial question: Do institutional investors use private information acquired in the loan market to trade in public securities? This paper examines the stock trading of institutional investors whose portfolios also hold loans. Using the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of loan amendments, we identify institutional investors with access to private information disclosed during loan amendments. We then look at abnormal returns on subsequent stock trades. We find that institutional participants in loan renegotiations subsequently trade in the stock of the same company and outperform trades by other managers and trades in other stocks by approximately 5.4% in annualized terms.","['Victoria Ivashina', 'Zheng Sun']","['Institutional investors', 'Syndicated loans', 'Insider trading']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002783,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,2,Victoria Ivashina,2011,169.21384473605355
Why do convertible issuers simultaneously repurchase stock? An arbitrage-based explanation,"Over recent years, a substantial fraction of US convertible bond issues have been combined with a stock repurchase. This paper explores the motivations for these combined transactions. We argue that convertible debt issuers repurchase their stock to facilitate arbitrage-related short selling. In line with this prediction, we show that convertibles combined with a stock repurchase are associated with lower offering discounts, lower stock price pressure, higher expected hedging demand, and lower issue-date short selling than uncombined issues. We also find that convertible arbitrage strategies explain both the size and the speed of execution of the stock repurchases.","['Abe de Jong', 'Marie Dutordoir', 'Patrick Verwijmeren']","['Convertible debt', 'Convertible arbitrage', 'Short selling', 'Stock repurchase']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002527,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,1,Abe de Jong,2011,169.21384473605355
Frequent issuers’ influence on long-run post-issuance returns,"Prior studies conclude that firms’ equity underperforms following many individual sorts of external financing.

Initial financing events do not associate with underperformance; however, subsequent financings do. Our results suggest that negative post-issuance returns have nothing to do with the specific type of security issued, and everything to do with the number of types of securities issued.","['Matthew T.

We explain these events within a general equilibrium framework in which expected endowment growth and economic uncertainty are subject to rare jumps. The arrival of a jump triggers the updating of agents' beliefs about the likelihood of future jumps, which produces a market crash and a permanent shift in option prices. Consumption and dividends remain smooth, and the model is consistent with salient features of individual stock options, equity returns, and interest rates.","['Luca Benzoni', 'Pierre Collin-Dufresne', 'Robert S.

How did increased competition affect credit ratings?,"The credit rating industry has historically been dominated by just two agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, leading to long-standing legislative and regulatory calls for increased competition. The material entry of a third rating agency (Fitch) to the competitive landscape offers a unique experiment to empirically examine how increased competition affects the credit ratings market. What we find is relatively troubling. Specifically, we discover that increased competition from Fitch coincides with lower quality ratings from the incumbents: Rating levels went up, the correlation between ratings and market-implied yields fell, and the ability of ratings to predict default deteriorated. We offer several possible explanations for these findings that are linked to existing theories.","['Bo Becker', 'Todd Milbourn']","['Credit ratings', 'Competition and reputation', 'Information quality']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000778,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,3,Bo Becker,2011,169.21384473605355
Markowitz meets Talmud: A combination of sophisticated and naive diversification strategies,"The modern portfolio theory pioneered by Markowitz (1952) is widely used in practice and extensively taught to MBAs. However, the estimated Markowitz portfolio rule and most of its extensions not only underperform the naive 1/N rule (that invests equally across N assets) in simulations, but also lose money on a risk-adjusted basis in many real data sets. In this paper, we propose an optimal combination of the naive 1/N rule with one of the four sophisticated strategies—the Markowitz rule, the Jorion (1986) rule, the MacKinlay and Pástor (2000) rule, and the Kan and Zhou (2007) rule—as a way to improve performance. We find that the combined rules not only have a significant impact in improving the sophisticated strategies, but also outperform the 1/N rule in most scenarios. Since the combinations are theory-based, our study may be interpreted as reaffirming the usefulness of the Markowitz theory in practice.","['Jun Tu', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Portfolio choice', 'Mean–variance analysis', 'Parameter uncertainty']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001893,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,1,Jun Tu,2011,169.21384473605355

Under reasonable assumptions about the underlying stocks' expected returns, the mean expected return estimate on the structured products is slightly below zero. The products do not provide tax, liquidity, or other benefits, and it is difficult to rationalize their purchase by informed rational investors.

Short-term termination without deterring long-term investment: A theory of debt and buyouts,"The option to terminate a manager early minimizes investor losses if he is unskilled. However, it also deters a skilled manager from undertaking efficient long-term projects that risk low short-term earnings. This paper demonstrates how risky debt can overcome this tension. Leverage concentrates equityholders' stakes, inducing them to learn the cause of low earnings. If they result from investment (poor management), the firm is continued (liquidated). Therefore, unskilled managers are terminated and skilled managers invest without fear of termination. Unlike models of managerial discipline based on total payout, dividends are not a substitute for debt—they allow for termination upon non-payment, but at the expense of investment since they do not concentrate ownership and induce monitoring. Debt is dynamically consistent as the manager benefits from monitoring. In traditional theories, monitoring constrains the manager; here, it frees him to invest.",['Alex Edmans'],"['Termination', 'Liquidation', 'Managerial myopia', 'Leverage', 'Private equity']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001437,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,1,Alex Edmans,2011,169.21384473605355
Diversification disasters,"The recent financial crisis has revealed significant externalities and systemic risks that arise from the interconnectedness of financial intermediaries’ risk portfolios. We develop a model in which the negative externality arises because intermediaries’ actions to diversify that are optimal for individual intermediaries may prove to be suboptimal for society. We show that the externality depends critically on the distributional properties of the risks. The optimal social outcome involves less risk-sharing, but also a lower probability for massive collapses of intermediaries. We derive the exact conditions under which risk-sharing restrictions create a socially preferable outcome.

Institutions also show little tendency to bet on any of the main characteristics known to predict stock returns, such as book-to-market, momentum, or accruals. While particular groups of institutions have modest stock-picking skill relative to the CAPM, their performance is almost entirely explained by the book-to-market and momentum effects in returns.

"Higher risk, lower returns: What hedge fund investors really earn","The returns of hedge fund investors depend not only on the returns of the funds they hold but also on the timing and magnitude of their capital flows in and out of these funds. We use dollar-weighted returns (a form of Internal Rate of Return (IRR)) to assess the properties of actual investor returns on hedge funds and compare them to buy-and-hold fund returns. Our main finding is that annualized dollar-weighted returns are on the magnitude of 3% to 7% lower than corresponding buy-and-hold fund returns. Using factor models of risk and the estimated dollar-weighted performance gap, we find that the real alpha of hedge fund investors is close to zero. In absolute terms, dollar-weighted returns are reliably lower than the return on the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 index, and are only marginally higher than the risk-free rate as of the end of 2008.

Ownership structure and financial constraints: Evidence from a structural estimation,"This article examines the impact of the divergence between corporate insiders' control rights and cash-flow rights on firms' external finance constraints via generalized method of moments estimation of an investment Euler equation. Using a large sample of U.S. firms during the 1994–2002 period, we find that the shadow value of external funds is significantly higher for companies with a wider insider control-ownership divergence, suggesting that companies whose corporate insiders have larger excess control rights are more financially constrained. The effect of insider excess control rights on external finance constraints is more pronounced for firms with higher degrees of informational opacity and for firms with financial misreporting, and is moderated by institutional ownership. The results show that the agency problems associated with the control-ownership divergence can have a real impact on corporate financial and investment outcomes.","['Chen Lin', 'Yue Ma', 'Yuhai Xuan']","['Ownership structure', 'Insider excess control rights', 'Financial constraints']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001395,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,2,Chen Lin,2011,169.21384473605355

Our results suggest that potential tunneling and other moral hazard activities by large shareholders are facilitated by their excess control rights.

The contract parameters, the extent of delegation, and equilibrium prices are all determined endogenously within the model we consider. Symmetric (fulcrum) performance fees distort the allocation of managed portfolios in a way that induces a significant and unambiguous positive effect on the prices of the assets included in the benchmark and a negative effect on the Sharpe ratios. Asymmetric performance fees have more complex effects on equilibrium prices and Sharpe ratios, with the signs of these effects fluctuating stochastically over time in response to variations in the funds' excess performance.","['Domenico Cuoco', 'Ron Kaniel']","['Asset pricing', 'Delegation', 'Agency', 'Money management', 'General equilibrium']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000456,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,2,Domenico Cuoco,2011,169.21384473605355
Does the stock market fully value intangibles? Employee satisfaction and equity prices,"This paper analyzes the relationship between employee satisfaction and long-run stock returns. A value-weighted portfolio of the “100 Best Companies to Work For in America” earned an annual four-factor alpha of 3.5% from 1984 to 2009, and 2.1% above industry benchmarks. The results are robust to controls for firm characteristics, different weighting methodologies, and the removal of outliers. The Best Companies also exhibited significantly more positive earnings surprises and announcement returns. These findings have three main implications.

The world price of liquidity risk,"This paper empirically tests the liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) on a global level. Consistent with the model, I find evidence that liquidity risks are priced independently of market risk in international financial markets. That is, a security’s required rate of return depends on the covariance of its own liquidity with aggregate local market liquidity, as well as the covariance of its own liquidity with local and global market returns. I also show that the US market is an important driving force of global liquidity risk. Furthermore, I find that the pricing of liquidity risk varies across countries according to geographic, economic, and political environments. The findings show that the systematic dimension of liquidity provides implications for international portfolio diversification.",['Kuan-Hui Lee'],"['Asset pricing', 'International finance', 'Liquidity', 'Liquidity risk', 'Liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model', 'Commonality in liquidity', 'Market integration', 'Market segmentation', 'Mildly segmented market', 'Zero return', 'Emerging market', 'Developed market']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001790,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,1,Kuan-Hui Lee,2011,169.21384473605355
Institutional tax clienteles and payout policy,"This paper employs heterogeneity in institutional shareholder tax characteristics to identify the relation between firm payout policy and tax incentives. Analysis of a panel of firms matched with the tax characteristics of the clients of their institutional shareholders indicates that “dividend-averse” institutions are significantly less likely to hold shares in firms with larger dividend payouts. This relation between the tax preferences of institutional shareholders and firm payout policy may reflect dividend-averse institutions gravitating towards low dividend paying firms or managers adapting their payout policies to the interests of their institutional shareholders. Evidence is provided that both effects are operative. Plausibly exogenous changes in payout policy result in shifting institutional ownership patterns. Similarly, exogenous changes in the tax cost of institutional investors receiving dividends results in changes in firm dividend policy.","['Mihir A.

"Hedge funds, managerial skill, and macroeconomic variables","This paper evaluates hedge fund performance through portfolio strategies that incorporate predictability based on macroeconomic variables. Incorporating predictability substantially improves out-of-sample performance for the entire universe of hedge funds as well as for various investment styles. While we also allow for predictability in fund risk loadings and benchmark returns, the major source of investment profitability is predictability in managerial skills. In particular, long-only strategies that incorporate predictability in managerial skills outperform their Fung and Hsieh (2004) benchmarks by over 17% per year. The economic value of predictability obtains for different rebalancing horizons and alternative benchmark models. It is also robust to adjustments for backfill bias, incubation bias, illiquidity, fund termination, and style composition.","['Doron Avramov', 'Robert Kosowski', 'Narayan Y.

The liquidity risk of liquid hedge funds,"This paper evaluates hedge funds that grant favorable redemption terms to investors. Within this group of purportedly liquid funds, high net inflow funds subsequently outperform low net inflow funds by 4.79% per year after adjusting for risk. The return impact of fund flows is stronger when funds embrace liquidity risk, when market liquidity is low, and when funding liquidity, as measured by the Treasury-Eurodollar spread, aggregate hedge fund flows, and prime broker stock returns, is tight. In keeping with an agency explanation, funds with strong incentives to raise capital, low manager option deltas, and no manager capital co-invested are more likely to take on excessive liquidity risk. These results resonate with the theory of funding liquidity by Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009).",['Melvyn Teo'],"['Hedge funds', 'Liquidity risk', 'Funding liquidity', 'Market liquidity', 'Redemption gates']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002771,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,1,Melvyn Teo,2011,169.21384473605355
Friends or foes? Target selection decisions of sovereign wealth funds and their consequences,"This paper examines investment strategies of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), their effect on target firm valuation, and how both of these are related to SWF transparency. We find that SWFs prefer large and poorly performing firms facing financial difficulties. Their investments have a positive effect on target firms' stock prices around the announcement date but no substantial effect on firm performance and governance in the long run. We also find that transparent SWFs are more likely to invest in financially constrained firms and have a greater impact on target firm value than opaque SWFs. Overall, SWFs are similar to passive institutional investors in their preference for target characteristics and in their effect on target performance, and SWF transparency influences SWFs' investment activities and their impact on target firm value.","['Jason Kotter', 'Ugur Lel']","['Sovereign wealth funds', 'Transparency', 'Cross-border investment', 'Firm value']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000729,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,2,Jason Kotter,2011,169.21384473605355
Global retail lending in the aftermath of the US financial crisis: Distinguishing between supply and demand effects,"This paper examines the broader effects of the US financial crisis on global lending to retail customers. In particular we examine retail bank lending in Germany using a unique data set of German savings banks during the period 2006 through 2008 for which we have the universe of loan applications and loans granted. Our experimental setting allows us to distinguish between savings banks affected by the US financial crisis through their holdings in Landesbanken with substantial subprime exposure and unaffected savings banks. The data enable us to distinguish between demand and supply side effects of bank lending and find that the US financial crisis induced a contraction in the supply of retail lending in Germany. While demand for loans goes down, it is not substantially different for the affected and nonaffected banks. More important, we find evidence of a significant supply side effect in that the affected banks reject substantially more loan applications than nonaffected banks. This result is particularly strong for smaller and more liquidity-constrained banks as well as for mortgage as compared with consumer loans. We also find that bank-depositor relationships help mitigate these supply side effects.","['Manju Puri', 'Jörg Rocholl', 'Sascha Steffen']","['Bank lending channel', 'Loan supply', 'Consumer lending', 'Credit rationing', 'Relationships']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002904,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,3,Manju Puri,2011,169.21384473605355
The causes and consequences of venture capital stage financing,"This paper examines the causes and consequences of venture capital (VC) stage financing. Using information about the physical location of an entrepreneurial firm and the geographic distance between the VC investor and the firm, I show that VC investors located farther away from an entrepreneurial firm tend to finance the firm using a larger number of financing rounds, shorter durations between successive rounds, and investing a smaller amount in each round. However, VC investors' propensity to stage is independent of whether the firm is located in a close-knit community. I also find that VC staging positively affects the entrepreneurial firm's propensity to go public, operating performance in the initial public offering (IPO) year, and post-IPO survival rate, but only if the firm is located far away from the VC investor. However, the effect of VC staging on entrepreneurial firm's performance is independent of whether it is located in a close-knit community. The findings are robust to a variety of alternative proximity measures, instrumental variables, and econometric approaches for dealing with endogeneity problems.",['Xuan Tian'],"['Stage financing', 'Venture capital', 'Monitoring', 'Hold-up', 'Learning']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000444,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,1,Xuan Tian,2011,169.21384473605355
Do hedge funds trade on private information? Evidence from syndicated lending and short-selling,"This paper investigates an important contemporary issue relating to the involvement of hedge funds in the syndicated loan market. In particular, we investigate the potential conflicts of interest that arise when hedge funds make syndicated loans and take short positions in the equity of borrowing firms. We find evidence consistent with the short-selling of the equity of the hedge fund borrowers prior to public announcements of both loan originations and loan amendments. We also find that hedge funds are more likely to lend to highly leveraged, lower credit quality firms, where access to private information is potentially the most valuable and where trading on such information could lead to enhanced profits. Overall, our results have important implications for the current debate regarding regulating the hedge fund industry.","['Nadia Massoud', 'Debarshi Nandy', 'Anthony Saunders', 'Keke Song']","['Hedge funds', 'Short-selling', 'Private information', 'Conflict of interest', 'Syndicated loans']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002382,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,3,Nadia Massoud,2011,169.21384473605355
Regulatory pressure and fire sales in the corporate bond market,"This paper investigates fire sales of downgraded corporate bonds induced by regulatory constraints imposed on insurance companies. As insurance companies hold over one-third of investment-grade corporate bonds, the collective need to divest downgraded issues may be limited by a scarcity of counterparties. Using insurance company transaction data, we find that insurance companies that are relatively more constrained by regulation are more likely to sell downgraded bonds. Bonds subject to a high probability of regulatory-induced selling exhibit price declines and subsequent reversals. These price effects appear larger during periods when the insurance industry is relatively distressed and other potential buyers' carpital is scarce.","['Andrew Ellul', 'Chotibhak Jotikasthira', 'Christian T.

Spot and forward volatility in foreign exchange,"This paper investigates the empirical relation between spot and forward implied volatility in foreign exchange. We formulate and test the forward volatility unbiasedness hypothesis, which may be viewed as the volatility analogue to the extensively researched hypothesis of unbiasedness in forward exchange rates. Using a new dataset of spot implied volatility quoted on over-the-counter currency options, we compute the forward implied volatility that corresponds to the delivery price of a forward contract on future spot implied volatility. This contract is known as a forward volatility agreement. We find strong evidence that forward implied volatility is a systematically biased predictor that overestimates movements in future spot implied volatility. This bias in forward volatility generates high economic value to an investor exploiting predictability in the returns to volatility speculation and indicates the presence of predictable volatility term premiums in foreign exchange.","['Pasquale Della Corte', 'Lucio Sarno', 'Ilias Tsiakas']","['Implied volatility', 'Foreign exchange', 'Forward volatility agreement', 'Unbiasedness', 'Volatility speculation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000316,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,3,Pasquale Della Corte,2011,169.21384473605355
The market reaction to corporate governance regulation,"This paper investigates the market reaction to recent legislative and regulatory actions pertaining to corporate governance. The managerial power view of governance suggests that executive pay, the existing process of proxy access, and various governance provisions [e.g., staggered boards and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)-chairman duality] are associated with managerial rent extraction. This perspective predicts that broad government actions that reduce executive pay, increase proxy access, and ban such governance provisions are value-enhancing. In contrast, another view of governance suggests that observed governance choices are the result of value-maximizing contracts between shareholders and management. This perspective predicts that broad government actions that regulate such governance choices are value destroying. Consistent with the latter view, we find that the abnormal returns to recent events relating to corporate governance regulations are, on average, decreasing in CEO pay, decreasing in the number of large blockholders, decreasing in the ease by which small institutional investors can access the proxy process, and decreasing in the presence of a staggered board.","['David F.

Improving the predictability of real economic activity and asset returns with forward variances inferred from option portfolios,"This paper presents an option positioning that allows us to infer forward variances from option portfolios. The forward variances we construct from equity index options help to predict (i) growth in measures of real economic activity, (ii) Treasury bill returns, (iii) stock market returns, and (iv) changes in variance swap rates.

The term structures of equity and interest rates,"This paper proposes a dynamic risk-based model capable of jointly explaining the term structure of interest rates, returns on the aggregate market, and the risk and return characteristics of value and growth stocks. Both the term structure of interest rates and returns on value and growth stocks convey information about how the representative investor values cash flows of different maturities. We model how the representative investor perceives risks of these cash flows by specifying a parsimonious stochastic discount factor for the economy. Shocks to dividend growth, the real interest rate, and expected inflation are priced, but shocks to the price of risk are not. Given reasonable assumptions for dividends and inflation, we show that the model can simultaneously account for the behavior of aggregate stock returns, an upward-sloping yield curve, the failure of the expectations hypothesis, and the poor performance of the capital asset pricing model.","['Martin Lettau', 'Jessica A.

General equilibrium pricing of options with habit formation and event risks,"This paper proposes a general equilibrium model that explains the pricing of the S&P 500 index options. The central ingredients are a peso component in the consumption growth rate and the time-varying risk aversion induced by habit formation which amplifies consumption shocks. The amplifying effect generates the excess volatility and a large jump-risk premium which combine to produce a pronounced volatility smirk for index options. The time-varying volatility and jump-risk premiums explain the observed state-dependent smirk patterns. Besides volatility smirks, the model has a variety of other implications which are broadly consistent with the aggregate stock and option market data.",['Du Du'],"['Habit formation', 'Economic disasters', 'Jump-risk premium', 'Volatility smirk']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002072,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,2,Du Du,2011,169.21384473605355
Disagreement and return predictability of stock portfolios,"This paper provides evidence that portfolio disagreement measured bottom-up from individual-stock analyst forecast dispersions has a number of asset pricing implications. For the market portfolio, market disagreement mean-reverts and is negatively related to ex post expected market return. Contemporaneously, an increase in market disagreement manifests as a drop in discount rate. For book-to-market sorted portfolios, the value premium is stronger among high disagreement stocks. The underperformance by high disagreement stocks is stronger among growth stocks. Growth stocks are more sensitive to variations in disagreement relative to value stocks. These findings are consistent with asset pricing theory incorporating belief dispersion.",['Jialin Yu'],"['Disagreement', 'Equity premium', 'Discount rate', 'Value premium']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001807,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,1,Jialin Yu,2011,169.21384473605355
Tracking down distress risk,"This paper shows that exposure to aggregate distress risk is the underlying source of the premiums for the Fama-French size (SMB) and value (HML) factors. Using a unique data set of aggregate business failures of both private and public firms from 1926 to 1997, I build portfolios that track news about future firm failures. These tracking portfolios optimally hedge aggregate distress risk and earn a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) alpha of approximately −4% a year. Both HML and SMB predict changes in future failure rates. Small stocks have lower returns than large stocks and value stocks have lower returns than growth stocks when the market expects an increase in future failure rates. Finally, a two-factor model with the market and the tracking portfolio for aggregate distress as factors does as well as the Fama-French three-factor model in pricing the 25 size and book-to-market sorted portfolios.",['Nishad Kapadia'],"['Distress risk', 'Bankruptcy', 'Risk factors']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001164,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,1,Nishad Kapadia,2011,169.21384473605355
"CEO ownership, external governance, and risk-taking","This paper shows the relation between CEO ownership and firm valuation hinges critically on the strength of external governance (EG). The relation is hump-shaped when EG is weak, but is insignificant when EG is strong. The results imply that CEO ownership and EG are substitutes for mitigating agency problems when ownership is low. However, very high levels of share ownership can reduce firm value by entrenching the CEO and discouraging him from taking risk, unless mitigated by strong EG. We identify channels through which CEO ownership affects firm value by examining R&D, which is discretionary and risky. We find CEO ownership similarly exhibits a hump-shaped relation with R&D when EG is weak, but no relation when EG is strong. Our results are robust to endogeneity issues concerning CEO ownership and EG.","['E.

A theory of corporate financial decisions with liquidity and solvency concerns,"This paper studies the impact of both liquidity and solvency concerns on corporate finance. I present a tractable model of a firm that optimally chooses capital structure, cash holdings, dividends, and default while facing cash flows with long-term uncertainty and short-term liquidity shocks. The model explains how changes in solvency affect liquidity and also how liquidity concerns affect solvency via capital structure choice. These interactions result in a dynamic cash policy in which cash reserves increase in profitability and are positively correlated with cash flows. The optimal dividend distributions implied by the model are smoothed relative to cash flows.

A model of dynamic compensation and capital structure,"This paper studies the optimal compensation problem between shareholders and the agent in the Leland (1994) capital structure model, and finds that the debt-overhang effect on the endogenous managerial incentives lowers the optimal leverage. Consistent with data, our model delivers a negative relation between pay-performance sensitivity and firm size, and the interaction between debt-overhang and agency issue leads smaller firms to take less leverage relative to their larger peers. During financial distress, a firm's cash flow becomes more sensitive to underlying performance shocks due to debt-overhang.

The positive relation between expected corporate bond returns and liquidity beta is robust to the effects of default and term betas, liquidity level, and other bond characteristics, as well as to different model specifications, test methodologies, and a variety of liquidity measures.

The role of securitization in bank liquidity and funding management,"This paper studies the role of securitization in bank management. I propose a new index of “bank loan portfolio liquidity” which can be thought of as a weighted average of the potential to securitize loans of a given type, where the weights reflect the composition of a bank loan portfolio. I use this new index to show that by allowing banks to convert illiquid loans into liquid funds, securitization reduces banks' holdings of liquid securities and increases their lending ability. Furthermore, securitization provides banks with an additional source of funding and makes bank lending less sensitive to cost of funds shocks. By extension, the securitization weakens the ability of the monetary authority to affect banks' lending activity but makes banks more susceptible to liquidity and funding crisis when the securitization market is shut down.",['Elena Loutskina'],"['Securitization', 'Bank management', 'Liquidity', 'Lending channel', 'Monetary policy']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000389,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,3,Elena Loutskina,2011,169.21384473605355
Ex post: The investment performance of collectible stamps,"This paper uses stamp catalogue prices to investigate the returns on British collectible postage stamps over the period 1900–2008. We find an annualized return on stamps of 7.0% in nominal terms, or 2.9% in real terms. These returns are higher than those on bonds but below those on equities. The volatility of stamp prices approaches that of equities. Stamp returns are impacted by movements in the equity market, but the systematic risk of stamps remains low. Stamps partially hedge against unanticipated inflation.

The impact of governance reform on performance and transparency,"This study examines the influence of Mexico’s efforts to improve corporate governance on firm performance and transparency. We utilize compliance data from the Code of ‘Best’ Corporate Practices, disclosed annually by public firms in Mexico, as a measure of corporate governance strength. We document a significant increase in compliance over 2000–2004 indicating Mexican companies view non-compliance as costly. However, we find no association between the governance index and firm performance, nor is there a relation with transparency. Instead, we find firms with greater compliance resort to the more costly mechanism of making dividend payments (higher propensity to pay and greater yield) to reduce agency conflicts. We conclude these associations are the direct result of the institutional features of the Mexican business environment, which is characterized by concentrated ownership of insiders, interlocked boards of directors, a lack of insider trading enforcement, and generally poor protection of minority investors. Our results show that monitoring mechanisms alone are not enough to fundamentally change economic behavior.","['Richard Price', 'Francisco J.

Deviation from the target capital structure and acquisition choices,"This study finds that managers take deviations from their target capital structures into account when planning and structuring acquisitions. Specifically, firms that are overleveraged relative to their target debt ratios are less likely to make acquisitions and are less likely to use cash in their offers. Furthermore, they acquire smaller targets and pay lower premiums. Managers of overleveraged firms also actively rebalance their capital structures when they anticipate a high likelihood of making an acquisition. Finally, they pursue the most value-enhancing acquisitions. Collectively, these findings improve understanding of how firms choose their capital structures and shed light on the interdependence of capital structure and investment decisions in the presence of financial frictions.",['Vahap B.

Egalitarianism and international investment,"This study identifies how country differences on a key cultural dimension—egalitarianism—influence international investment flows. A society's cultural orientation toward egalitarianism is manifested by intolerance for abuses of market and political power and a desire for protecting less powerful actors. We show egalitarianism to be based on exogenous factors including social fractionalization, dominant religion circa 1900, and war experience from the 19th century. We find a robust influence of egalitarianism distance on cross-national flows of bond and equity issuances, syndicated loans, and mergers and acquisitions. An informal cultural institution largely determined a century or more ago, egalitarianism exercises its effect on international investment via an associated set of consistent contemporary policy choices. But even after controlling for these associated policy choices, egalitarianism continues to exercise a direct effect on cross-border investment flows, likely through its direct influence on managers' daily business conduct.","['Jordan I.

We conjecture that gambling propensity would be stronger in regions with higher concentrations of Catholics relative to Protestants. Consistent with our conjecture, we show that in regions with higher Catholic–Protestant ratios, investors exhibit a stronger propensity to hold lottery-type stocks, broad-based employee stock option plans are more popular, the initial day return following an initial public offering is higher, and the magnitude of the negative lottery-stock premium is larger. Collectively, these results indicate that religion-induced gambling attitudes impact investors' portfolio choices, corporate decisions, and stock returns.","['Alok Kumar', 'Jeremy K.

Time-varying rare disaster risk and stock returns,"This study provides empirical support for theoretical models that allow for time-varying rare disaster risk. Using a database of 447 international political crises during the period 1918–2006, we create a crisis index that shows substantial variation over time. Changes in this crisis index, our proxy for changes in perceived disaster probability, have a large impact on both the mean and volatility of world stock market returns. Crisis risk is positively correlated with the earnings–price ratio and the dividend yield. Cross-sectional tests also show that crisis risk is priced: Industries that are more crisis risk sensitive yield higher returns.","['Henk Berkman', 'Ben Jacobsen', 'John B.

Investor sentiment and the mean–variance relation,"This study shows the influence of investor sentiment on the market's mean–variance tradeoff. We find that the stock market's expected excess return is positively related to the market's conditional variance in low-sentiment periods but unrelated to variance in high-sentiment periods. These findings are consistent with sentiment traders who, during the high-sentiment periods, undermine an otherwise positive mean–variance tradeoff. We also find that the negative correlation between returns and contemporaneous volatility innovations is much stronger in the low-sentiment periods. The latter result is consistent with the stronger positive ex ante relation during such periods.","['Jianfeng Yu', 'Yu Yuan']","['Investor sentiment', 'Mean-variance relation', 'Risk-return tradeoff', 'Volatility']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002473,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,2,Jianfeng Yu,2011,169.21384473605355
Technological change and the growing inequality in managerial compensation,"Three of the most fundamental changes in US corporations since the early 1970s have been (1) the increased importance of organizational capital in production, (2) the increase in managerial income inequality and pay-performance sensitivity, and (3) the secular decrease in labor market reallocation. Our paper develops a simple explanation for these changes: a shift in the composition of productivity growth away from vintage-specific to general growth. This shift has stimulated the accumulation of organizational capital in existing firms and reduced the need for reallocating workers to new firms. We characterize the optimal managerial compensation contract when firms accumulate organizational capital but risk-averse managers cannot commit to staying with the firm. A calibrated version of the model reproduces the increase in managerial compensation inequality and the increased sensitivity of pay to performance in the data over the last three decades. This increased sensitivity of compensation to performance provides large, successful firms with the glue to retain their managers and the organizational capital embedded in them.","['Hanno Lustig', 'Chad Syverson', 'Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh']","['Corporate payout policy', 'Organizational capital', 'Labor reallocation', 'Managerial compensation', 'Pay-for-performance sensitivity']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002199,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,3,Hanno Lustig,2011,169.21384473605355
"Conditional risk and performance evaluation: Volatility timing, overconditioning, and new estimates of momentum alphas","Unconditional alphas are biased when conditional beta covaries with the market risk premium (market timing) or volatility (volatility timing). We demonstrate an additional bias (overconditioning) that can occur any time an empiricist estimates risk using information, such as a realized beta, that is not available to investors ex ante. Calibrating to U.S. equity returns, volatility timing and overconditioning can plausibly impact alphas more than market timing, which has been the focus of prior literature. To correct market- and volatility-timing biases without overconditioning, we show that incorporating realized betas into instrumental variables estimators is effective. Empirically, instrumentation reduces momentum alphas by 20–40%. Overconditioned alphas overstate performance by up to 2.5 times. We explain the sources of both the volatility-timing and overconditioning biases in momentum portfolios.","['Oliver Boguth', 'Murray Carlson', 'Adlai Fisher', 'Mikhail Simutin']","['Performance evaluation', 'Conditional CAPM', 'Volatility timing', 'Momentum']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001413,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,2,Oliver Boguth,2011,169.21384473605355
Stock option grants to target CEOs during private merger negotiations,"Unscheduled stock options to target chief executive officers (CEOs) are a nontrivial phenomenon during private merger negotiations. In 920 acquisition bids during 1999–2007, over 13% of targets grant them. These options substitute for golden parachutes and compensate target CEOs for the benefits they forfeit because of the merger. Targets granting unscheduled options are more likely to be acquired but they earn lower premiums. Consequently, deal value drops by $62 for every dollar target CEOs receive from unscheduled options. Conversely, acquirers of targets offering these awards experience higher returns. Therefore, deals involving unscheduled grants exhibit a transfer of wealth from target shareholders to bidder shareholders.","['Eliezer M. Fich', 'Jie Cai', 'Anh L.

Growth LBOs,"Using a data set of 839 French deals, we look at the change in corporate behavior following a leveraged buyout (LBO) relative to an adequately chosen control group. In the 3 years following a leveraged buyout, targets become more profitable, grow much faster than their peer group, issue additional debt, and increase capital expenditures. We then provide evidence consistent with the idea that in our sample, private equity funds create value by relaxing credit constraints, allowing LBO targets to take advantage of hitherto unexploited growth opportunities. First, post-buyout growth is concentrated among private-to-private transactions, i.e., deals where the seller is an individual, as opposed to divisional buyouts or public-to-private LBOs where the seller is a private or a public firm. Second, the observed post-buyout growth in size and post-buyout increase in debt and capital expenditures are stronger when the targets operate in an industry that is relatively more dependent on external finance. These results contrast with existing evidence that LBO targets invest less or downsize.","['Quentin Boucly', 'David Sraer', 'David Thesmar']","['Leveraged buyout', 'Credit constraints', 'Private firms', 'Corporate growth']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001371,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,2,Quentin Boucly,2011,169.21384473605355
CFOs versus CEOs: Equity incentives and crashes,"Using a large sample of U.S. firms for the period 1993–2009, we provide evidence that the sensitivity of a chief financial officer's (CFO) option portfolio value to stock price is significantly and positively related to the firm's future stock price crash risk. In contrast, we find only weak evidence of the positive impact of chief executive officer option sensitivity on crash risk. Finally, we find that the link between CFO option sensitivity and crash risk is more pronounced for firms in non-competitive industries and those with a high level of financial leverage.","['Jeong-Bon Kim', 'Yinghua Li', 'Liandong Zhang']","['Equity incentives', 'Crash risk', 'Compensation', 'Corporate governance', 'CFO']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1100078X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,3,Jeong-Bon Kim,2011,169.21384473605355
Corporate tax avoidance and stock price crash risk: Firm-level analysis,"Using a large sample of U.S. firms for the period 1995–2008, we provide strong and robust evidence that corporate tax avoidance is positively associated with firm-specific stock price crash risk. This finding is consistent with the following view: Tax avoidance facilitates managerial rent extraction and bad news hoarding activities for extended periods by providing tools, masks, and justifications for these opportunistic behaviors. The hoarding and accumulation of bad news for extended periods lead to stock price crashes when the accumulated hidden bad news crosses a tipping point, and thus comes out all at once. Moreover, we show that the positive relation between tax avoidance and crash risk is attenuated when firms have strong external monitoring mechanisms such as high institutional ownership, high analyst coverage, and greater takeover threat from corporate control markets.","['Jeong-Bon Kim', 'Yinghua Li', 'Liandong Zhang']","['Tax avoidance', 'Crash risk', 'Agency theory', 'Governance', 'Extreme outcome']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1100033X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,3,Jeong-Bon Kim,2011,169.21384473605355
Vertical divestitures through equity carve-outs and spin-offs: A product markets perspective,"Using a product markets perspective to investigate the decision to vertically disintegrate, we find that vertical divestitures are more likely in response to positive industry demand shocks, favorable industry financing conditions, and lower parent firm relative productivity and are less likely when the potential for contracting problems is high. Conditional on vertical divestitures, equity carve-outs are more likely in environments in which relationship-specific investments are more prevalent and when the need for external funds is high, while spin-offs are more likely in larger industries and in industries that experience positive demand shocks. Our examinations of announcement-period wealth effects and changes in operating performance indicate that vertical divestitures are motivated by efficiency considerations.","['Bharat A.

What determines stock option contract design?,"We analyze the factors that drive exercise price policy for executive option plans (ESOPs) and their scope in a country where firms are not subject to the tax and accounting considerations that seem to have led to the dominance of at-the-money options in the US Our “unbounded” data for Finland provide us with an excellent opportunity to investigate whether contract design is consistent with compensation theory. Our findings are largely consistent with predictions from the optimal contracting literature. The size of the plan is negatively related to Tobin's Q and firm size and positively related to proxies for monitoring costs, which also influence the probability of launching premium ESOPs. Our results also show that the premium (out-of-the-moneyness) is negatively related to prior stock returns and cash flow-to-assets, which may be an indication of high-water mark contracting, or alternatively, of managerial power. Finally, we also find some support for a positive relation between the premium and the length of the vesting period when maturity is fixed, which indicates an effort to keep the incentives for management from falling over time.","['Eva Liljeblom', 'Daniel Pasternack', 'Matts Rosenberg']","['Stock option contract design', 'Optimal contracting', 'Agency cost']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001668,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,2,Eva Liljeblom,2011,169.21384473605355
"Breaking down the barriers: Competition, syndicate structure, and underwriting incentives","We argue that the entry of commercial banks into bond underwriting led to the evolution of co-led underwriting arrangements and lowered the screening incentives of underwriters. Lead underwriters in co-led syndicates faced weaker incentives to screen issuer quality. In boom markets, issues underwritten by co-led syndicates were more likely to be involved in financial misrepresentation events. Underwriter incentives in co-led syndicates were particularly weak in industries where commercial banks stole substantial market share. Similar patterns do not hold in bust markets where investors are likely to engage in their own information collection efforts. Our results suggest that competition may have an adverse effect on the incentives of financial intermediaries in market environments where their information production is more valuable to investors.","['Anil Shivdasani', 'Wei-Ling Song']","['Banking deregulation', 'Underwriting', 'Certification', 'Investment banking', 'Financial fraud']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002187,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,3,Anil Shivdasani,2011,169.21384473605355
Real investment and risk dynamics,"We ask to what extent the negative relation between investment and average stock returns is driven by risk.

"Asymmetric information, adverse selection, and the pricing of CMBS","We demonstrate that asymmetric information between sellers (loan originators) and purchasers (investors and securities issuers) of commercial mortgages gives rise to a standard lemons problem, whereby portfolio lenders use private information to liquidate lower quality loans in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) markets. Conduit lenders, who originate loans for direct sale into securitization markets, mitigate problems of asymmetric information and adverse selection in loan sales. Our theory provides an explanation for the pricing puzzle observed in CMBS markets, whereby conduit CMBS loans are priced higher than portfolio loans, despite widespread belief that conduit loans are originated at lower quality. Consistent with theoretical predictions of a lemons discount, our empirical analysis of 141 CMBS deals and 16,760 CMBS loans shows that, after controlling for observable determinants of loan pricing, conduit loans enjoyed a 34 basis points pricing advantage over portfolio loans in the CMBS market.","['Xudong An', 'Yongheng Deng', 'Stuart A.

Corporate investment and financing under asymmetric information,"We develop a dynamic model of corporate investment and financing decisions in which corporate insiders have superior information about the firm's growth prospects. We show that firms with positive private information can credibly signal their type to outside investors using the timing of corporate actions and their debt-equity mix. Using this result, we show that asymmetric information induces firms with good prospects to speed up investment, leading to a significant erosion of the option value of waiting to invest. Additionally, we demonstrate that informational asymmetries may not translate into a financing hierarchy or pecking order over securities. Finally, we generate a rich set of testable implications relating firms’ investment and financing strategies, abnormal announcement returns, and external financing costs to a number of managerial, firm, and industry characteristics.","['Erwan Morellec', 'Norman Schürhoff']","['Asymmetric information', 'Financing decisions', 'Endogenous financing constraints', 'Corporate investment', 'Real options']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002096,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,2,Erwan Morellec,2011,169.21384473605355
Adding and subtracting Black-Scholes: A new approach to approximating derivative prices in continuous-time models,"We develop a new approach to approximating asset prices in the context of continuous-time models. For any pricing model that lacks a closed-form solution, we provide a closed-form approximate solution, which relies on the expansion of the intractable model around an “auxiliary” one. We derive an expression for the difference between the true (but unknown) price and the auxiliary one, which we approximate in closed-form, and use to create increasingly improved refinements to the initial mispricing induced by the auxiliary model. The approach is intuitive, simple to implement, and leads to fast and extremely accurate approximations. We illustrate this method in a variety of contexts including option pricing with stochastic volatility, computation of Greeks, and the term structure of interest rates.","['Dennis Kristensen', 'Antonio Mele']","['Continuous-time models', 'Option pricing theory', 'Stochastic volatility', 'Closed-form approximations']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1100119X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,2,Dennis Kristensen,2011,169.21384473605355
"IPO waves, product market competition, and the going public decision: Theory and evidence","We develop a new rationale for initial public offering (IPO) waves based on product market considerations. Two firms, with differing productivity levels, compete in an industry with a significant probability of a positive productivity shock. Going public, though costly, not only allows a firm to raise external capital cheaply, but also enables it to grab market share from its private competitors. We solve for the decision of each firm to go public versus remain private, and the optimal timing of going public. In equilibrium, even firms with sufficient internal capital to fund their new investment may go public, driven by the possibility of their product market competitors going public. IPO waves may arise in equilibrium even in industries which do not experience a productivity shock. Our model predicts that firms going public during an IPO wave will have lower productivity and post-IPO profitability but larger cash holdings than those going public off the wave; it makes similar predictions for firms going public later versus earlier in an IPO wave. We empirically test and find support for these predictions.","['Thomas J.

Local underwriter oligopolies and IPO underpricing,"We develop a theory of initial public offering (IPO) underpricing based on differentiated underwriting services and localized competition. Even though a large number of investment banks compete for IPOs, if issuers care about non-price dimensions of underwriting, then the industry structure is best characterized as a series of local oligopolies. We test our model implications on all-star analyst coverage, industry expertise, and other non-price dimensions. Furthermore, we posit that venture capitalists (VCs) are especially focused on all-star analyst coverage, and develop the analyst lust theory of the underpricing of VC-backed IPOs. Consistent with this theory, we find that VC-backed IPOs are much more underpriced when they have coverage from an all-star analyst.","['Xiaoding Liu', 'Jay R.

A theory of equity carve-outs and negative stub values under heterogeneous beliefs,"We develop a theory of new-project financing and equity carve-outs under heterogeneous beliefs. In our model, an employee of a firm generates an idea for a new project that can be financed either by issuing equity against the cash flows of the entire firm (“integration”), or by undertaking an equity carve-out of the new project alone (“non-integration”). While the patent underlying the new project is owned by the firm, the employee generating the idea needs to be motivated to exert optimal effort for the project to be successful. The firm's choice between integration and non-integration is driven primarily by heterogeneity in beliefs among outside investors (each of whom has limited wealth to invest in the equity market) and between firm insiders and outsiders: if the marginal outsider financing the new project is more optimistic about the prospects of the project than firm insiders, and this incremental optimism of the marginal outsider over firm insiders is greater regarding new-project cash flows than that about assets-in-place cash flows, then the firm will implement the project under non-integration rather than integration. Two other ingredients driving the firm's financing choice are the cost of motivating the employee to exert optimal effort, and the potential synergies between the new project and assets in place. We derive a number of testable predictions regarding a firm's equilibrium choice between integration and non-integration. We also provide a rationale for the “negative stub values” documented in the equity carve-outs of certain firms (e.g., the carve-out of Palm from 3Com) and develop predictions for the magnitude of these stub values.","['Onur Bayar', 'Thomas J.

Board structure and price informativeness,"We develop and test the hypothesis that stock price informativeness affects the structure of corporate boards. We find a negative relation between price informativeness and board independence. This finding is robust to the inclusion of many firm-level controls, including firm fixed effects, and to the choice of the measure of price informativeness. Consistent with the hypothesis that price informativeness and board monitoring are substitutes, this relation is particularly strong for firms more exposed to both external and internal governance mechanisms and for firms in which firm-specific knowledge is relatively unimportant. Our results suggest that firms with more informative stock prices have less demanding board structures.","['Daniel Ferreira', 'Miguel A. Ferreira', 'Clara C.

We conduct cross-sectional regressions of returns on asset growth on subsamples split by a given measure of limits-to-arbitrage or investment frictions. We show that: (i) proxies for limits-to-arbitrage and proxies for investment frictions are often highly correlated; (ii) the evidence based on equal-weighted returns shows significant support for both hypotheses, while the evidence from value-weighted returns is weaker; and (iii) in direct comparisons, each hypothesis is supported by a fair and similar amount of evidence.","['F.Y.

Corporate governance when founders are directors,"We examine chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, CEO retention policies, and mergers and acquisition (M&A) decisions in firms in which founders serve as a director with a nonfounder CEO (founder-director firms). We find that founder-director firms offer a different mix of incentives to their CEOs than other firms. Pay-for-performance sensitivity for nonfounder CEOs in founder-director firms is higher and the level of pay is lower than that of other CEOs. CEO turnover sensitivity to firm performance is also significantly higher in founder-director firms compared with nonfounder firms. Overall, the evidence suggests that boards with founder-directors provide more high-powered incentives in the form of pay and retention policies than the average US board. Stock returns around M&A announcements and board attendance are also higher in founder-director firms compared with nonfounder firms.","['Feng Li', 'Suraj Srinivasan']","['CEO compensation', 'CEO turnover', 'Founder', 'Boards of Directors', 'Corporate governance']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001462,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,2,Feng Li,2011,169.21384473605355
Strategic IPOs and product market competition,"We examine firms' incentives to go public in the presence of product market competition. As a result of their greater ability to diversify idiosyncratic risk in the capital market, public firms' owners tolerate higher profit variability than owners of private firms. Consequently, public firms adopt riskier and more aggressive output market strategies than private firms, which improves the competitive position of the former vis-à-vis the latter. This strategic benefit of being public, and thus, the proportion of public firms in an industry, is shown to be positively related to the degree of competitive interaction among firms in the output market, to demand uncertainty, and to the idiosyncratic portion of this uncertainty. Additional empirical predictions concern the effect of a firm's initial public offering on its market share and on its rivals' valuations. We test the model's predictions and find empirical support for most of them.","['Jiri Chod', 'Evgeny Lyandres']","['IPO', 'Risk aversion', 'Product market competition', 'Demand uncertainty']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002461,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,1,Jiri Chod,2011,169.21384473605355
Post-merger restructuring and the boundaries of the firm,We examine how firms redraw their boundaries after acquisitions using plant-level data.

Acquirers of full firms sell 27% and close 19% of the plants of target firms within three years of the acquisition. Acquirers with skill in running their peripheral divisions tend to retain more acquired plants. Retained plants increase in productivity whereas sold plants do not.

We use newly available trade reporting facilities (TRFs) data to measure fragmentation, and we use a variety of empirical approaches to compare execution quality and efficiency of stocks with more and less fragmented trading. We find that fragmentation affects all stocks; more fragmented stocks have lower transactions costs and faster execution speeds; and fragmentation is associated with higher short-term volatility but greater market efficiency, in that prices are closer to being a random walk.

Behavioral biases of mutual fund investors,"We examine the effect of behavioral biases on the mutual fund choices of a large sample of US discount brokerage investors using new measures of attention to news, tax awareness, and fund-level familiarity bias, in addition to behavioral and demographic characteristics of earlier studies. Behaviorally biased investors typically make poor decisions about fund style and expenses, trading frequency, and timing, resulting in poor performance. Furthermore, trend chasing appears related to behavioral biases, rather than to rationally inferring managerial skill from past performance. Factor analysis suggests that biased investors often conform to stereotypes that can be characterized as Gambler, Smart, Overconfident, Narrow Framer, and Mature.","['Warren Bailey', 'Alok Kumar', 'David Ng']","['Individual investors', 'Mutual funds', 'Trend chasing', 'Behavioral biases', 'Factor analysis']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001140,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,1,Warren Bailey,2011,169.21384473605355
Corporate cash holdings and CEO compensation incentives,"We examine the effect of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation incentives on corporate cash holdings and the value of cash to better understand how compensation incentives designed to enhance the alignment of manager and shareholder interests could influence stockholder-bondholder conflicts. We find a positive relation between CEO risk-taking (vega) incentives and cash holdings, and we find a negative relation between vega and the value of cash to shareholders. The negative effect of vega on the value of cash is robust after controlling for corporate governance, is stronger in firms with high leverage, is reversed for unlevered firms, and is not present in financially constrained firms. We also find that the likelihood of liquidity covenants in new bank loans is increasing in CEO vega incentives. Our evidence primarily supports the costly contracting hypothesis, which asserts that bondholders anticipate greater risk-taking in high vega firms and, therefore, require greater liquidity.","['Yixin Liu', 'David C.

Directors' and officers' liability insurance and acquisition outcomes,We examine the effect of directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&O insurance) on the outcomes of merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. We find that acquirers whose executives have a higher level of D&O insurance coverage experience significantly lower announcement-period abnormal stock returns. Further analyses suggest that acquirers with a higher level of D&O insurance protection tend to pay higher acquisition premiums and their acquisitions appear to exhibit lower synergies. The evidence provides support for the notion that the provision of D&O insurance can induce unintended moral hazard by shielding directors and officers from the discipline of shareholder litigation.,"['Chen Lin', 'Micah S.

Competition among mutual funds,"We examine the impact of the entry of new mutual funds on incumbents using the overlap in their portfolio holdings as a measure of competitive intensity. This simple metric delivers powerful economic results. Incumbents that have a high overlap with entrants subsequently engage in price competition by reducing management fees. Distribution fees, however, rise so that investors do not benefit as much from price competition. Funds with high overlap also experience quantity competition through lower investor flows, have lower alphas, and higher attrition rates. These effects only appear after the late 1990s, at which point there appears to be an endogenous structural shift in the competitive environment. We conclude that the mutual fund market has evolved into one that displays the hallmark features of a competitive market.","['Sunil Wahal', 'Albert (Yan) Wang']","['Mutual Funds', 'Competitive market', 'Incumbents']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001881,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,1,Sunil Wahal,2011,169.21384473605355
Does governance travel around the world? Evidence from institutional investors,"We examine whether institutional investors affect corporate governance by analyzing portfolio holdings of institutions in companies from 23 countries during the period 2003–2008. We find that firm-level governance is positively associated with international institutional investment. Changes in institutional ownership over time positively affect subsequent changes in firm-level governance, but the opposite is not true. Foreign institutions and institutions from countries with strong shareholder protection play a role in promoting governance improvements outside of the U.S. Institutional investors affect not only which corporate governance mechanisms are in place, but also outcomes. Firms with higher institutional ownership are more likely to terminate poorly performing Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and exhibit improvements in valuation over time. Our results suggest that international portfolio investment by institutional investors promotes good corporate governance practices around the world.","['Reena Aggarwal', 'Isil Erel', 'Miguel Ferreira', 'Pedro Matos']","['Institutional investors', 'Corporate governance', 'Shareholder activism']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002540,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,1,Reena Aggarwal,2011,169.21384473605355
Recent trends in trading activity and market quality,"We explore the sharp uptrend in recent trading activity and accompanying changes in market efficiency. Higher turnover has been associated with more frequent smaller trades, which have progressively formed a larger fraction of trading volume over time. Evidence indicates that secular decreases in trading costs have influenced the turnover trend. Turnover has increased the most for stocks with the greatest level of institutional holdings, suggesting professional investing as a key contributor to the turnover trend. Variance ratio tests suggest that more institutional trading has increased information-based trading. Intraday volatility has decreased and prices conform more closely to random walk in recent years. The sensitivity of turnover to past returns has increased and cross-sectional predictability of returns has decreased significantly, revealing a more widespread use of quantitative trading strategies that allow for more efficient securities prices.","['Tarun Chordia', 'Richard Roll', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam']","['Trading volume', 'Market efficiency', 'Volatility']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000730,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,2,Tarun Chordia,2011,169.21384473605355
Stock market aversion? Political preferences and stock market participation,"We find that left-wing voters and politicians are less likely to invest in stocks, controlling for income, wealth, education, and other relevant factors. This finding from unique data sets in Finland is robust both at the zip code and at the individual level. A moderate left voter is 17–20% less likely to own stocks than a moderate right voter. The results are consistent with the idea that personal values are a factor in important investment decisions, in this case leading to “stock market aversion.” The results are inconsistent with alternative explanations such as wealth effects, risk aversion, reverse causality, return expectations, or social capital.","['Markku Kaustia', 'Sami Torstila']","['Household finance', 'Limited participation', 'Political preference']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002539,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,1,Markku Kaustia,2011,169.21384473605355
The disparity between long-term and short-term forecasted earnings growth,"We find the disparity between long-term and short-term analyst forecasted earnings growth is a robust predictor of future returns and long-term analyst forecast errors. After adjusting for industry characteristics, stocks whose long-term earnings growth forecasts are far above or far below their implied short-term forecasts for earnings growth have negative and positive subsequent risk-adjusted returns along with downward and upward revisions in long-term forecasted earnings growth, respectively. Additional results indicate that investor inattention toward firm-level changes in long-term earnings growth is responsible for these risk-adjusted returns.","['Zhi Da', 'Mitch Warachka']","['Analyst forecasts', 'Return predictability']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002515,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,2,Zhi Da,2011,169.21384473605355
Financial literacy and stock market participation,"We have devised two special modules for De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) Household Survey to measure financial literacy and study its relationship to stock market participation. We find that the majority of respondents display basic financial knowledge and have some grasp of concepts such as interest compounding, inflation, and the time value of money. However, very few go beyond these basic concepts; many respondents do not know the difference between bonds and stocks, the relationship between bond prices and interest rates, and the basics of risk diversification. Most importantly, we find that financial literacy affects financial decision-making: Those with low literacy are much less likely to invest in stocks.","['Maarten van Rooij', 'Annamaria Lusardi', 'Rob Alessie']","['Portfolio choice', 'Knowledge of economics and finance', 'Financial sophistication', 'Risk diversification', 'Learning from peers']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000717,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,2,Maarten van Rooij,2011,169.21384473605355
Do small shareholders count?,"We hypothesize that age similarity among small shareholders acts as an implicit coordinating device for their actions and, thus, could represent an indirect source of corporate governance in firms with dispersed ownership. We test this hypothesis on a sample of Swedish firms during the 1995–2000 period. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that compared with shareholders of differing ages, same-age noncontrolling shareholders sell more aggressively following negative firm news; firms with more age-similar small shareholders are more profitable and command higher valuation; and an increase (decline) in a firm's small shareholder age similarity brings a significantly large increase (decline) in its stock price. The last effects are more pronounced in the absence of a controlling shareholder.","['Eugene Kandel', 'Massimo Massa', 'Andrei Simonov']","['Shareholder heterogeneity', 'Firm value', 'Corporate finance', 'Managerial decision making']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000833,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,3,Eugene Kandel,2011,169.21384473605355
Does geography matter? Firm location and corporate payout policy,"We investigate the impact of geography on agency costs and firm dividend policies. We argue that remote firm location increases the cost of shareholder oversight of managerial investment decisions. We hypothesize that remotely located firms facing free cash flow problems precommit to higher dividends to mitigate agency conflicts. We find that remotely located firms pay higher dividends. As expected, the effect of geography on dividends is most pronounced for firms with severe free cash flow problems. Further, remotely located firms rely more on regular dividends instead of special dividends or share repurchases and decrease dividends less often.","['Kose John', 'Anzhela Knyazeva', 'Diana Knyazeva']","['Geography', 'Firm location', 'Proximity to shareholders', 'Dividends', 'Payout policy']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000791,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,3,Kose John,2011,169.21384473605355
Hedge fund leverage,"We investigate the leverage of hedge funds in the time series and cross-section. Hedge fund leverage is counter-cyclical to the leverage of listed financial intermediaries and decreases prior to the start of the financial crisis in mid-2007. Hedge fund leverage is lowest in early 2009 when the market leverage of investment banks is highest. Changes in hedge fund leverage tend to be more predictable by economy-wide factors than by fund-specific characteristics. In particular, decreases in funding costs and increases in market values both forecast increases in hedge fund leverage. Decreases in fund return volatilities predict future increases in leverage.","['Andrew Ang', 'Sergiy Gorovyy', 'Gregory B. van Inwegen']","['Capital structure', 'Long–short positions', 'Alternative investments', 'Exposure', 'Hedging', 'Systemic risk']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001425,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,1,Andrew Ang,2011,169.21384473605355
The CEO pay slice,"We investigate the relation between the CEO Pay Slice (CPS)—the fraction of the aggregate compensation of the top-five executive team captured by the Chief Executive Officer—and the value, performance, and behavior of public firms. The CPS could reflect the relative importance of the CEO as well as the extent to which the CEO is able to extracts rents. We find that, controlling for all standard controls, CPS is negatively associated with firm value as measured by industry-adjusted Tobin's q. CPS also has a rich set of relations with firms' behavior and performance. In particular, CPS is correlated with lower (industry-adjusted) accounting profitability, lower stock returns accompanying acquisitions announced by the firm and higher likelihood of a negative stock return accompanying such announcements, higher odds of the CEO receiving a lucky option grant at the lowest price of the month, lower performance sensitivity of CEO turnover, and lower stock market returns accompanying the filing of proxy statements for periods when CPS increases. Taken together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher CPS is associated with agency problems and indicate that CPS can provide a useful tool for studying the performance and behavior of firms.","['Lucian A.

Employee treatment and firm leverage: A test of the stakeholder theory of capital structure,"We investigate the stakeholder theory of capital structure from the perspective of a firm’s relations with its employees. We find that firms that treat their employees fairly (as measured by high employee‐friendly ratings) maintain low debt ratios. This result is robust to a variety of model specifications and endogeneity issues. The negative relation between leverage and a firm’s ability to treat employees fairly is also evident when we measure its ability by whether it is included in the Fortune magazine list, “100 Best Companies to Work For.” These results suggest that a firm’s incentive or ability to offer fair employee treatment is an important determinant of its financing policy.","['Kee-Hong Bae', 'Jun-Koo Kang', 'Jin Wang']","['Capital structure', 'Employee treatment', 'Stakeholder', 'KLD rating', 'Endogeneity']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002552,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,1,Kee-Hong Bae,2011,169.21384473605355
Bank CEO incentives and the credit crisis,"We investigate whether bank performance during the recent credit crisis is related to chief executive officer (CEO) incentives before the crisis. We find some evidence that banks with CEOs whose incentives were better aligned with the interests of shareholders performed worse and no evidence that they performed better. Banks with higher option compensation and a larger fraction of compensation in cash bonuses for their CEOs did not perform worse during the crisis. Bank CEOs did not reduce their holdings of shares in anticipation of the crisis or during the crisis. Consequently, they suffered extremely large wealth losses in the wake of the crisis.","['Rüdiger Fahlenbrach', 'René M.

Empty voting and the efficiency of corporate governance,"We model corporate voting outcomes when an informed trader, such as a hedge fund, can establish separate positions in a firm's shares and votes (empty voting). The positions are separated by borrowing shares on the record date, hedging economic exposure, or trading between record and voting dates. We find that the trader's presence can improve efficiency overall despite the fact that it sometimes ends up selling to a net short position and then voting to decrease firm value. An efficiency improvement is likely if other shareholders’ votes are not highly correlated with the correct decision or if it is relatively expensive to separate votes from shares on the record date. On the other hand, empty voting will tend to decrease efficiency if it is relatively inexpensive to separate votes from shares and other shareholders are likely to vote the right way.","['Alon Brav', 'Richmond D.

"Banking system control, capital allocation, and economy performance","We observe less efficient capital allocation in countries whose banking systems are more thoroughly controlled by tycoons or families. The magnitude of this effect is similar to that of state control over banking. Unlike state control, tycoon or family control also correlates with slower economic and productivity growth, greater financial instability, and worse income inequality. These findings are consistent with theories that elite-capture of a country’s financial system can embed “crony capitalism.”","['Randall Morck', 'M.

Information spillovers and performance persistence for hedge funds,"We present a simple model that rationalizes performance persistence in hedge fund limited partnerships. In contrast to the model for mutual funds of Berk and Green (2004), the learning in our model pertains to profitability associated with an innovative trading strategy or emerging sector, rather than ability specific to the fund manager. As a result of potential information spillovers, which would increase competition if informed investors were to partner with non-incumbent managers, incumbent managers will let informed investors benefit from increases in estimated profitability following high returns realized with the trading strategy or in the sector.","['Vincent Glode', 'Richard C.

Forecasting stock market returns: The sum of the parts is more than the whole,"We propose forecasting separately the three components of stock market returns—the dividend–price ratio, earnings growth, and price–earnings ratio growth—the sum-of-the-parts (SOP) method. Our method exploits the different time series persistence of the components and obtains out-of-sample R-squares (compared with the historical mean) of more than 1.3% with monthly data and 13.4% with yearly data. This compares with typically negative R-squares obtained in a similar experiment with predictive regressions. The performance of the SOP method comes mainly from the dividend–price ratio and earnings growth components, and the robustness of the method is due to its low estimation error. An investor who timed the market using our method would have had a Sharpe ratio gain of 0.3.","['Miguel A.

Creditor rights and corporate risk-taking,"We propose that stronger creditor rights in bankruptcy affect corporate investment choice by reducing corporate risk-taking. In cross-country analysis, we find that stronger creditor rights induce greater propensity of firms to engage in diversifying acquisitions that are value-reducing, to acquire targets whose assets have high recovery value in default, and to lower cash-flow risk. Also, corporate leverage declines when creditor rights are stronger. These relations are usually strongest in countries where management is dismissed in reorganization and are also observed over time following changes in creditor rights. Our results thus identify a potentially adverse consequence of strong creditor rights.","['Viral V.

International diversification with frontier markets,"We provide an analysis of frontier market equities with respect to world market integration and diversification. Principal component results reveal that frontier markets exhibit low levels of integration. In contrast with developed and emerging markets, frontier markets offer no indication of increasing integration through time. Furthermore, individual frontier market countries do not exhibit consistent rates of changing integration. Structural break tests identify breakpoints in integration, as well as integration dynamics across countries. We show that frontier markets have low integration with the world market and thereby offer significant diversification benefits.","['Dave Berger', 'Kuntara Pukthuanthong', 'J.

The effect of banking crisis on bank-dependent borrowers,"We provide causal evidence that adverse capital shocks to banks affect their borrowers’ performance negatively. We use an exogenous shock to the U.S. banking system during the Russian crisis of Fall 1998 to separate the effect of borrowers’ demand of credit from the supply of credit by the banks. Firms that primarily relied on banks for capital suffered larger valuation losses during this period and subsequently experienced a higher decline in their capital expenditure and profitability as compared to firms that had access to the public-debt market. Consistent with an adverse shock to the supply of credit, crisis-affected banks decreased the quantity of their lending and increased loan interest rates in the post-crisis period significantly more than the unaffected banks. Our results suggest that the global integration of the financial sector can contribute to the propagation of financial shocks from one economy to another through the banking channel.","['Sudheer Chava', 'Amiyatosh Purnanandam']","['Banking crisis', 'Russian default', 'Bank loans', 'Credit crunch']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001820,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,1,Sudheer Chava,2011,169.21384473605355
Vintage capital and creditor protection,"We provide novel evidence linking the level of creditor protection provided by law to the degree of usage of technologically older, vintage capital in the airline industry. Using a panel of aircraft-level data around the world, we find that better creditor rights are associated with both aircraft of a younger vintage and newer technology, as well as firms with larger aircraft fleets. We propose that by mitigating financial shortfalls, enhanced legal protection of creditors facilitates the ability of firms to make large capital investments, adapt advanced technologies, and foster productivity.","['Efraim Benmelech', 'Nittai K.

The role of risk management in mergers and merger waves,"We show that merger activity and particularly waves are significantly driven by risk management considerations. Increases in cash flow uncertainty encourage firms to vertically integrate and this contributes to the start of merger waves. These effects are incremental to previously identified causes of wave activity. Our risk management hypothesis is further supported by cross-sectional differences in the likelihood that a firm vertically integrates, and by the post-acquisition characteristics of vertically integrating firms. These results are consistent with the view (from the industrial organization literature) that vertical integration is an operational hedging mechanism that reduces the cost of increased uncertainty.","['Jon A.

"Structural breaks, parameter uncertainty, and term structure puzzles","We show that uncertainty about parameters of the short rate model can account for the rejections of the expectations hypothesis for the term structure of interest rates. We assume that agents employ Bayes rule to learn parameter values in the context of a model that is subject to stochastic structural breaks. We show that parameter uncertainty also implies that the verdict on the expectations hypothesis varies systematically with the term of the long bond and the particular test employed, in the same way that is found in empirical tests.","['George Bulkley', 'Paolo Giordani']","['Change-point', 'Learning', 'Expectations hypothesis']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001218,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,1,George Bulkley,2011,169.21384473605355
CEO optimism and forced turnover,"We show theoretically that optimism can lead a risk-averse Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to choose the first-best investment level that maximizes shareholder value. Optimism below (above) the interior optimum leads the CEO to underinvest (overinvest). Hence, if boards of directors act in the interests of shareholders, CEOs with relatively low or high optimism face a higher probability of forced turnover than moderately optimistic CEOs face. Using a large sample of turnovers, we find strong empirical support for this prediction. The results are consistent with the view that there is an interior optimum level of managerial optimism that maximizes firm value.","['T. Colin Campbell', 'Michael Gallmeyer', 'Shane A.

Corporate bond default risk: A 150-year perspective,"We study corporate bond default rates using an extensive new data set spanning the 1866–2008 period. We find that the corporate bond market has repeatedly suffered clustered default events much worse than those experienced during the Great Depression. For example, during the railroad crisis of 1873–1875, total defaults amounted to 36% of the par value of the entire corporate bond market. Using a regime-switching model, we examine the extent to which default rates can be forecast by financial and macroeconomic variables. We find that stock returns, stock return volatility, and changes in GDP are strong predictors of default rates. Surprisingly, however, credit spreads are not. Over the long term, credit spreads are roughly twice as large as default losses, resulting in an average credit risk premium of about 80 basis points. We also find that credit spreads do not adjust in response to realized default rates.","['Kay Giesecke', 'Francis A.

The effect of regulation on optimal corporate pension risk,"We study firms' pension prefunding and portfolio allocation choices in a model in which firms trade off the need to compensate workers for the financial risk in their pension benefit against the cost advantage that may be gained by exploiting underpriced pension insurance. In the absence of pension insurance, the firm minimizes costs by rendering promised benefits free of risk to workers, who are assumed to be unable to hedge firm-specific risk. Various forms of government intervention, such as benefit guarantees, can alter this outcome dramatically by providing the firm with an incentive to shift risk to other parties.

Price impact and portfolio impact,"We study survival, price impact, and portfolio impact in heterogeneous economies. We show that, under the equilibrium risk-neutral measure, long-run price impact is in fact equivalent to survival, whereas long-run portfolio impact is equivalent to survival under an agent-specific, wealth-forward measure. These results allow us to show that price impact and portfolio impact are two independent concepts: a nonsurviving agent with no long-run price impact can have a significant long-run impact on other agents' optimal portfolios.","['Jaksa Cvitanić', 'Semyon Malamud']","['Survival', 'Price impact', 'Equilibrium', 'Heterogeneous agents', 'Optimal portfolios']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002758,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,100,1,Jaksa Cvitanić,2011,169.21384473605355
Missing the marks? Dispersion in corporate bond valuations across mutual funds,"We study the dispersion of month-end valuations placed on identical corporate bonds by different mutual funds. Such dispersion is related to bond-specific characteristics associated with liquidity and market volatility. The Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) could have contributed to the general decline in dispersion over our sample period, though other factors most likely played roles. Further tests reveal marking patterns to be consistent with returns smoothing behavior by managers. Funds with ambiguous marking policies and those holding “hard-to-mark” bonds appear more prone to smooth reported returns. From a regulatory perspective, we see little downside to requiring funds to explicitly state their marking standards.","['Gjergji Cici', 'Scott Gibson', 'John J.

The role of securitization in mortgage renegotiation,"We study the effects of securitization on renegotiation of distressed residential mortgages over the current financial crisis. Unlike prior studies, we employ unique data that directly observe lender renegotiation actions and cover more than 60% of the U.S. mortgage market. Exploiting within-servicer variation in these data, we find that bank-held loans are 26–36% more likely to be renegotiated than comparable securitized mortgages (4.2–5.7% in absolute terms). Also, modifications of bank-held loans are more efficient: conditional on a modification, bank-held loans have 9% lower post-modification default rates (3.5% in absolute terms). Our findings support the view that frictions introduced by securitization create a significant challenge to effective renegotiation of residential loans. We also provide evidence supporting the affordability focus of recent policy actions, such as the Home Affordability Modification Program.","['Sumit Agarwal', 'Gene Amromin', 'Itzhak Ben-David', 'Souphala Chomsisengphet', 'Douglas D.

The costs of intense board monitoring,"We study the effects of the intensity of board monitoring on directors' effectiveness in performing their monitoring and advising duties. We find that monitoring quality improves when a majority of independent directors serve on at least two of the three principal monitoring committees. These firms exhibit greater sensitivity of CEO turnover to firm performance, lower excess executive compensation, and reduced earnings management. The improvement in monitoring quality comes at the significant cost of weaker strategic advising and greater managerial myopia. Firms with boards that monitor intensely exhibit worse acquisition performance and diminished corporate innovation. Firm value results suggest that the negative advising effects outweigh the benefits of improved monitoring, especially when acquisitions or corporate innovation are significant value drivers or the firm's operations are complex.","['Olubunmi Faleye', 'Rani Hoitash', 'Udi Hoitash']","['Intense monitoring', 'Board committees', 'Strategic advising', 'Firm value']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11000432,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,101,1,Olubunmi Faleye,2011,169.21384473605355
The structure and formation of business groups: Evidence from Korean chaebols,"We study the evolution of Korean chaebols (business groups) using ownership data. Chaebols grow vertically (as pyramids) when the controlling family uses well-established group firms (“central firms”) to acquire firms with low pledgeable income and high acquisition premiums. Chaebols grow horizontally (through direct ownership) when the family acquires firms with high pledgeable income and low acquisition premiums. Central firms trade at a relative discount, due to shareholders’ anticipation of value-destroying acquisitions. Our evidence is consistent with the selection of firms into different positions in the chaebol and ascribes the underperformance of pyramidal firms to a selection effect rather than tunneling.","['Heitor Almeida', 'Sang Yong Park', 'Marti G.

Liquidity mergers,"We study the interplay between corporate liquidity and asset reallocation. Our model shows that financially distressed firms are acquired by liquid firms in their industries even in the absence of operational synergies. We call these transactions “liquidity mergers,” since their purpose is to reallocate liquidity to firms that are otherwise inefficiently terminated. We show that liquidity mergers are more likely to occur when industry-level asset-specificity is high and firm-level asset-specificity is low. We analyze firms' liquidity policies as a function of real asset reallocation, examining the trade-offs between cash and credit lines. We verify the model's prediction that liquidity mergers are more likely to occur in industries in which assets are industry-specific, but transferable across firms. We also show that firms are more likely to use credit lines (relative to cash) in industries in which liquidity mergers are more frequent.","['Heitor Almeida', 'Murillo Campello', 'Dirk Hackbarth']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Credit lines', 'Cash', 'Asset-specificity', 'Financial distress']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001826,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,3,Heitor Almeida,2011,169.21384473605355
The price of liquidity: The effects of market conditions and bank characteristics,"We study the prices that individual banks pay for liquidity (captured by borrowing rates in repos with the central bank and benchmarked by the overnight index swap) as a function of market conditions and bank characteristics. These prices depend in particular on the distribution of liquidity across banks, which is calculated over time using individual bank-level data on reserve requirements and actual holdings. Banks pay more for liquidity when positions are more imbalanced across banks, consistent with the existence of short squeezing. We also show that small banks pay more for liquidity and are more vulnerable to squeezes. Healthier banks pay less but, contrary to what one might expect, banks in formal liquidity networks do not. State guarantees reduce the price of liquidity but do not protect against squeezes.","['Falko Fecht', 'Kjell G.

Does access to external finance improve productivity? Evidence from a natural experiment,"We study the relation between access to finance and productivity. Our contribution to the literature is a clean identification of a causal effect of access to finance on productivity. Specifically, we exploit an exogenous shift in demand for a product to expose how producers adapt their productivity in the presence of varying levels of access to finance. We use a triple differences testing approach and find that production increases the most over the sample period in areas with relatively strong access to finance, even in comparison with a control group. This result is statistically significant and robust to a variety of controls, alternative variables, and tests. The causal effect of access to finance on productivity that we find speaks to the larger role of finance in economic growth.","['Alexander W.

Stock price fragility,"We study the relation between the ownership structure of financial assets and non-fundamental risk. We define an asset to be fragile if it is susceptible to non-fundamental shifts in demand. An asset can be fragile because of concentrated ownership, or because its owners face correlated or volatile liquidity shocks, i.e., they must buy or sell at the same time. We formalize this idea and apply it to mutual fund ownership of US stocks. Consistent with our predictions, fragility strongly predicts price volatility. We then extend the logic of fragility to investigate two natural extensions: (1) the forecast of stock return comovement and (2) the potentially destabilizing impact of arbitrageurs on stock prices.","['Robin Greenwood', 'David Thesmar']","['Mutual funds', 'Flow-driven trading', 'Non-fundamental risk']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X11001474,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,102,3,Robin Greenwood,2011,169.21384473605355
Simple formulas for standard errors that cluster by both firm and time,"When estimating finance panel regressions, it is common practice to adjust standard errors for correlation either across firms or across time. These procedures are valid only if the residuals are correlated either across time or across firms, but not across both. This paper shows that it is very easy to calculate standard errors that are robust to simultaneous correlation along two dimensions, such as firms and time. The covariance estimator is equal to the estimator that clusters by firm, plus the estimator that clusters by time, minus the usual heteroskedasticity-robust ordinary least squares (OLS) covariance matrix.

Do time-varying risk premiums explain labor market performance?,"Within the standard search and matching model, time-to-build implies that high aggregate risk premiums should forecast low employment growth in the short run but high employment growth in the long run. If there is also time-to-plan, high risk premiums should forecast low net hiring rates in the short run but high net hiring rates in the long run. Our evidence indicates two-quarter time-to-build in the aggregate payroll data, no time-to-plan in the aggregate hiring data, but two-quarter time-to-plan in the job creation data for manufacturing firms. High payroll growth and high net job creation rate in manufacturing also forecast low stock market excess returns at business cycle frequencies.","['Long Chen', 'Lu Zhang']","['Time-varying risk premiums', 'Payroll growth', 'Hiring rate', 'Search and matching frictions', 'Labor markets']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10002084,Journal of Financial Economics,0.4859270479699689,99,2,Long Chen,2011,169.21384473605355
Labor income dynamics at business-cycle frequencies: Implications for portfolio choice,"Young agents with low wealth-income ratios counter factually hold more stock than young, rich agents and old agents using the standard portfolio choice model with i.i.d. stock returns and labor income.

Our results suggest that the predictability of labor income growth at a business-cycle frequency, particularly the countercyclical variation in volatility, plays an important role in a young agent's decision making about her portfolio's stock holding.","['Anthony W.

"Bailouts, the incentive to manage risk, and financial crises","A firm's termination leads to bankruptcy costs. This may create an incentive for outside stakeholders or the firm's debtholders to bail out the firm as bankruptcy looms. Because of this implicit guarantee, firm shareholders have an incentive to increase volatility in order to exploit the implicit protection. However, if they increase volatility too much they may induce the guarantee-extending parties to “walk away.” I derive the optimal risk management rule in such a framework and show that it allows high volatility choices, while net worth is high. However, risk limits tighten abruptly when the firm's net worth declines below an endogenously determined threshold. Hence, the model reproduces the qualitative features of existing risk management rules, and can account for phenomena such as “flight to quality.”",['Stavros Panageas'],"['Continuous time methods', 'Default', 'Implicit guarantees', 'Risk management', 'Bailouts']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002384,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,3,Stavros Panageas,2010,169.12970060639861
Corporate venture capital and the returns to acquiring portfolio companies,"A prominent motive for corporate venture capital (CVC) is the identification of entrepreneurial-firm acquisition opportunities. Consistent with this view, we find that one of every five startups purchased by 61 top corporate investors from 1987 through 2003 is a venture portfolio company of its acquirer. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that takeovers of portfolio companies destroy significant value for shareholders of acquisitive CVC investors, even though these same investors are “good acquirers” of other entrepreneurial firms. We explore numerous explanations for these puzzling findings, which seem rooted in managerial overconfidence or agency problems at the program level.","['David Benson', 'Rosemarie H.

"Trade credit, collateral liquidation, and borrowing constraints","Assuming that firms’ suppliers are better able to extract value from the liquidation of assets in default and have an information advantage over other creditors, the paper derives six predictions on the use of trade credit. (1) Financially unconstrained firms (with unused bank credit lines) take trade credit to exploit the supplier's liquidation advantage. (2) If inputs purchased on account are sufficiently liquid, the reliance on trade credit does not depend on credit rationing. (3) Firms buying goods make more purchases on account than those buying services, while suppliers of services offer more trade credit than those of standardized goods. (4) Suppliers lend inputs to their customers but not cash. (5) Greater reliance on trade credit is associated with more intensive use of tangible inputs. (6) Better creditor protection decreases both the use of trade credit and input tangibility.","['Daniela Fabbri', 'Anna Maria C.

Sentiment and stock prices: The case of aviation disasters,"Behavioral economic studies reveal that negative sentiment driven by bad mood and anxiety affects investment decisions and may hence affect asset pricing. In this study we examine the effect of aviation disasters on stock prices. We find evidence of a significant negative event effect with an average market loss of more than $60 billion per aviation disaster, whereas the estimated actual loss is no more than $1 billion. In two days a price reversal occurs. We find the effect to be greater in small and riskier stocks and in firms belonging to less stable industries. This event effect is also accompanied by an increase in the perceived risk: implied volatility increases after aviation disasters without an increase in actual volatility.","['Guy Kaplanski', 'Haim Levy']","['Event effect', 'Reversal effect', 'Market sentiment', 'Behavioral finance', 'Disasters']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002086,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,2,Guy Kaplanski,2010,169.12970060639861
Auctioned IPOs: The US evidence,"Between 1999 and 2007, WR Hambrecht completed 19 initial public offerings (IPOs) in the US using an auction mechanism. We analyze investor behavior and mechanism performance in these auctioned IPOs using detailed bidding data. The existence of some bids posted at high prices suggests that some investors (mostly retail) try to free-ride on the mechanism. But institutional demand in these auctions is very elastic, suggesting that institutional investors reveal information in the bidding process. Investor participation is largely predictable based on deal size, and demand is dominated by institutions. Flipping is at most as prevalent in auctions as in bookbuilt deals. But, unlike in bookbuilding, investors in auctions do not flip their shares more in “hot” deals. Finally, we find that institutional investors, who provide more information, are rewarded by obtaining a larger share of the deals that have higher 10-day underpricing. Our results therefore suggest that auctioned IPOs can be an effective alternative to traditional bookbuilding.","['François Degeorge', 'François Derrien', 'Kent L.

"Seasoned equity offerings, market timing, and the corporate lifecycle","Both a firm's market-timing opportunities and its corporate lifecycle stage exert statistically and economically significant influences on the probability that it conducts a seasoned equity offering (SEO), with the lifecycle effect empirically stronger. Neither effect adequately explains SEO decisions because a near-majority of issuers are not growth firms and the vast majority of firms with high M/B ratios and high recent and poor future stock returns fail to issue stock. Since without the offer proceeds 62.6% of issuers would run out of cash (81.1% would have subnormal cash balances) the year after the SEO, a near-term cash need is the primary SEO motive, with market-timing opportunities and lifecycle stage exerting only ancillary influences.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'René M.

Does corporate governance matter in competitive industries?,"By reducing the threat of a hostile takeover, business combination (BC) laws weaken corporate governance and increase the opportunity for managerial slack. Consistent with the notion that competition mitigates managerial slack, we find that while firms in non-competitive industries experience a significant drop in operating performance after the laws’ passage, firms in competitive industries experience no significant effect. When we examine which agency problem competition mitigates, we find evidence in support of a “quiet-life” hypothesis. Input costs, wages, and overhead costs all increase after the laws’ passage, and only so in non-competitive industries. Similarly, when we conduct event studies around the dates of the first newspaper reports about the BC laws, we find that while firms in non-competitive industries experience a significant stock price decline, firms in competitive industries experience a small and insignificant stock price impact.","['Xavier Giroud', 'Holger M.

Why do firms appoint CEOs as outside directors?,"Companies actively seek to appoint outside CEOs to their boards. Consistent with our matching theory of outside CEO board appointments, we show that such appointments have a certification benefit for the appointing firm. CEOs are more likely to join boards of large established firms that are geographically close, pursue similar financial and investment policies, and have comparable governance to their own firms. The first outside CEO director appointment has a higher stock-price reaction than the appointment of another outside director. Except for a decrease in operating performance following the appointment of an interlocked director, CEO directors do not affect the appointing firm's operating performance, decision-making, and CEO compensation.","['Rüdiger Fahlenbrach', 'Angie Low', 'René M.

Capital structure decisions: Evidence from deregulated industries,"Deregulation significantly affects the firms’ operating environment and leverage decisions. Firms experience a significant decline in profitability, asset tangibility and a significant increase in growth opportunities following deregulation. Firms respond by reducing leverage. Deregulation also significantly affects the cross-sectional relation between leverage and its determinants. Leverage is much less negatively correlated with profitability and market-to-book and much more positively (negatively) correlated with firm size (earnings volatility) following deregulation. These results are consistent with the dynamic tradeoff theory of capital structure. Also consistent with the dynamic tradeoff theory, those firms that are more likely to be above their target capital structure issue significantly more equity in the first few years following deregulation.",['Alexei V.

Liquidity and valuation in an uncertain world,"During the 2007–2009 financial crisis there was little or no trading in a variety of financial assets, even though bid and ask prices existed for many of these assets. We develop a model in which this illiquidity arises from uncertainty, and we argue that this new form of illiquidity makes bid and ask prices unsuitable as metrics for establishing “fair value” for these assets. We show how the extreme uncertainty that traders face can be characterized by incomplete preferences over portfolios, and we use Bewley's (2002) model of decision making under uncertainty to derive equilibrium quotes and the nonexistence of trading at these quotes. We then suggest alternatives for valuing assets in illiquid markets.","['David Easley', 'Maureen O’Hara']","['Liquidity', 'Uncertainty', 'Subprime crisis', 'Fair value accounting']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000474,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,1,David Easley,2010,169.12970060639861
Will the U.S. bank recapitalization succeed? Eight lessons from Japan,"During the financial crisis that started in 2007, the U.S. government has used a variety of tools to try to rehabilitate the U.S. banking industry. Many of those strategies were also used in Japan to combat its banking problems in the 1990s. There are also a surprising number of other similarities between the current U.S. crisis and the recent Japanese crisis. The Japanese policies were only partially successful in recapitalizing the banks until the economy finally started to recover in 2003. From these unsuccessful attempts, we derive eight lessons. In light of these eight lessons, we assess the policies the U.S. has pursued. The U.S. has ignored three of the lessons and it is too early to evaluate the U.S. policies with respect to four of the others.

Asset liquidity and financial contracts: Evidence from aircraft leases,"Financial contracting theories agree that more-liquid assets decrease the expected cost of external financing, thus making leasing more attractive and reducing lessors’ equilibrium return. However, the literature has ambiguous predictions about the effect of liquidity on the maturity of leases. These predictions are further complicated by the existence of two types of lease contracts—operating and capital—that differ in whether asset ownership transfers to the lessee at the end of the contract. Using data from commercial aircraft, I find that more-liquid assets (1) make leasing, operating leasing in particular, more likely; (2) have shorter operating leases; (3) have longer capital leases; and (4) command lower markups of operating lease rates.",['Alessandro Gavazza'],"['Leasing', 'Collateral', 'Asset liquidity']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001652,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,1,Alessandro Gavazza,2010,169.12970060639861
The subprime credit crisis and contagion in financial markets,"I conduct an empirical investigation into the pricing of subprime asset-backed collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and their contagion effects on other markets. Using data for the ABX subprime indexes, I find strong evidence of contagion in the financial markets. The results support the hypothesis that financial contagion was propagated primarily through liquidity and risk-premium channels, rather than through a correlated-information channel. Surprisingly, ABX index returns forecast stock returns and Treasury and corporate bond yield changes by as much as three weeks ahead during the subprime crisis. This challenges the popular view that the market prices of these “toxic assets” were unreliable; the results suggest that significant price discovery did in fact occur in the subprime market during the crisis.",['Francis A.

Average correlation and stock market returns,"If the Roll critique is important, changes in the variance of the stock market may be only weakly related to changes in aggregate risk and subsequent stock market excess returns. However, since individual stock returns share a common sensitivity to true market return shocks, higher aggregate risk can be revealed by higher correlation between stocks. In addition, a change in stock market variance that leaves aggregate risk unchanged can have a zero or even negative effect on the stock market risk premium. We show that the average correlation between daily stock returns predicts subsequent quarterly stock market excess returns. We also show that changes in stock market risk holding average correlation constant can be interpreted as changes in the average variance of individual stocks. Such changes have a negative relation with future stock market excess returns.","['Joshua M.

The marketing of seasoned equity offerings,"In an accelerated seasoned equity offering (SEO), an issuer foregoes the investment bank's marketing efforts in return for a lower fee. To explain why many issuing firms choose a higher cost fully marketed offer, we posit that the marketing effort flattens the issuer's short-run demand curve. Alternatively stated, with a fully marketed offer, the issuer is paying investment bankers to create demand, making the elasticity of demand at the time of issuance an endogenous choice variable.

Limited participation and consumption-saving puzzles: A simple explanation and the role of insurance,"In this paper, we show that the existence of a large, negative wealth shock and insufficient insurance against such a shock could explain both the limited stock market participation puzzle and the low-consumption–high-savings puzzle. We then conduct an empirical analysis on the relation between household portfolio choices and access to private insurance and various types of government safety nets. The empirical results demonstrate that a lack of insurance against large, negative wealth shocks is positively correlated with lower participation rates and higher saving rates. Overall, the evidence suggests an important role of insurance in household investment and savings decisions.","['Todd Gormley', 'Hong Liu', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Limited participation', 'Insurance', 'Saving', 'Consumption']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000024,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,2,Todd Gormley,2010,169.12970060639861
Renegotiation of cash flow rights in the sale of VC-backed firms,"Incomplete contracting theory suggests that venture capitalist (VC) cash flow rights, including liquidation preferences, could be subject to renegotiation. Using a hand-collected data set of sales of Silicon Valley firms, we find common shareholders do sometimes receive payment before VCs’ liquidation preferences are satisfied. However, such deviations from VCs' cash flow rights tend to be small. We also find that renegotiation is more likely when governance arrangements, including the firm's choice of corporate law, give common shareholders more power to impede the sale. Our study provides support for incomplete contracting theory, improves understanding of VC exits, and suggests that choice of corporate law matters in private firms.","['Brian Broughman', 'Jesse Fried']","['Venture capital', 'Preferred stock', 'Liquidation preferences', 'Corporate governance', 'Incomplete contracting']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002116,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,3,Brian Broughman,2010,169.12970060639861
A skeptical appraisal of asset pricing tests,"It has become standard practice in the cross-sectional asset pricing literature to evaluate models based on how well they explain average returns on size-B/M portfolios, something many models seem to do remarkably well. In this paper, we review and critique the empirical methods used in the literature. We argue that asset pricing tests are often highly misleading, in the sense that apparently strong explanatory power (high cross-sectional R2s and small pricing errors) can provide quite weak support for a model. We offer a number of suggestions for improving empirical tests and evidence that several proposed models do not work as well as originally advertised.","['Jonathan Lewellen', 'Stefan Nagel', 'Jay Shanken']","['Asset pricing', 'Cross-sectional tests', 'Power']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001950,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,2,Jonathan Lewellen,2010,169.12970060639861
"Creditor rights, information sharing, and bank risk taking","Looking at a sample of nearly 2,400 banks in 69 countries, we find that stronger creditor rights tend to promote greater bank risk taking. Consistent with this finding, we also show that stronger creditor rights increase the likelihood of financial crisis. On the plus side, we find that stronger creditor rights are associated with higher growth. In contrast, we find that the benefits of information sharing among creditors appear to be universally positive. Greater information sharing leads to higher bank profitability, lower bank risk, a reduced likelihood of financial crisis, and higher economic growth.","['Joel F.

Negotiations under the threat of an auction,"Many takeovers occur after one-on-one negotiations, which suggests a troubling lack of competition. We seek to determine whether acquirers in such friendly deals are truly insulated from competitive pressures. We study two countervailing influences: (1) potential but unobserved latent competition, i.e., the likelihood that rival bidders could appear, and (2) anticipated auction costs when negotiations fail. Using various proxies, we find that latent competition increases the bid premium offered in negotiated deals and that auction costs reduce the premium.","['Nihat Aktas', 'Eric de Bodt', 'Richard Roll']","['Merger negotiations', 'Latent competition', 'Auction costs', 'Bid premium']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001510,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,2,Nihat Aktas,2010,169.12970060639861
"Monotonicity in asset returns: New tests with applications to the term structure, the CAPM, and portfolio sorts","Many theories in finance imply monotonic patterns in expected returns and other financial variables. The liquidity preference hypothesis predicts higher expected returns for bonds with longer times to maturity; the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) implies higher expected returns for stocks with higher betas; and standard asset pricing models imply that the pricing kernel is declining in market returns. The full set of implications of monotonicity is generally not exploited in empirical work, however. This paper proposes new and simple ways to test for monotonicity in financial variables and compares the proposed tests with extant alternatives such as t-tests, Bonferroni bounds, and multivariate inequality tests through empirical applications and simulations.","['Andrew J.

Liquidity biases in asset pricing tests,"Microstructure noise in security prices biases the results of empirical asset pricing specifications, particularly when security-level explanatory variables are cross-sectionally correlated with the amount of noise. We focus on tests of whether measures of illiquidity, which are likely to be correlated with the noise, are priced in the cross-section of stock returns, and show a significant upward bias in estimated return premiums for an array of illiquidity measures in Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) monthly return data. The upward bias is larger when illiquid securities are included in the sample, but persists even for NYSE/Amex stocks after decimalization. We introduce a methodological correction to eliminate the biases that simply involves weighted least squares (WLS) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, and find evidence of smaller, but still significant, return premiums for illiquidity after implementing the correction.","['Elena Asparouhova', 'Hendrik Bessembinder', 'Ivalina Kalcheva']","['Microstructure noise', 'Illiquidity', 'Asset pricing', 'Return premium', 'Bias correction']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002591,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,2,Elena Asparouhova,2010,169.12970060639861
Going public to acquire? The acquisition motive in IPOs,"Newly public firms make acquisitions at a torrid pace. Their large acquisition appetites reflect the concentration of initial public offerings (IPOs) in mergers and acquisitions-(M&A-) intensive industries, but acquisitions by IPO firms also outpace those by mature firms in the same industry. IPO firms’ acquisition activity is fueled by the initial capital infusion at the IPO and through the creation of an acquisition currency used to raise capital for both cash- and stock-financed acquisitions along with debt issuance subsequent to the IPO. IPO firms play a bigger role in the M&A process by participating as acquirers than they do as takeover targets, and acquisitions are as important to their growth as research and development (R&D) and capital expenditures (CAPEX). The pattern of acquisitions following an IPO shapes the evolution of ownership structure of newly public firms.","['Ugur Celikyurt', 'Merih Sevilir', 'Anil Shivdasani']","['Initial public offerings', 'Acquisitions', 'Mergers', 'Acquisition currency']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000462,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,3,Ugur Celikyurt,2010,169.12970060639861
"Habit formation, the cross section of stock returns and the cash-flow risk puzzle","Non-linear external habit persistence models, which feature prominently in the recent “equity premium” asset pricing and macroeconomics literature, generate counterfactual predictions in the cross-section of stock returns. In particular, we show that in the absence of cross-sectional heterogeneity in firms’ cash-flow risk, these models produce a “growth premium,” that is, stocks with high price-to-fundamental ratios command a higher premium than stocks with low price-to-fundamental ratios. This implication is at odds with the well-established empirical observation of a “value premium” in the cross-section of stock returns. Substantial heterogeneity in firms’ cash-flow risk yields both a value premium as well as most of the stylized facts about the cross-section of stock returns, but it generates a “cash-flow risk puzzle”: Quantitatively, value stocks have to have “too much” cash-flow risk compared to the data to generate empirically plausible value premiums.","['Tano Santos', 'Pietro Veronesi']","['Habit', 'Value premium', 'Cross-section', 'Cash-flow risk']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001157,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,2,Tano Santos,2010,169.12970060639861
"More insiders, more insider trading: Evidence from private-equity buyouts","Prior theoretical research has found that, in the absence of regulation, a greater number of insiders leads to more insider trading.

We construct measures of the likelihood of insider activity prior to bid announcements of private-equity buyouts during the period 2000–2006 and relate these to the number of financing participants. Suspicious stock and options activity is associated with more equity participants, while suspicious bond and CDS activity is associated with more debt participants — consistent with models of limited competition among insiders but inconsistent with our model of optimal regulation.","['Viral V.

We examine whether commercially available corporate governance rankings provide useful information for shareholders. Our results suggest that they do not.

Using financing constraints to proxy for investment frictions, we show only weak evidence that the investment-to-assets and asset growth effects in the cross section of returns are stronger in financially more constrained firms than in financially less constrained firms. There is no evidence that q-theory with investment frictions explains the investment growth, net stock issues, abnormal corporate investment, or net operating assets anomalies. Limits-to-arbitrage proxies dominate q-theory with investment frictions in explaining the magnitude of the investment-to-assets and asset growth anomalies in direct comparisons.","['Dongmei Li', 'Lu Zhang']","['Investment-based asset pricing', 'Asset pricing anomalies', 'Investment frictions', 'The discount rate', 'Financing constraints']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001509,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,2,Dongmei Li,2010,169.12970060639861
Detecting jumps from Lévy jump diffusion processes,Recent asset-pricing models incorporate jump risk through Lévy processes in addition to diffusive risk. This paper studies how to detect stochastic arrivals of small and big Lévy jumps with new nonparametric tests. The tests allow for robust analysis of their separate characteristics and facilitate better estimation of return dynamics. Empirical evidence of both small and big jumps based on these tests suggests that models for individual equities and overall market indices require incorporating Lévy-type jumps. The evidence of small jumps also helps explain why jumps in the market index are uncorrelated with jumps in its component equities.,"['Suzanne S.

"Comovement, information production, and the business cycle","Recent theoretical research suggests that information production is a positive externality of aggregate economic activity (Veldkamp, 2005). Both the quantity and quality of information increase during periods of economic expansion and decrease during periods of contraction. Based on this insight, we hypothesize and confirm that time-varying information production drives the comovement patterns observed in stock returns. We examine stock return comovement in 36 countries from 1980 to 2007 and show that, consistent with the theory, comovement patterns are countercyclical; that is, when information production is high (low), comovement is low (high). We also find that the relation between comovement and the business cycle is stronger in countries that experience large intertemporal swings in information production. Finally, we show that the relation between business cycle and comovement is stronger in poor countries, countries with less developed financial markets, and countries with weaker accounting and transparency standards. These results suggest that financial development and transparency are conducive to a steady flow of financial information over the business cycle.","['Paul Brockman', 'Ivonne Liebenberg', 'Maria Schutte']","['Information production', 'Volatility', 'Comovement', 'Business cycle', 'Financial development']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000516,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,1,Paul Brockman,2010,169.12970060639861

We study the time-series properties and the determinants of the options/stock trading volume ratio (O/S) using a comprehensive cross-section and time-series of data on equities and their listed options. O/S is related to many intuitive determinants such as delta and trading costs, and it also varies with institutional holdings, analyst following, and analyst forecast dispersion. O/S is higher around earnings announcements, suggesting increased trading in the options market. Further, post-announcement absolute returns are positively related to pre-announcement O/S, which suggests that at least part of the pre-announcement options trading is informed.","['Richard Roll', 'Eduardo Schwartz', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam']","['Options', 'Stock', 'Trading volume', 'Information']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002347,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,1,Richard Roll,2010,169.12970060639861
Short selling in initial public offerings,"Short sale constraints in the aftermarket of initial public offerings (IPOs) are often used to explain short-term underpricing that is subsequently reversed. This paper shows that short selling is integral to aftermarket trading and is higher in IPOs with greater underpricing. Perceived restrictions on borrowing shares are not systematically circumvented by “naked” short selling. Short sellers, on average, do not appear to earn abnormal profits in the near term and our findings are not driven by market makers.

The good news in short interest,"Stocks with relatively high short interest subsequently experience negative abnormal returns, but the effect can be transient and of debatable economic significance. In contrast, relatively heavily traded stocks with low short interest experience both statistically and economically significant positive abnormal returns. These positive returns are often larger (in absolute value) than the negative returns observed for heavily shorted stocks. Thus, the positive information associated with low short interest, which is publicly available, is only slowly incorporated into prices, which raises a broader market efficiency issue. Our results also cast doubt on existing theories of the impact of short sale constraints.","['Ekkehart Boehmer', 'Zsuzsa R. Huszar', 'Bradford D.

Are family firms more tax aggressive than non-family firms?,"Taxes represent a significant cost to the firm and shareholders, and it is generally expected that shareholders prefer tax aggressiveness. However, this argument ignores potential non-tax costs that can accompany tax aggressiveness, especially those arising from agency problems. Firms owned/run by founding family members are characterized by a unique agency conflict between dominant and small shareholders. Using multiple measures to capture tax aggressiveness and founding family presence, we find that family firms are less tax aggressive than their non-family counterparts, ceteris paribus. This result suggests that family owners are willing to forgo tax benefits to avoid the non-tax cost of a potential price discount, which can arise from minority shareholders’ concern with family rent-seeking masked by tax avoidance activities [Desai and Dharmapala, 2006. Corporate tax avoidance and high-powered incentives. Journal of Financial Economics 79, 145–179]. Our result is also consistent with family owners being more concerned with the potential penalty and reputation damage from an IRS audit than non-family firms.

Uncertainty about average profitability and the diversification discount,"The diversification discount (multiple segment firm value below the value imputed using single segment firm multiples) is commonly thought to be generated by agency problems, a lack of transparency, or lackluster future prospects for diversified firms. If multiple segment firms have lower uncertainty about mean profitability than single segment firms, rational learning about mean profitability provides an alternative explanation for the diversification discount that does not rely on suboptimal managerial decisions or a poor firm outlook. Empirical tests which examine changes in firm value across the business cycle and idiosyncratic volatility are consistent with lower uncertainty about mean profitability for multiple segment firms.","['John Hund', 'Donald Monk', 'Sheri Tice']","['Diversification discount', 'Rational learning models', 'Internal capital markets']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000383,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,3,John Hund,2010,169.12970060639861

Payoff complementarities and financial fragility: Evidence from mutual fund outflows,"The paper provides empirical evidence that strategic complementarities among investors generate fragility in financial markets.

We also find that this pattern disappears in funds where the shareholder base is composed mostly of large investors. We present further evidence that these results are not attributable to alternative explanations based on the informativeness of past performance or on clientele effects.

Preferred risk habitat of individual investors,"The preferred risk habitat hypothesis, introduced here, is that individual investors select stocks whose volatilities are commensurate with their risk aversion. The data, 1995–2000 holdings of over 20,000 clients at a large German broker, are consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis: the returns of stocks within each portfolio have remarkably similar volatilities, when stocks are sold they are replaced by stocks of similar volatilities, and the more risk-averse customers indeed hold less volatile stocks. Greater volatility specialization is associated with lower Sharpe ratios, primarily because more specialized investors hold fewer stocks and thereby expose themselves to more unsystematic risk.","['Daniel Dorn', 'Gur Huberman']","['Empirical portfolio choice', 'Risk aversion', 'Narrow framing']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000565,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,1,Daniel Dorn,2010,169.12970060639861
Do subjective expectations explain asset pricing puzzles?,"The structural uncertainty model with Bayesian learning, advanced by Weitzman (AER 2007), provides a framework for gauging the effect of structural uncertainty on asset prices and risk premiums. This paper provides an operational version of this approach that incorporates realistic priors about consumption growth volatility, while guaranteeing finite asset pricing quantities. In contrast to the extant literature, the resulting asset pricing model with subjective expectations yields well-defined expected utility, finite moment generating function of the predictive distribution of consumption growth, and tractable expressions for equity premium and risk-free return. Our quantitative analysis reveals that explaining the historical equity premium and risk-free return, in the context of subjective expectations, requires implausible levels of structural uncertainty. Furthermore, these implausible prior beliefs result in consumption disaster probabilities that virtually coincide with those implied by more realistic priors. At the same time, the two sets of prior beliefs have diametrically opposite asset pricing implications.","['Gurdip Bakshi', 'Georgios Skoulakis']","['Subjective expectations', 'Learning', 'Structural uncertainty', 'Priors', 'Predictive density of consumption growth', 'Equity premium', 'Risk-free return']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001583,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,3,Gurdip Bakshi,2010,169.12970060639861
The world price of home bias,"Theoretical arguments suggest that as the degree of a country's home bias increases, the global risk sharing between domestic and foreign investors will reduce and thereby increase the country's cost of capital. Consistent with this prediction, we find international differences in the cost of capital to be strongly and positively related to varying degrees of home bias for 38 markets. This finding is robust to different cost of capital proxies, different control variables, alternative home-bias measures, international tradability of stocks, and alternative specifications. Therefore, the overall evidence implies that countries may enjoy a significantly lower cost of capital by reducing the extent of their home bias and hence, increasing global risk sharing.","['Sie Ting Lau', 'Lilian Ng', 'Bohui Zhang']","['Mutual fund holdings', 'Cost of capital', 'Market segmentation', 'Home bias']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000796,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,2,Sie Ting Lau,2010,169.12970060639861
Resolving the exposure puzzle: The many facets of exchange rate exposure,"Theory predicts sizeable exchange rate (FX) exposure for many firms. However, empirical research has not documented such exposures. To examine this discrepancy, we extend prior theoretical results to model a global firm's FX exposure and show empirically that firms pass through part of currency changes to customers and utilize both operational and financial hedges. For a typical sample firm, pass-through and operational hedging each reduce exposure by 10–15%. Financial hedging with foreign debt, and to a lesser extent FX derivatives, decreases exposure by about 40%. The combination of these factors reduces FX exposures to observed levels.","['Söhnke M.

We study dual-class shares with equal cash flow rights and show that a simple trading strategy exploiting gaps between their prices appears to create abnormal profits after transactions costs. Trade and quote data show that investors shift their trading patterns to take advantage of gaps. Contrary to common perception, long–short arbitrage plays a minor part in eliminating gaps, and one-sided trades correct most of them.

Optimal exercise of executive stock options and implications for firm cost,"This paper conducts a comprehensive study of the optimal exercise policy for an executive stock option and its implications for option cost, average life, and alternative valuation concepts. The paper is the first to provide analytical results for an executive with general concave utility. Wealthier or less risk-averse executives exercise later and create greater option cost. However, option cost can decline with volatility. We show when there exists a single exercise boundary, yet demonstrate the possibility of a split continuation region. We also show that, for constant relative risk averse utility, the option value does not converge to the Black and Scholes value as the correlation between the stock and the market portfolio converges to one. We compare our model's option cost with the modified Black and Scholes approximation typically used in practice and show that the approximation error can be large or small, positive or negative, depending on firm characteristics.","['Jennifer N.

Inside the black box: The role and composition of compensation peer groups,"This paper considers the features of the newly disclosed compensation peer groups and demonstrates their significant role in explaining variations in chief executive officer (CEO) compensation beyond that of other benchmarks such as the industry-size peers. After controlling for industry, size, visibility, CEO responsibility, and talent flows, we find that firms appear to select highly paid peers to justify their CEO compensation and this effect is stronger in firms where the compensation peer group is smaller, where the CEO is the chairman of the board of directors, where the CEO has longer tenure, and where directors are busier serving on multiple boards.","['Michael Faulkender', 'Jun Yang']","['Executive compensation', 'Peer groups', 'Benchmarking']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000206,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,2,Michael Faulkender,2010,169.12970060639861
Liquidity risk and the cross-section of hedge-fund returns,"This paper demonstrates that liquidity risk as measured by the covariation of fund returns with unexpected changes in aggregate liquidity is an important determinant in the cross-section of hedge-fund returns. The results show that funds that significantly load on liquidity risk subsequently outperform low-loading funds by about 6% annually, on average, over the period 1994–2008, while negative performance is observed during liquidity crises. The returns are independent of the liquidity a fund provides to its investors as measured by lockup and redemption notice periods, and they are also robust to commonly used hedge-fund factors, none of which carries a significant premium during the sample period. These findings highlight the importance of understanding systematic liquidity variations in the evaluation of hedge-fund performance.",['Ronnie Sadka'],"['Liquidity risk', 'Hedge funds', 'Price impact', 'Asset pricing']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001133,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,1,Ronnie Sadka,2010,169.12970060639861
Activist arbitrage: A study of open-ending attempts of closed-end funds,"This paper documents frequent attempts by activist arbitrageurs to open-end discounted closed-end funds, particularly after the 1992 proxy reform which reduced the costs of communication among shareholders. Open-ending attempts have a substantial effect on discounts, reducing them, on average, to half of their original level. The size of the discount is a major determinant of whether a fund gets attacked. Other important factors include the costs of communication among shareholders and the governance structure of the targeted fund. Our study contributes to the understanding of the actions undertaken by arbitrageurs in financial markets beyond just pure trading.","['Michael Bradley', 'Alon Brav', 'Itay Goldstein', 'Wei Jiang']","['Activist arbitrage', 'Closed-end funds', 'Communication', 'Feedback effects', 'Proxy reform']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001664,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,1,Michael Bradley,2010,169.12970060639861
"Institutional investors, intangible information, and the book-to-market effect","This paper establishes a robust link between the trading behavior of institutions and the book-to-market effect. Building on work by Daniel and Titman (2006), who argue that the book-to-market effect is driven by the reversal of intangible returns, I find that institutions tend to buy (sell) shares in response to positive (negative) intangible information and that the reversal of the intangible return is most pronounced among stocks for which a large proportion of active institutions trade in the direction of intangible information. Furthermore, the book-to-market effect is large and significant in stocks with intense past institutional trading but nonexistent in stocks with moderate institutional trading. This influence of institutional trading on the book-to-market effect is distinct from that of firm size. These results are consistent with the view that the tendency of institutions to trade in the direction of intangible information exacerbates price overreaction, thereby contributing to the value premium.",['Hao Jiang'],"['Book-to-market effect', 'Institutional investors', 'Intangible information', 'Overreaction']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002372,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,1,Hao Jiang,2010,169.12970060639861
Measuring the timing ability and performance of bond mutual funds,"This paper evaluates the ability of bond funds to “market time” nine common factors related to bond markets. Timing ability generates nonlinearity in fund returns as a function of common factors, but there are several non-timing-related sources of nonlinearity. Controlling for the non-timing-related nonlinearity is important. Funds’ returns are more concave than benchmark returns, and this would appear as poor timing ability in naive models. With controls, the timing coefficients appear neutral to weakly positive. Adjusting for nonlinearity, the performance of many bond funds is significantly negative on an after-cost basis, but significantly positive on a before-cost basis.","['Yong Chen', 'Wayne Ferson', 'Helen Peters']","['Mutual funds', 'Market timing', 'Bond funds', 'Investment Performance Evaluation']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001352,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,1,Yong Chen,2010,169.12970060639861
Optimal compensation contracts when managers can hedge,"This paper examines optimal compensation contracts when executives can hedge their personal portfolios. In a simple principal-agent framework, I predict that the Chief Executive Officer's (CEO's) pay-performance sensitivity decreases with the executive-hedging cost. Empirically, I find evidence supporting the model's prediction. Providing further support for the theory, I show that shareholders also impose a high sensitivity of CEO wealth to stock volatility and increase financial leverage to resolve the executive-hedging problem. Moreover, executives with lower hedging costs hold more exercisable in-the-money options, have weaker incentives to cut dividends, and pursue fewer corporate diversification initiatives. Overall, the manager's ability to hedge the firm's risk affects governance mechanisms and managerial actions.",['Huasheng Gao'],"['Executive compensation', 'Hedging', 'Equity incentives']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1000070X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,2,Huasheng Gao,2010,169.12970060639861
Bank activity and funding strategies: The impact on risk and returns,"This paper examines the implications of bank activity and short-term funding strategies for bank risk and return using an international sample of 1,334 banks in 101 countries leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Expansion into noninterest income-generating activities such as trading increases the rate of return on assets, and it could offer some risk diversification benefits at very low levels. Nondeposit, wholesale funding in contrast lowers the rate of return on assets, while it can offer some risk reduction at commonly observed low levels of nondeposit funding. A sizable proportion of banks, however, attract most of their short-term funding in the form of nondeposits at a cost of enhanced bank fragility. Overall, banking strategies that rely prominently on generating noninterest income or attracting nondeposit funding are very risky, consistent with the demise of the US investment banking sector.","['Asli Demirgüç-Kunt', 'Harry Huizinga']","['Noninterest income share', 'Wholesale funding', 'Diversification', 'Universal banking', 'Bank fragility', 'Financial crisis']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001534,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,3,Asli Demirgüç-Kunt,2010,169.12970060639861
Risk and CEO turnover,"This paper investigates how performance risk impacts a board's ability to learn about the unknown talent of a chief executive officer (CEO). We theorize that the information content of performance is increasing in idiosyncratic risk and decreasing in systematic risk. We provide robust empirical evidence that the likelihood of CEO turnover is increasing in idiosyncratic risk and decreasing in systematic risk and that turnover-performance-sensitivity is also increasing in idiosyncratic risk and decreasing in systematic risk. We further investigate relations between the threat of termination and CEO compensation, showing that for retained CEOs, both subsequent pay-performance-sensitivity and pay levels decrease in the probability of turnover.","['Robert Bushman', 'Zhonglan Dai', 'Xue Wang']","['CEO turnover', 'Idiosyncratic risk', 'Systematic risk', 'CEO compensation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000449,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,3,Robert Bushman,2010,169.12970060639861
Institutional monitoring through shareholder litigation,"This paper investigates the effectiveness of using securities class action lawsuits in monitoring defendant firms by institutional lead plaintiffs from two aspects: (1) immediate litigation outcomes, including the probability of surviving the motion to dismiss and the settlement amount, and (2) subsequent governance improvement such as changes in board independence. Using a large sample of securities lawsuits from 1996 to 2005, we show that institutional investors are more likely to serve as the lead plaintiff for lawsuits with certain characteristics. After controlling for these determinants of having an institutional lead plaintiff, we show that securities class actions with institutional owners as lead plaintiffs are less likely to be dismissed and have larger monetary settlements than securities class actions with individual lead plaintiffs. This effect exists for various types of institutions including public pension funds. We also find that, after the lawsuit filings, defendant firms with institutional lead plaintiffs experience greater improvement in their board independence than defendant firms with individual lead plaintiffs. Our study suggests that securities litigation is an effective disciplining tool for institutional owners.","['C.S.

"Ownership concentration, foreign shareholding, audit quality, and stock price synchronicity: Evidence from China","This paper investigates the effects of largest-shareholder ownership concentration, foreign ownership, and audit quality on the amount of firm-specific information incorporated into share prices, as measured by stock price synchronicity, of Chinese-listed firms over the 1996–2003 period. We show that synchronicity is a concave function of ownership by the largest shareholder with its maximum at an approximate 50% level. Further, we find that synchronicity is higher when the largest shareholder is government related. We also find that foreign ownership and auditor quality are inversely associated with synchronicity. Finally, we show that the amount of earnings information reflected in stock returns is lower for firms with high synchronicity.","['Ferdinand A. Gul', 'Jeong-Bon Kim', 'Annie A.

The role of private equity group reputation in LBO financing,"This paper investigates whether the reputation of acquiring private equity groups (PEGs) is related to the financing structure of leveraged buyouts (LBOs). Using a sample of 180 public-to-private LBOs in the US between January 1, 1997 and August 15, 2007, we find that reputable PEGs are more active in the LBO market when credit risk spreads are low and lending standards in the credit markets are lax. We also find that reputable PEGs pay narrower bank and institutional loan spreads, have longer loan maturities, and rely more on institutional loans. In addition, while we find that PEG reputation is positively related to buyout leverage (i.e., LBO debt divided by pre-LBO earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) of the target), and leverage is significantly positively related to buyout pricing, we do not find any direct relation between PEG reputation and buyout valuations. The evidence suggests that PEG reputation is related to LBO financing structure not only because reputable PEGs are more likely to take advantage of market timing in credit markets and but also because PEG reputation reduces agency costs of LBO debt.","['Cem Demiroglu', 'Christopher M.

Performance persistence in entrepreneurship,"This paper presents evidence of performance persistence in entrepreneurship. We show that entrepreneurs with a track record of success are much more likely to succeed than first-time entrepreneurs and those who have previously failed. In particular, they exhibit persistence in selecting the right industry and time to start new ventures. Entrepreneurs with demonstrated market timing skill are also more likely to outperform industry peers in their subsequent ventures. This is consistent with the view that if suppliers and customers perceive the entrepreneur to have market timing skill, and is therefore more likely to succeed, they will be more willing to commit resources to the firm. In this way, success breeds success and strengthens performance persistence.","['Paul Gompers', 'Anna Kovner', 'Josh Lerner', 'David Scharfstein']","['Private equity', 'New ventures', 'Venture capital']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002311,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,1,Paul Gompers,2010,169.12970060639861
"First-passage probability, jump models, and intra-horizon risk","This paper proposes a risk measure, based on first-passage probability, which reflects intra-horizon risk in jump models with finite or infinite jump activity. Our empirical investigation shows, first, that the proposed risk measure consistently exceeds the benchmark value-at-risk (VaR). Second, jump risk tends to amplify intra-horizon risk. Third, we find large variation in our risk measure across jump models, indicative of model risk. Fourth, among the jump models we consider, the finite-moment log-stable model provides the most conservative risk estimates. Fifth, imposing more stringent VaR levels accentuates the impact of intra-horizon risk in jump models. Finally, using an alternative benchmark VaR does not dilute the role of intra-horizon risk. Overall, we contribute by showing that ignoring intra-horizon risk can lead to underestimation of risk exposures.","['Gurdip Bakshi', 'George Panayotov']","['Intra-period risk', 'First-passage probability', 'Value-at-risk', 'Jump-models']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001500,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,1,Gurdip Bakshi,2010,169.12970060639861
The market for certification by external parties: Evidence from underwriting and banking relationships,"This paper provides evidence that an underwriter is better able to certify an equity issue if it has a lending relationship with the firm. An announcement of being underwritten by the firm’s lending-relationship bank reduces ex post information asymmetry, thereby improving the announcement return. Further, because this reduction in information asymmetry effectively disseminates what was previously the lending bank’s private information, it decreases its affiliated market maker’s information advantage, thus reducing its contribution to price discovery and liquidity. These results provide evidence on the value of information production and transmission by banks, and more generally on the role of external parties in reducing information asymmetry.",['Tiago Duarte-Silva'],"['Certification', 'Securities underwriting', 'Universal banking', 'Market making']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001753,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,3,Tiago Duarte-Silva,2010,169.12970060639861
The performance of emerging hedge funds and managers,"This paper provides the first systematic analysis of performance patterns for emerging funds and managers in the hedge fund industry. Emerging funds and managers have particularly strong financial incentives to create investment performance and, because of their size, may be more nimble than established ones. Performance measurement, however, needs to control for the usual biases afflicting hedge fund databases. After adjusting for such biases and using a novel event time approach, we find strong evidence of outperformance during the first two to three years of existence. Each additional year of age decreases performance by 42 basis points, on average. Cross-sectionally, early performance by individual funds is quite persistent, with early strong performance lasting for up to five years.","['Rajesh K.

"Market liquidity, asset prices, and welfare","This paper represents an equilibrium model for the demand and supply of liquidity and its impact on asset prices and welfare. We show that, when constant market presence is costly, purely idiosyncratic shocks lead to endogenous demand of liquidity and large price deviations from fundamentals. Moreover, market forces fail to lead to efficient supply of liquidity, which calls for potential policy interventions. However, we demonstrate that different policy tools can yield different efficiency consequences. For example, lowering the cost of supplying liquidity on the spot (e.g., through direct injection of liquidity or relaxation of ex post margin constraints) can decrease welfare while forcing more liquidity supply (e.g., through coordination of market participants) can improve welfare.","['Jennifer Huang', 'Jiang Wang']","['Liquidity', 'Asset prices', 'Welfare', 'Central bank policy']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001676,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,1,Jennifer Huang,2010,169.12970060639861
Bank lending during the financial crisis of 2008,"This paper shows that new loans to large borrowers fell by 47% during the peak period of the financial crisis (fourth quarter of 2008) relative to the prior quarter and by 79% relative to the peak of the credit boom (second quarter of 2007). New lending for real investment (such as working capital and capital expenditures) fell by only 14% in the last quarter of 2008, but contracted nearly as much as new lending for restructuring (LBOs, M&As, share repurchases) relative to the peak of the credit boom. After the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, there was a run by short-term bank creditors, making it difficult for banks to roll over their short term debt. We find that there was a simultaneous run by borrowers who drew down their credit lines, leading to a spike in commercial and industrial loans reported on bank balance sheets. We examine whether these two stresses on bank liquidity led them to cut lending. In particular, we show that banks cut their lending less if they had better access to deposit financing and thus, they were not as reliant on short-term debt. We also show that banks that were more vulnerable to credit-line drawdowns because they co-syndicated more of their credit lines with Lehman Brothers reduced their lending to a greater extent.","['Victoria Ivashina', 'David Scharfstein']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002396,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,3,Victoria Ivashina,2010,169.12970060639861
Informed trading before analyst downgrades: Evidence from short sellers,"This paper studies short-selling prior to the release of analyst downgrades in a sample of 670 downgrades of Nasdaq stocks between 2000 and 2001. We find abnormal levels of short-selling in the three days before downgrades are publicly announced. Further, we show that this pre-announcement abnormal short-selling is significantly related to the subsequent share price reaction to the downgrade, and especially so for downgrades that prompt the most substantial price declines. Our findings are robust to various controls that might also affect short-selling such as pre-announcement momentum, three-day pre-announcement returns, and announcement-day share price. In addition, the results are independent of scheduled earnings announcements, analyst herding, and non-routine events near downgrades. Further evidence suggests that tipping is more consistent with the data than the prediction explanation which posits that short sellers successfully predict downgrades on the basis of public information about firms’ financial health. Finally, we present evidence that downgraded stocks with high abnormal short-selling perform poorly over the subsequent six months by comparison with those with low abnormal short-selling. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that short sellers are informed traders and exploit profitable opportunities provided by downgrade announcements.","['Stephen E. Christophe', 'Michael G.

When are outside directors effective?,"This paper uses recent regulations that have required some companies to increase the number of outside directors on their boards to generate estimates of the effect of board independence on performance that are largely free from endogeneity problems. Our main finding is that the effectiveness of outside directors depends on the cost of acquiring information about the firm: when the cost of acquiring information is low, performance increases when outsiders are added to the board, and when the cost of information is high, performance worsens when outsiders are added to the board. The estimates provide some of the cleanest estimates to date that board independence matters, and the finding that board effectiveness depends on information cost supports a nascent theoretical literature emphasizing information asymmetry. We also find that firms compose their boards as if they understand that outsider effectiveness varies with information costs.","['Ran Duchin', 'John G.

Chief executive officer (CEO) equity incentives have been shown to be associated with accruals management and the likelihood of beating analyst forecasts (Bergstresser and Philippon, 2006; Cheng and Warfield, 2005). Because CFOs’ primary responsibility is financial reporting, CFO equity incentives should play a stronger role than those of the CEO in earnings management. We find that the magnitude of accruals and the likelihood of beating analyst forecasts are more sensitive to CFO equity incentives than to those of the CEO.

Nature or nurture: What determines investor behavior?,"Using data on identical and fraternal twins’ complete financial portfolios, we decompose the cross-sectional variation in investor behavior. We find that a genetic factor explains about one-third of the variance in stock market participation and asset allocation. Family environment has an effect on the behavior of young individuals, but this effect is not long-lasting and disappears as an individual gains experience. Frequent contact among twins results in similar investment behavior beyond a genetic factor. Twins who grew up in different environments still display similar investment behavior. Our interpretation of a genetic component of the decision to invest in the stock market is that there are innate differences in factors affecting effective stock market participation costs. We attribute the genetic component of asset allocation—the relative amount invested in equities and the portfolio volatility—to genetic variation in risk preferences.","['Amir Barnea', 'Henrik Cronqvist', 'Stephan Siegel']","['Portfolio Choice', 'Investor Heterogeneity', 'Behavioral Genetics']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001777,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,3,Amir Barnea,2010,169.12970060639861

Club deals in leveraged buyouts,"We analyze the pricing and characteristics of club deal leveraged buyouts (LBOs)—those in which two or more private equity partnerships jointly conduct an LBO. Using a comprehensive sample of completed LBOs of U.S. publicly traded targets conducted by prominent private equity firms, we find that target shareholders receive approximately 10% less of pre-bid firm equity value, or roughly 40% lower premiums, in club deals compared to sole-sponsored LBOs. This result is concentrated before 2006 and in target firms with low institutional ownership. These results are robust to controls for target and deal characteristics, including size, Q, measures of risk, and time and industry fixed effects. We find little support for benign motivations for club deals based on capital constraints, diversification motives, or the ability of clubs to obtain favorable debt amounts or prices, but it is possible that the lower pricing of club deals is an inadvertent byproduct of an unobserved benign motivation for club formation.","['Micah S.

The Sarbanes-Oxley act and corporate investment: A structural assessment,"We assess the impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on corporate investment in an investment Euler equation framework. We allow a dummy for the passage of the Act to affect the rate at which managers discount future investment payoffs. Using generalized method of moments estimators, we find that the rate U.S. firm managers apply to discount investment projects rises significantly after 2002, while the discount rate for U.K. firms remains unchanged. The effects of the legislation on corporate investment are asymmetric, and are much more significant among relatively small firms. We also find that well-governed firms, firms with a credit rating, and accelerated filers of Section 404 of the Act have become more cautious about investment.","['Qiang Kang', 'Qiao Liu', 'Rong Qi']","['Sarbanes-Oxley Act', 'Investment Euler equation', 'Investment-implied discount rate', 'Corporate governance']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1000022X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,2,Qiang Kang,2010,169.12970060639861
Paulson's gift,"We calculate the costs and benefits of the largest ever US government intervention in the financial sector announced during the 2008 Columbus-day weekend. We estimate that this intervention increased the value of banks’ financial claims by $130 billion (bn) at a taxpayers’ cost of $21–$44 billion with a net benefit between $86 and $109 bn. By looking at the limited cross section, we infer that this net benefit arises from a reduction in the probability of bankruptcy, which we estimate would destroy 22% of the enterprise value. The big winners of the plan were the bondholders of the three former investment banks and Citigroup, while the losers were JP Morgan shareholders and the US taxpayers.","['Pietro Veronesi', 'Luigi Zingales']","['Banking crisis', 'Bailout', 'TARP']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000541,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,3,Pietro Veronesi,2010,169.12970060639861
Reduced-form valuation of callable corporate bonds: Theory and evidence,We develop a reduced-form approach for valuing callable corporate bonds by characterizing the call probability via an intensity process. Asymmetric information and market frictions justify the existence of a call-arrival intensity from the market's perspective. Our approach both extends the reduced-form model of Duffie and Singleton (1999) for defaultable bonds to callable bonds and captures some important differences between call and default decisions. A comprehensive empirical analysis of callable bonds using both our model and the more traditional American option approach for valuing callable bonds shows that the reduced-form model fits callable bond prices well and that it outperforms the traditional approach both in- and out-of-sample.,"['Robert Jarrow', 'Haitao Li', 'Sheen Liu', 'Chunchi Wu']","['Callable bond', 'Reduced-form model', 'Affine models']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002074,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,2,Robert Jarrow,2010,169.12970060639861
Evaluating asset pricing models using the second Hansen-Jagannathan distance,"We develop a specification test and a sequence of model selection procedures for non-nested, overlapping, and nested models based on the second Hansen-Jagannathan distance, which requires a good asset pricing model to not only have small pricing errors but also be arbitrage free. Our methods have reasonably good finite sample performances and are more powerful than existing ones in detecting misspecified models with small pricing errors but are not arbitrage-free and in differentiating models that have similar pricing errors of a given set of test assets. Using the Fama and French size and book-to-market portfolios, we reach dramatically different conclusions on model performances based on our approach and existing methods.","['Haitao Li', 'Yuewu Xu', 'Xiaoyan Zhang']","['Stochastic discount factor', 'Specification test', 'Model selection', 'Hansen-Jagannathan distance', 'Arbitrage']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000450,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,2,Haitao Li,2010,169.12970060639861
Estimating affine multifactor term structure models using closed-form likelihood expansions,"We develop and implement a technique for closed-form maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of multifactor affine yield models. We derive closed-form approximations to likelihoods for nine Dai and Singleton (2000) affine models. Simulations show our technique very accurately approximates true (but infeasible) MLE. Using US Treasury data, we estimate nine affine yield models with different market price of risk specifications. MLE allows non-nested model comparison using likelihood ratio tests; the preferred model depends on the market price of risk. Estimation with simulated and real data suggests our technique is much closer to true MLE than Euler and quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) methods.","['Yacine Aït-Sahalia', 'Robert L.

Board interlocks and the propensity to be targeted in private equity transactions,"We examine how board networks affect change-of-control transactions by investigating whether directors’ deal exposure acquired through board service at different companies affect their current firms’ likelihood of being targeted in a private equity-backed, take-private transaction. In our sample of all US publicly traded firms in 2000–2007, we find that companies which have directors with private equity deal exposure gained from interlocking directorships are approximately 42% more likely to receive private equity offers. The magnitude of this effect varies with the influence of directors on their current boards and the quality of these directors’ previous take-private experience, and it is robust to the most likely classes of alternative explanations—endogenous matching between directors and firms and proactive stacking of board composition by management. The analysis shows that board members and their social networks influence which companies become targets in change-of-control transactions.","['Toby E.

The effect of state antitakeover laws on the firm's bondholders,"We examine how state antitakeover laws affect bondholders and the cost of debt, and report four findings. First, bonds issued by firms incorporated in takeover-friendly states have significantly higher at-issue yield spreads than bonds issued by firms in states with restrictive antitakeover laws. Second, firms in takeover friendly states have significantly higher leverage than their counterparts in restrictive law states. Third, bond issues are associated with negative average stock price reactions among firms in takeover-friendly states, but positive stock price reactions among firms in restrictive law states. Fourth, existing bond values increase, on average, upon the introduction of Business Combination antitakeover law. These results indicate that state antitakeover laws tend to decrease bond yields and increase bond values, which is the opposite of their effect on equity values. This, in turn, implies that state laws help mitigate the agency cost of debt by shielding bondholders from expropriation in takeovers. Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that the effect of antitakeover provisions on firm value must take into account the impacts of both bondholders and stockholders.","['Bill B.

Escape from New York: The market impact of loosening disclosure requirements,"We examine the first significant deregulation of U.S. disclosure requirements since the passage of the 1933/1934 Exchange and Securities Acts: the 2007 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 12h-6. Rule 12h-6 has made it easier for foreign firms to deregister with the SEC and thereby terminate their U.S. disclosure obligations. We show that the market reacted negatively to the announcement by the SEC that firms from countries with weak disclosure and governance regimes could more easily opt out of the stringent U.S. reporting and legal environment. We also find that since the rule's passage, an unprecedented number of firms have deregistered, and these firms often had been previous targets of U.S. class action securities lawsuits or SEC enforcement actions. Our findings suggest that shareholders of non-U.S firms place significant value on U.S. securities regulations, especially when the home country investor protections are weak.","['Nuno Fernandes', 'Ugur Lel', 'Darius P.

Political rights and the cost of debt,"We examine the impact of country-level political rights on the cost of debt for corporate bonds issued by firms incorporated in 39 countries. Similar to, but separate from, the relation for creditor rights, greater political rights are associated with lower yield spreads. A one standard deviation increase in political rights is associated with an 18.6% decline in bond spreads. We find evidence that political and legal institutions are substitutes; marginal improvements in political rights produce greater reductions in the cost of debt for firms from countries with weaker creditor rights. We examine potential factors through which political rights may affect the cost of debt and find that greater freedom of the press provides an important channel for reducing bond risks. Moreover, debt of firms with cross-listed equity trades at a premium in U.S. markets, but this relation appears to be more consistent with improved visibility than with bonding effects.","['Yaxuan Qi', 'Lukas Roth', 'John K.

"Local institutional investors, information asymmetries, and equity returns","We examine the informational role of geographically proximate institutions in stock markets. We find that both the level of and change in local institutional ownership predict future stock returns, particularly for firms with high information asymmetry; in contrast, such predictive abilities are relatively weak for nonlocal institutional ownership. The local advantage is especially evident for local investment advisors, high local ownership institutions, and high local turnover institutions. We also find that the stocks that local institutional investors hold (trade) earn higher excess returns around future earnings announcements than those that nonlocal institutional investors hold (trade).","['Bok Baik', 'Jun-Koo Kang', 'Jin-Mo Kim']","['Local institutional ownership', 'Information asymmetry', 'Stock return', 'Investment advisor', 'Informed trading']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000498,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,1,Bok Baik,2010,169.12970060639861
Profiting from government stakes in a command economy: Evidence from Chinese asset sales,"We examine the market response to an unexpected announcement of the sale of government-owned shares in China. In contrast to earlier work, we find a negative effect of government ownership on returns at the announcement date and a symmetric positive effect from the policy's cancellation. We suggest that this results from the absence of a Chinese political transition to accompany economic reforms, so that the benefits of political ties outweigh the efficiency costs of government shareholdings. Companies managed by former government officials have positive abnormal returns, suggesting that personal ties can substitute for government ownership as a source of connections.","['Charles W.

The value of excess cash and corporate governance: Evidence from US cross-listings,"We examine whether and how a US cross-listing mitigates the risk that insiders will turn their firm’s cash holdings into private benefits. We find strong evidence that the value investors attach to excess cash reserves is substantially larger for foreign firms listed on US exchanges and over-the-counter than for their domestic peers. Further, we show that this excess-cash premium stems not only from the strength of US legal rules and disclosure requirements, but also from the greater informal monitoring pressure that accompanies a US listing. Overall, because investors’ valuation of excess cash mirrors how they expect the cash to be used, our analysis shows that a US listing constrains insiders’ inefficient allocation of corporate cash reserves significantly.","['Laurent Frésard', 'Carolina Salva']","['International cross-listing', 'Corporate governance', 'Cash holdings', 'Liquidity']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000930,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,2,Laurent Frésard,2010,169.12970060639861
Securitization and distressed loan renegotiation: Evidence from the subprime mortgage crisis,"We examine whether securitization impacts renegotiation decisions of loan servicers, focusing on their decision to foreclose a delinquent loan. Conditional on a loan becoming seriously delinquent, we find a significantly lower foreclosure rate associated with bank-held loans when compared to similar securitized loans: across various specifications and origination vintages, the foreclosure rate of delinquent bank-held loans is 3% to 7% lower in absolute terms (13% to 32% in relative terms). There is a substantial heterogeneity in these effects with large effects among borrowers with better credit quality and small effects among lower quality borrowers. A quasi-experiment that exploits a plausibly exogenous variation in securitization status of a delinquent loan confirms these results.","['Tomasz Piskorski', 'Amit Seru', 'Vikrant Vig']","['Securitization', 'Renegotiation', 'Incentives', 'Crisis', 'Defaults']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000929,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,97,3,Tomasz Piskorski,2010,169.12970060639861
Inter-temporal variation in the illiquidity premium,"We find evidence of a systematic link between monetary conditions and inter-temporal variation in the price of liquidity. Specifically, following an expansive monetary policy shift, funding conditions improve and market-wide liquidity increases, which is especially beneficial for illiquid securities. The improved liquidity and funding conditions reduce the returns required for holding illiquid securities. Consequently, illiquid stocks experience relatively large price increases when monetary conditions become expansive, and thus, the measured return spread between illiquid and liquid stocks expands substantially. Overall, our evidence supports the claim that the price of asset liquidity is dependent on monetary conditions.","['Gerald R.

Using an explicit and intuitive proxy for the exercise rule, we derive tractable pricing formulas using a short-maturity asymptotic expansion. Depending on model parameters, this method can accurately price options with time-to-maturity up to several years. The main advantage of our approach over existing methods lies in its straightforward extension to models with stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates. We exploit this advantage by providing an analysis of the impact of volatility mean-reversion, volatility of volatility, and correlations on the American put price.","['Alexey Medvedev', 'Olivier Scaillet']",[],[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10000760,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,1,Alexey Medvedev,2010,169.12970060639861
The value of independent directors: Evidence from sudden deaths,"We investigate contributions of independent directors to shareholder value by examining stock price reactions to sudden deaths in the US from 1994 to 2007. We find, first, that following director death stock prices drop by 0.85% on average. Second, the degree of independence and board structure determine the marginal value of independent directors. Third, independence is more valuable in crucial board functions. Finally, controlling for director-invariant heterogeneity using a fixed effect approach, we identify the value of independence over and above the value of individual skills and competences. Overall, our results suggest that independent directors provide a valuable service to shareholders.","['Bang Dang Nguyen', 'Kasper Meisner Nielsen']","['Independent director', 'Sudden death', 'Board of directors', 'Corporate governance', 'Firm value']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X10001741,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,98,3,Bang Dang Nguyen,2010,169.12970060639861

How does law affect finance? An examination of equity tunneling in Bulgaria,"We model and test the mechanisms through which law affects tunneling and tunneling affects firm valuation. In 2002, Bulgaria adopted legal changes which limit equity tunneling through dilutive equity offerings and freezeouts. Following the changes, minority shareholders participate equally in equity offerings, where before they suffered severe dilution; freezeout offer price ratios quadruple; and Tobin's q rises sharply for firms at high risk of tunneling. The paper shows the importance of legal rules in limiting equity tunneling, the role of equity tunneling risk as a factor in determining equity prices, and substitution by controlling shareholders between different forms of tunneling.","['Vladimir Atanasov', 'Bernard Black', 'Conrad Ciccotello', 'Stanley Gyoshev']","['Equity tunneling', 'Preemptive rights', 'Dilution', 'Freezeout', 'Controlling shareholder', 'Securities law', 'Emerging markets']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002530,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,1,Vladimir Atanasov,2010,169.12970060639861
Unstable banking,"We propose a theory of financial intermediaries operating in markets influenced by investor sentiment. In our model, banks make, securitize, distribute, and trade loans, or they hold cash. They also borrow money, using their security holdings as collateral. Banks maximize profits, and there are no conflicts of interest between bank shareholders and creditors. The theory predicts that bank credit and real investment will be volatile when market prices of loans are volatile, but it also points to the instability of banks, especially leveraged banks, participating in markets. Profit-maximizing behavior by banks creates systemic risk.","['Andrei Shleifer', 'Robert W.

"The pecking order, debt capacity, and information asymmetry","We quantify the empirical relevance of the pecking order hypothesis using a novel empirical model and testing strategy that addresses statistical power concerns with previous tests. While the classificatory ability of the pecking order varies significantly depending on whether one interprets the hypothesis in a strict or liberal (e.g., “modified” pecking order) manner, the pecking order is never able to accurately classify more than half of the observed financing decisions. However, when we expand the model to incorporate factors typically attributed to alternative theories, the predictive accuracy of the model increases dramatically—accurately classifying over 80% of the observed debt and equity issuances. Finally, we show that what little pecking order behavior can be found in the data is driven more by incentive conflicts, as opposed to information asymmetry.","['Mark T. Leary', 'Michael R.

Have the tax benefits of debt been overestimated?,"We re-examine the claim that many corporations are underleveraged in that they fail to take full advantage of debt tax shields. We show prior results suggesting underleverage stems from biased estimates of tax benefits from interest deductions. We develop improved estimates of marginal tax rates using a non-parametric procedure that produces more accurate estimates of the distribution of future taxable income. We show that additional debt would provide firms with much smaller tax benefits than previously thought, and when expected distress costs and difficult-to-measure non-debt tax shields are also considered, it appears plausible that most firms have tax-efficient capital structures.","['Jennifer Blouin', 'John E.

A resolution of the distress risk and leverage puzzles in the cross section of stock returns,"We revisit findings that returns are negatively related to financial distress intensity and leverage. These are puzzles under frictionless capital markets assumptions but are consistent with optimizing firms that differ in their exposure to financial distress costs. Firms with high costs choose low leverage to avoid distress, but they retain exposure to the systematic risk of bearing such costs in low states. Empirical results are consistent with this explanation. The return premiums to low leverage and low distress are significant in raw returns, and even stronger in risk-adjusted returns. When in distress, low-leverage firms suffer more than high-leverage firms as measured by a deterioration in accounting operating performance and heightened exposure to systematic risk. The connection between return premiums and distress costs is apparent in subperiod evidence. Both are small or insignificant prior to 1980 and larger and significant thereafter.","['Thomas J.

Dynamic asset allocation with stochastic income and interest rates,We solve for optimal portfolios when interest rates and labor income are stochastic with the expected income growth being affine in the short-term interest rate in order to encompass business cycle variations in wages. Our calibration based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data supports this relation with substantial variation across individuals in the slope of this affine function.

When should firms share credit with employees? Evidence from anonymously managed mutual funds,"We study the choice between named and anonymous mutual fund managers. We argue that fund families weigh the benefits of naming managers against the cost associated with their increased future bargaining power. Named managers receive more media mentions, have greater inflows, and suffer less return diversion due to within family cross-subsidization, but departures of named managers reduce net flows. Naming managers became less common between 1993 and 2004. This was especially true in the asset classes and cities most affected by the hedge fund boom, which increased outside opportunities for, and the cost of retaining, successful named managers.","['Massimo Massa', 'Jonathan Reuter', 'Eric Zitzewitz']","['Mutual funds', 'Named managers', 'Marketing', 'Media', 'Favoritism']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002128,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,95,3,Massimo Massa,2010,169.12970060639861
Quantifying private benefits of control from a structural model of block trades,"We study the determinants of private benefits of control in negotiated block transactions. We estimate the block pricing model in Burkart, Gromb and Panunzi (2000) explicitly accounting for both block premiums and block discounts in the data. The evidence suggests that the occurrence of a block premium or discount depends on the controlling block holder's ability to fight a potential tender offer for the target's stock. We find evidence of large private benefits of control and of associated deadweight losses, but also of value creation by controlling shareholders. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with Jensen's free cash flow hypothesis.","['Rui Albuquerque', 'Enrique Schroth']","['Block pricing', 'Control transactions', 'Private benefits of control', 'Structural estimation', 'Deadweight loss']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09002414,Journal of Financial Economics,0.40176876336000156,96,1,Rui Albuquerque,2010,169.12970060639861
"Costly external finance, corporate investment, and the subprime mortgage credit crisis","We study the effect of the recent financial crisis on corporate investment. The crisis represents an unexplored negative shock to the supply of external finance for non-financial firms. Corporate investment declines significantly following the onset of the crisis, controlling for firm fixed effects and time-varying measures of investment opportunities. Consistent with a causal effect of a supply shock, the decline is greatest for firms that have low cash reserves or high net short-term debt, are financially constrained, or operate in industries dependent on external finance. To address endogeneity concerns, we measure firms’ financial positions as much as four years prior to the crisis, and confirm that similar results do not follow placebo crises in the summers of 2003–2006. Nor do similar results follow the negative demand shock caused by September 11, 2001. The effects weaken considerably beginning in the third quarter of 2008, when the demand-side effects of the crisis became apparent. Additional analysis suggests an important precautionary savings motive for seemingly excess cash that is generally overlooked in the literature.","['Ran Duchin', 'Oguzhan Ozbas', 'Berk A.

The real effects of financial constraints: Evidence from a financial crisis,"We survey 1,050 Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) in the U.S., Europe, and Asia to directly assess whether their firms are credit constrained during the global financial crisis of 2008. We study whether corporate spending plans differ conditional on this survey-based measure of financial constraint. Our evidence indicates that constrained firms planned deeper cuts in tech spending, employment, and capital spending. Constrained firms also burned through more cash, drew more heavily on lines of credit for fear banks would restrict access in the future, and sold more assets to fund their operations. We also find that the inability to borrow externally caused many firms to bypass attractive investment opportunities, with 86% of constrained U.S. CFOs saying their investment in attractive projects was restricted during the credit crisis of 2008. More than half of the respondents said they canceled or postponed their planned investments. Our results also hold in Europe and Asia, and in many cases are stronger in those economies. Our analysis adds to the portfolio of approaches and knowledge about the impact of credit constraints on real firm behavior.","['Murillo Campello', 'John R. Graham', 'Campbell R.

What drives corporate liquidity? An international survey of cash holdings and lines of credit,"We survey chief financial officers from 29 countries to examine whether and why firms use lines of credit versus non-operational (excess) cash for their corporate liquidity. We find that these two liquidity sources are employed to hedge against different risks. Non-operational cash guards against future cash flow shocks in bad times, while credit lines give firms the option to exploit future business opportunities available in good times. Lines of credit are the dominant source of liquidity for companies around the world, comprising about 15% of assets, while less than half of the cash held by companies is held for non-operational purposes, comprising about 2% of assets. Across countries, firms make greater use of lines of credit when external credit markets are poorly developed.","['Karl V.

CEOs versus CFOs: Incentives and corporate policies,"We undertake a broad-based study of the effect of managerial risk-taking incentives on corporate financial policies and show that the risk-taking incentives of chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) significantly influence their firms’ financial policies. In particular, we find that CEOs’ risk-decreasing (-increasing) incentives are associated with lower (higher) leverage and higher (lower) cash balances. CFOs’ risk-decreasing (-increasing) incentives are associated with safer (riskier) debt-maturity choices and higher (lower) earnings-smoothing through accounting accruals. We exploit the stock option expensing regulation of 2004 to establish a causal link between managerial incentives and corporate policies.

Identifying the effects of a lender of last resort on financial markets: Lessons from the founding of the fed,"We use the founding of the Federal Reserve to identify the effects of a lender of last resort. We examine stock return and interest rate volatility during September and October, when markets were vulnerable because of financial stringency from the harvest. Stock volatility fell by 40% and interest rate volatility by more than 70% following the monetary regime change. The drop is insignificant if major panic years are omitted from the analysis, however. Because business cycle downturns occurred in the same year as financial crises, our results suggest that the existence of the Federal Reserve reduced liquidity risk.","['Asaf Bernstein', 'Eric Hughson', 'Marc D.

Using returns of (i) S&P 500 index calls, (ii) calls on major international equity indexes, (iii) digital calls, (iv) upside variance contracts, and (v) a theoretical construct that we denote as kernel call, we find broad support for the implications of U-shaped pricing kernels.

On the reversal of return and dividend growth predictability: A tale of two periods,"A disconcerting, albeit generally accepted, finding is that aggregate stock returns are predictable by dividend yield but dividend growth is unpredictable. I show that part of this lack of dividend growth predictability stems from how dividend growth is constructed. I then show a dramatic reversal of predictability in the 134 years during 1872–2005: stock returns are largely unpredictable in the first seven decades, but become predictable in the postwar period; dividend growth is strongly predictable in the prewar years but this predictability disappears in the postwar years.

Performance evaluation and self-designated benchmark indexes in the mutual fund industry,"Almost one-third of actively managed, diversified U.S. equity mutual funds specify a size and value/growth benchmark index in the fund prospectus that does not match the fund's actual style. Nevertheless, these “mismatched” benchmarks matter to fund investors. Performance relative to the specified benchmark is a significant determinant of a fund's subsequent cash inflows, even controlling for performance measures that better capture the fund's style. These incremental flows appear unlikely to be rational responses to abnormal returns.

Public and private enforcement of securities laws: Resource-based evidence,"Ascertaining which enforcement mechanisms work to protect investors has been both a focus of recent work in academic finance and an issue for policy-making at international development agencies. According to recent academic work, private enforcement of investor protection via both disclosure and private liability rules goes hand in hand with financial market development, but public enforcement fails to correlate with financial development and, hence, is unlikely to facilitate it. Our results confirm the disclosure result but reverse the results on both liability standards and public enforcement. We use securities regulators’ resources to proxy for regulatory intensity of the securities regulator. When we do, financial depth regularly, significantly, and robustly correlates with stronger public enforcement. In horse races between these resource-based measures of public enforcement intensity and the most common measures of private enforcement, public enforcement is overall as important as disclosure in explaining financial market outcomes around the world and more important than private liability rules. Hence, policymakers who reject public enforcement as useful for financial market development are ignoring the best currently available evidence.","['Howell E. Jackson', 'Mark J.

Furthermore, firms whose boards are conventionally and socially independent award a significantly lower level of compensation, exhibit stronger pay-performance sensitivity, and exhibit stronger turnover-performance sensitivity than firms whose boards are only conventionally independent.

The role of institutional investors in seasoned equity offerings,"Do institutional investors possess private information about seasoned equity offerings (SEOs)? If so, do they use this private information to trade in a direction opposite to this information (a manipulative trading role) or in the same direction (an information production role)? We use a large sample of transaction-level institutional trading data to distinguish between these two roles of institutional investors. We explicitly identify institutional SEO allocations for the first time in the literature. We analyze the consequences of the private information possessed by institutional investors for SEO share allocation, institutional trading before and after the SEO and realized trading profitability, and the SEO discount. We find that institutions are able to identify and obtain more allocations in SEOs with better long-run stock returns, they trade in the same direction as their private information, and their post-SEO trading significantly outperforms a naive buy-and-hold trading strategy. Further, more pre-offer institutional net buying and larger institutional SEO allocations are associated with a smaller SEO discount. Overall, our results are consistent with institutions possessing private information about SEOs and with an information production instead of a manipulative trading role for institutional investors in SEOs.","['Thomas J.

Managerial risk-taking behavior and equity-based compensation,"Equity-based compensation affects managers’ risk-taking behavior, which in turn has an impact on shareholder wealth. In response to an exogenous increase in takeover protection in Delaware during the mid-1990s, managers lower firm risk by 6%. This risk reduction is concentrated among firms with low managerial equity-based incentives, in particular firms with low chief executive officer portfolio sensitivity to stock return volatility. Furthermore, the risk reduction is value-destroying. Finally, firms respond to the increased protection accorded by the regime shift by providing managers with greater incentives for risk-taking.",['Angie Low'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000245,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,3,Angie Low,2009,169.04555647674368
Seasoned equity offerings: Quality of accounting information and expected flotation costs,"Flotation costs represent a significant loss of capital to firms and are positively related to information asymmetry between managers and outside investors. We measure a firm's information asymmetry by its accounting information quality based on two extensions of the Dechow and Dichev [2002. The quality of accruals and earnings: the role of accrual estimation errors. Accounting Review 77, 35–59] earnings accruals model, which is a more direct approach to assessing the information available to outside investors than the more commonly used proxies. Our main hypothesis is that poor accounting information quality raises uncertainty about a firm's financial condition for outside investors, though not necessarily for insiders. This accounting effect lowers demand for a firm's new equity, thereby raising underwriting costs and risk. Using a large sample of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), we show that poor accounting information quality is associated with higher flotation costs in terms of larger underwriting fees, larger negative SEO announcement effects, and a higher probability of SEO withdrawals. These results are robust to joint determination of offer size and flotation cost components and to adjustments for sample selection bias.","['Gemma Lee', 'Ronald W.

Managerial ownership dynamics and firm value,"From 1988 to 2003, the average change in managerial ownership is significantly negative every year for American firms. We find that managers are more likely to significantly decrease their ownership when their firms are performing well and more likely to increase their ownership when their firms become financially constrained. When controlling for past stock returns, we find that large increases in managerial ownership increase Tobin's q. This result is driven by increases in shares held by officers, while increases in shares held by directors appear unrelated to changes in firm value. There is no evidence that large decreases in ownership have an adverse impact on firm value. We rely on the dynamics of the managerial ownership/firm value relation to mitigate concerns in the literature about the endogeneity of managerial ownership.","['Rüdiger Fahlenbrach', 'René M.

The market for corporate control and the cost of debt,"How do bondholders view the existence of an open market for corporate control? Between 1985 and 1991, 30 states in the U.S. enacted business combination (BC) laws, raising the cost of corporate takeovers. Relying on these exogenous events, we estimate the influence of the market for corporate control on the cost of debt. We identify different channels through which an open market for corporate control can benefit or harm bondholders: a reduction in managerial slack or the “quiet life,” resulting in higher profitability and firm value; a coinsurance effect, in which firms become less risky after being acquired; and an increasing leverage effect, in which bondholder wealth is expropriated through leverage-increasing takeovers. Consistent with the first two mechanisms, we find that the cost of debt rose after the passage of the BC laws; moreover, it rose sharply for firms in non-competitive industries, and for firms rated speculative-grade. In contrast, there is virtually no effect for firms in competitive industries, or firms rated investment-grade.","['Jiaping Qiu', 'Fan Yu']","['Cost of debt', 'Credit spread', 'Market for corporate control', 'Business combination laws']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000981,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,3,Jiaping Qiu,2009,169.04555647674368

While firms’ ex ante yield spread can partially predict the direction of refinement changes, firms with refinement upgrades experience an additional decrease in their ex post borrowing cost compared with firms with downgrades. The former subsequently also issue more debt and rely more on debt financing over equity than the latter.

Do firms have leverage targets? Evidence from acquisitions,"In the context of large acquisitions, we provide evidence on whether firms have target capital structures. We examine how deviations from these targets affect how bidders choose to finance acquisitions and how they adjust their capital structure following the acquisitions. We show that when a bidder's leverage is over its target level, it is less likely to finance the acquisition with debt and more likely to finance the acquisition with equity. Also, we find a positive association between the merger-induced changes in target and actual leverage, and we show that bidders incorporate more than two-thirds of the change to the merged firm's new target leverage. Following debt-financed acquisitions, managers actively move the firm back to its target leverage, reversing more than 75% of the acquisition's leverage effect within five years. Overall, our results are consistent with a model of capital structure that includes a target level and adjustment costs.","['Jarrad Harford', 'Sandy Klasa', 'Nathan Walcott']","['Capital structure', 'Leverage targets', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Trade-off theory']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000622,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,1,Jarrad Harford,2009,169.04555647674368

When uncertainty exists about predictability, which is likely in practice, the fixed allocation rules combined with technical analysis can outperform the prior-dependent optimal learning rule when the prior is not too informative. Moreover, the technical trading rules are robust to model specification, and they tend to substantially outperform the model-based optimal trading strategies when the model governing the stock price is uncertain.","['Yingzi Zhu', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Technical analysis', 'Trading rules', 'Asset allocation', 'Predictability', 'Learning']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000361,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,3,Yingzi Zhu,2009,169.04555647674368
A market-clearing role for inefficiency on a limit order book,"Limit order markets with stationary dynamics attract equal volumes of market orders and uncanceled limit orders, equalizing the supply and demand for liquidity and immediacy. To maintain this balance, market orders must share any benefit obtained by limit order traders from more efficient trading conditions, such as better order queuing policies. Therefore an efficient market places a low price on immediacy, producing small bid–ask spreads. Furthermore, when price-discreteness leads to a mainly constant spread, cutting the price tick raises surplus. This is modeled with a stochastic sequential game, using stationarity considerations to bypass direct analysis of traders’ intricate market forecasts.",['Jeremy Large'],"['Stochastic sequential game', 'Stationary equilibrium', 'Limit order book', 'Market depths', 'Bid–ask spread']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001451,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,1,Jeremy Large,2009,169.04555647674368

We infer daily institutional trading behavior from the “tape”, the Transactions and Quotes database of the New York Stock Exchange, using a sophisticated method that best predicts quarterly 13-F data from trades of different sizes. We find that daily institutional trades are highly persistent and respond positively to recent daily returns but negatively to longer-term past daily returns. Institutional trades, particularly sells, appear to generate short-term losses—possibly reflecting institutional demand for liquidity—but longer-term profits. One source of these profits is that institutions anticipate both earnings surprises and post-earnings announcement drift. These results are different from those obtained using a standard size cutoff rule for institutional trades.","['John Y.

Hidden liquidity: An analysis of order exposure strategies in electronic stock markets,"Many stock exchanges choose to reduce market transparency by allowing traders to hide some or all of their order size. We study the costs and benefits of order exposure and test hypotheses regarding hidden order usage using a sample of Euronext-Paris stocks, where hidden orders represent 44% of the sample order volume. Our results support the hypothesis that hidden orders are associated with a decreased probability of full execution and increased average time to completion, and fail to support the alternate hypothesis that order exposure causes defensive traders to withdraw from the market. However, exposing rather than hiding order size increases average execution costs. We assess the extent to which non-displayed size is truly hidden and document that the presence and magnitude of hidden orders can be predicted to a significant, but imperfect, degree based on observable order attributes, firm characteristics, and market conditions. Overall, the results indicate that the option to hide order size is valuable, in particular, to patient traders.","['Hendrik Bessembinder', 'Marios Panayides', 'Kumar Venkataraman']","['Limit order market', 'Trading strategies', 'Hidden liquidity', 'Dark pools', 'Iceberg orders']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001494,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,94,3,Hendrik Bessembinder,2009,169.04555647674368
Does investor recognition predict returns?,"Merton [1987. A simple model of capital market equilibrium with incomplete information. Journal of Finance 42, 483–510] shows that stocks about which not all investors are informed should yield a return premium. This premium depends on the shadow cost of incomplete information which in turn depends on the shareholder base, relative market size, and idiosyncratic risk. Utilizing a comprehensive database of Swedish shareholdings, we demonstrate that stock returns are positively related to the shadow cost. We also find that the shareholder base is negatively related to returns when controlling for size and idiosyncratic risk. Zero-cost portfolios based on the shadow cost/shareholder base yield substantial trading profits that are never positively correlated with the market and are only modestly explained by the four-factor model.","['Andriy Bodnaruk', 'Per Ostberg']","['Investor recognition', 'Incomplete information', 'Stock market participation']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001839,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,2,Andriy Bodnaruk,2009,169.04555647674368
"Sell on the news: Differences of opinion, short-sales constraints, and returns around earnings announcements","Miller [1977. Risk, uncertainty, and divergence of opinion. Journal of Finance 32, 1151–1168] hypothesizes that prices of stocks subject to high differences of opinion and short-sales constraints are biased upward. We expect earnings announcements to reduce differences of opinion among investors, and consequently, these announcements should reduce overvaluation. Using five distinct proxies for differences of opinion, we find that high differences of opinion stocks earn significantly lower returns around earnings announcements than low differences of opinion stocks. In addition, the returns on high differences of opinion stocks are more negative within the subsample of stocks that are most difficult for investors to sell short. These results are robust when we control for the size effect and the market-to-book effect and when we examine alternative explanations such as financial leverage, earnings announcement premium, post-earnings announcement drift, return momentum, and potential biases in analysts’ forecasts. Also consistent with Miller's theory, we find that stocks subject to high differences of opinion and more binding short-sales constraints have a price run-up just prior to earnings announcements that is followed by an even larger decline after the announcements.","['Henk Berkman', 'Valentin Dimitrov', 'Prem C.

Can interest rate volatility be extracted from the cross section of bond yields?,"Most affine models of the term structure with stochastic volatility predict that the variance of the short rate should play a ‘dual role’ in that it should also equal a linear combination of yields. However, we find that estimation of a standard affine three-factor model results in a variance state variable that, while instrumental in explaining the shape of the yield curve, is essentially unrelated to GARCH estimates of the quadratic variation of the spot rate process or to implied variances from options. We then investigate four-factor affine models. Of the models tested, only the model that exhibits ‘unspanned stochastic volatility’ (USV) generates both realistic short rate volatility estimates and a good cross-sectional fit. Our findings suggest that short rate volatility cannot be extracted from the cross-section of bond prices. In particular, short rate volatility and convexity are only weakly correlated.","['Pierre Collin-Dufresne', 'Robert S. Goldstein', 'Christopher S.

Options trading activity and firm valuation,"Options may have an effect on firm value because they help complete markets and stimulate informed trades. However, these benefits are likely to manifest themselves in active, rather than inactive, options markets. Supporting this observation, we find that firms with more options trading have higher values of Tobin's q, after accounting for other determinants of value. Corporate investment in firms with greater options trading is more sensitive to stock prices. Options trading affects firm valuation more strongly in stocks with greater information asymmetry. These results indicate that options trading is positively associated with firm values as well as information production.","['Richard Roll', 'Eduardo Schwartz', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam']","['Options markets', ""Tobin's q"", 'Trading volume']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001470,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,94,3,Richard Roll,2009,169.04555647674368
Are fairness opinions fair? The case of mergers and acquisitions,"Over the period 1994–2003, 80% of targets and 37% of acquirers obtain a third-party assessment of the fairness of a merger or acquisition. These fairness opinions do not affect deal outcomes when used by targets, but they affect deal outcomes when used by acquirers. The deal premium is lower in transactions if the acquirer obtains a fairness opinion, and is further reduced if multiple advisors provide an opinion. However, the acquirer's announcement-period return is 2.3% lower if the acquirer has a fairness opinion, especially if the acquirer pays a high premium, indicating that investors are skeptical of these transactions.","['Darren J.

Why is PIN priced?,"Recent empirical work suggests that a proxy for the probability of informed trading (PIN) is an important determinant of the cross-section of average returns. This paper examines whether PIN is priced because of information asymmetry or because of other liquidity effects that are unrelated to information asymmetry. Our starting point is a model that decomposes PIN into two components, one related to asymmetric information and one related to illiquidity. In a two-pass Fama-MacBeth [1973. Risk, return, and equilibrium: empirical tests. Journal of Political Economy 81, 607–636] regression, we show that the PIN component related to asymmetric information is not priced, while the PIN component related to illiquidity is priced. We conclude, therefore, that liquidity effects unrelated to information asymmetry explain the relation between PIN and the cross-section of expected returns.","['Jefferson Duarte', 'Lance Young']","['Liquidity', 'Information asymmetry']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001827,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,2,Jefferson Duarte,2009,169.04555647674368
Investor activism and takeovers,"Recent work documents large positive abnormal returns when a hedge fund announces activist intentions regarding a publicly listed firm. We show that these returns are largely explained by the ability of activists to force target firms into a takeover. For a comprehensive sample of 13D filings by portfolio investors between 1993 and 2006, announcement returns and long-term abnormal returns are high for targets that are ultimately acquired, but not detectably different from zero for firms that remain independent. Firms targeted by activists are more likely than control firms to get acquired. Finally, activist investors’ portfolios perform poorly during a period in which market wide takeover interest declined.","['Robin Greenwood', 'Michael Schor']","['Investor activism', 'Event studies', 'Hedge funds', 'Corporate control']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000397,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,3,Robin Greenwood,2009,169.04555647674368
Predatory mortgage lending,"Regulators express growing concern over predatory loans, which we take to mean loans that borrowers should decline. Using a model of consumer credit in which such lending is possible, we identify the circumstances in which it arises both with and without competition. We find that predatory lending is associated with highly collateralized loans, inefficient refinancing of subprime loans, lending without due regard to ability to pay, prepayment penalties, balloon payments, and poorly informed borrowers. Under most circumstances competition among lenders attenuates predatory lending. We use our model to analyze the effects of legislative interventions.","['Philip Bond', 'David K.

Share issuance and cross-sectional returns: International evidence,"Share issuance predicts cross-sectional returns in a non-U.S. sample of stocks from 41 different countries. Issuance predictability has greater statistical significance than either size or momentum, and is similar to book-to-market. As in the U.S., the international issuance effect is robust across both small and large firms. Unlike the U.S., the effect is driven more by low returns after share creation rather than positive returns following share repurchases. Issuance return predictability is stronger in countries with greater issuance activity, greater stock market development, and stronger investor protection. The results suggest that the share issuance effect is related to the ease with which firms can issue and repurchase their shares.","['R.

Synchronicity and firm interlocks in an emerging market,"Stock price synchronicity has been attributed to poor corporate governance and a lack of firm-level transparency. This paper investigates the association between different kinds of firm interlocks, control groups, and synchronicity in Chile. A unique data set containing equity cross-holdings, common individual owners, and director interlocks is used to map out firm ties and control groups. While there is a correlation between synchronicity and share ownership and equity ties, synchronicity is more strongly correlated with interlocking directorates. The presence of share directors is associated with either reduced firm-level transparency or increased correlation in firm fundamentals—due, for example, to joint resource allocation across the firms.","['Tarun Khanna', 'Catherine Thomas']","['Information and market efficiency', 'International financial markets', 'Latin America']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08002079,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,2,Tarun Khanna,2009,169.04555647674368
High idiosyncratic volatility and low returns: International and further U.S. evidence,"Stocks with recent past high idiosyncratic volatility have low future average returns around the world. Across 23 developed markets, the difference in average returns between the extreme quintile portfolios sorted on idiosyncratic volatility is -1.31% per month, after controlling for world market, size, and value factors. The effect is individually significant in each G7 country. In the United States, we rule out explanations based on trading frictions, information dissemination, and higher moments. There is strong covariation in the low returns to high-idiosyncratic-volatility stocks across countries, suggesting that broad, not easily diversifiable factors lie behind this phenomenon.","['Andrew Ang', 'Robert J.

CEO pay and the Lake Wobegon Effect,"The “Lake Wobegon Effect,” which is widely cited as a potential cause for rising CEO pay, is said to occur because no firm wants to admit to having a CEO who is below average, and so no firm allows its CEO's pay package to lag market expectations. We develop a game-theoretic model of this Effect. In our model, a CEO's wage may serve as a signal of match surplus, and therefore affect the value of the firm. We compare equilibria of our model to a full-information case and derive conditions under which equilibrium wages are distorted upward.","['Rachel M.

Payout policy and cash-flow uncertainty,"The importance of cash-flow uncertainty in payout policy has received little attention in empirical studies, while survey studies such as [Lintner, J., 1956. Distribution of incomes of operations among dividends, retained earnings, and taxes. American Economic Review 46, 97–113.] and [Brav, A., Graham, J., Harvey C., Michaely, R., 2005. Payout policy in the 21st century. Journal of Financial Economics 77, 483–527.] indicate its importance. With worldwide firm-level data, we present evidence that cash-flow uncertainty is an important cross-sectional determinant of corporate payout policy. Our results show that across countries, cash-flow uncertainty, as proxied by stock return volatility, has a negative impact on the amount of dividends as well as the probability of paying dividends. The impact of cash-flow uncertainty on dividends is generally stronger than the impact of other potential determinants of payout policy—such as the earned/contributed capital mix, agency conflicts, and investment opportunities. We also find that the effect of cash-flow uncertainty on dividends is distinct from the effect of a firm's financial life-cycle stage.","['J.B.

City size and fund performance,"The literature predicts that the average skill level and productivity are higher in larger cities. Prior studies use workers’ wage or education differentials to indirectly link city size and output. This article relates city size and productivity directly, using performance data of U.S. equity mutual funds. On average, funds in financial centers perform better than other funds in terms of both gross and risk-adjusted returns, but this difference is driven only by more experienced managers. Among funds in financial centers there is strong evidence of a positive relation between performance and manager experience in a given city, especially among New York funds. More importantly, we observe performance improvements of the same manager at the same fund in financial centers but not elsewhere. Our tests provide novel evidence of knowledge spillovers and learning in cities.","['Susan E.K.

"Cashflow risk, systematic earnings revisions, and the cross-section of stock returns","The returns of stocks are partially driven by changes in their expected cashflow. Using revisions in analyst earnings forecasts, we construct an analyst earnings beta that measures the covariance between the cashflow innovations of an asset and those of the market. A higher analyst earnings beta implies greater sensitivity to marketwide revisions in expected cashflow, and therefore higher systematic risk. Our analyst earnings beta captures exposure to macroeconomic fluctuations and has a positive risk premium that provides a partial explanation for the value premium, size premium, and long-term return reversals. From 1984 to 2005, 55.1% of the return variation across book-to-market, size, and long-term return reversal portfolios is captured by their analyst earnings betas.","['Zhi Da', 'Mitchell Craig Warachka']","['Cashflow risk', 'Analyst forecast revisions']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0900141X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,94,3,Zhi Da,2009,169.04555647674368
Merger negotiations and the toehold puzzle,"The substantial control premium typically observed in corporate takeovers makes a compelling case for acquiring target shares (a toehold) in the market prior to launching a bid. Moreover, auction theory suggests that toehold bidding may yield a competitive advantage over rival bidders. Nevertheless, with a sample exceeding 10,000 initial control bids for US public targets, we show that toehold bidding has declined steadily since the early 1980s and is now surprisingly rare. At the same time, the average toehold is large when it occurs (20%), and toeholds are the norm in hostile bids. To explain these puzzling observations, we develop and test a two-stage takeover model where attempted merger negotiations are followed by open auction. With optimal bidding, a toehold imposes a cost on target management, causing some targets to (rationally) reject merger negotiations. Optimal toeholds are therefore either zero (to avoid rejection costs) or greater than a threshold (so that toehold benefits offset rejection costs). The toehold threshold estimate averages 9% across initial bidders, reflecting in part the bidder's opportunity loss of a merger termination agreement. In the presence of market liquidity costs, a threshold of this size may well induce a broad range of bidders to select zero toehold. As predicted, the probability of toehold bidding decreases, and the toehold size increases, with the threshold estimate. The model also predicts a relatively high frequency of toehold bidding in hostile bids, as observed. Overall, our test results are consistent with rational bidder behavior with respect to the toehold decision.","['Sandra Betton', 'B. Espen Eckbo', 'Karin S.

Idiosyncratic risk and the cross-section of expected stock returns,"Theories such as Merton [1987. A simple model of capital market equilibrium with incomplete information.

I show that idiosyncratic volatilities are time-varying and thus, their findings should not be used to imply the relation between idiosyncratic risk and expected return. Using the exponential GARCH models to estimate expected idiosyncratic volatilities, I find a significantly positive relation between the estimated conditional idiosyncratic volatilities and expected returns.

Do banks price their informational monopoly?,"Theory suggests that banks’ private information lets them hold up borrowers for higher interest rates. Since new information about a firm is revealed at the time of its bond IPO, it follows that banks will be forced to adjust their loan interest rates downwards after firms undertake their bond IPO. We test this hypothesis and find that firms are able to borrow at lower interest rates after their bond IPO. Importantly, firms that get their first credit rating at the time of their bond IPO benefit from larger interest rate savings than those that already had a credit rating. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that banks price their informational monopoly. We also find that it is costly for firms to enter the public bond market.","['Galina Hale', 'João A.C.

Strategic price complexity in retail financial markets,"There is mounting empirical evidence to suggest that the law of one price is violated in retail financial markets: there is significant price dispersion even when products are homogeneous. Also, despite the large number of firms in the market, prices remain above marginal cost and may even rise as more firms enter. In a non-cooperative oligopoly pricing model, I show that these anomalies arise when firms add complexity to their price structures. Complexity increases the market power of the firms because it prevents some consumers from becoming knowledgeable about prices in the market. In the model, as competition increases, firms tend to add more complexity to their prices as a best response, rather than make their disclosures more transparent. Because this may substantially decrease consumer surplus in these markets, such practices have important welfare implications.",['Bruce I.

"Capital expenditures, financial constraints, and the use of options","This paper analyzes why gold mining firms use options instead of linear strategies to hedge their gold price risk. Consistent with financial constraints based theories, the largest and least financially constrained firms are the most likely to hedge with insurance strategies (put options), while more constrained firms finance the purchase of puts by selling calls (collars). The most financially constrained firms use strategies that involve selling calls. Firms with large investment programs are also more likely to use insurance rather than linear strategies. Firms’ hedging instrument choices are also correlated with current market conditions, suggesting that managers’ market views partially drive hedging instrument choices.",['Tim Adam'],"['Risk management', 'Hedging', 'Insurance', 'Instrument choice', 'Speculation']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0900004X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,2,Tim Adam,2009,169.04555647674368
"Bank governance, regulation and risk taking","This paper conducts the first empirical assessment of theories concerning risk taking by banks, their ownership structures, and national bank regulations. We focus on conflicts between bank managers and owners over risk, and we show that bank risk taking varies positively with the comparative power of shareholders within the corporate governance structure of each bank. Moreover, we show that the relation between bank risk and capital regulations, deposit insurance policies, and restrictions on bank activities depends critically on each bank's ownership structure, such that the actual sign of the marginal effect of regulation on risk varies with ownership concentration. These findings show that the same regulation has different effects on bank risk taking depending on the bank's corporate governance structure.","['Luc Laeven', 'Ross Levine']","['Corporate governance', 'Bank regulation', 'Financial institutions', 'Financial risk']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000816,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,2,Luc Laeven,2009,169.04555647674368
Asymmetric information effects on loan spreads,"This paper estimates the cost arising from information asymmetry between the lead bank and members of the lending syndicate. In a lending syndicate, the lead bank retains only a fraction of the loan but acts as the intermediary between the borrower and the syndicate participants. Theory predicts that asymmetric information will cause participants to demand a higher interest rate and that a large loan ownership by the lead bank should reduce this effect. In equilibrium, however, the asymmetric information premium demanded by participants is offset by the diversification premium demanded by the lead. Using shifts in the idiosyncratic credit risk of the lead bank's loan portfolio as an instrument, I measure the asymmetric information effect of the lead's share on the loan spread and find that it accounts for approximately 4% of the total cost of credit.",['Victoria Ivashina'],"['Information asymmetry', 'Syndicated loans', 'Cost of capital']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000208,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,2,Victoria Ivashina,2009,169.04555647674368
Cost of capital effects and changes in growth expectations around U.S. cross-listings,"This paper examines whether cross-listing in the U.S. reduces firms’ costs of capital. We estimate cost of capital effects implied by market prices and analyst forecasts, which accounts for changes in growth expectations around cross-listings. Firms with cross-listings on U.S. exchanges experience a decrease in their cost of capital between 70 and 120 basis points. These effects are sustained and exist after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We find smaller reductions for cross-listings in the over-the-counter market and for exchange-listings from countries with stronger legal institutions. For exchange-traded cross-listings, the cost of capital reduction accounts for over half of the increase in firm value, whereas for other types of cross-listings the valuation effects are primarily attributable to contemporaneous revisions in growth expectations.","['Luzi Hail', 'Christian Leuz']","['Corporate governance', 'Bonding hypothesis', 'Cost of equity', 'Law and finance', 'International finance']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000841,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,3,Luzi Hail,2009,169.04555647674368
"Accruals, cash flows, and aggregate stock returns","This paper examines whether the firm-level accrual and cash flow effects extend to the aggregate stock market. In sharp contrast to previous firm-level findings, aggregate accruals is a strong positive time series predictor of aggregate stock returns, and cash flows is a negative predictor. In addition, innovations in accruals are negatively contemporaneously correlated with aggregate returns, and innovations in cash flows are positively correlated with returns. These findings suggest that innovations in accruals and cash flows contain information about changes in discount rates, or that firms manage earnings in response to marketwide undervaluation.","['David Hirshleifer', 'Kewei Hou', 'Siew Hong Teoh']","['Aggregate stock returns', 'Accruals', 'Cash flows', 'Discount rates', 'Behavioral finance']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08002006,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,3,David Hirshleifer,2009,169.04555647674368
Affiliated mutual funds and analyst optimism,"This paper extends the literature on analyst optimism. Our analysis of a large sample of recommendations issued from 1995 through 2006 indicates that sell-side analysts are likely to assign frequent and favorable ratings to a stock after the analysts’ affiliated mutual funds invest in that stock. Controlling for a number of variables, including the ties between analysts and investment banks, we find that the greater the portfolio weight of a stock in the fund family, the more optimistic the stock ratings from affiliated analysts become. Since 2002, analysts’ optimism on stocks held by affiliated mutual funds has declined. However, an analyst's decision of upgrading a stock to a “strong buy” rating is still significantly associated with the portfolio weight of that stock in the fund family.","['Simona Mola', 'Massimo Guidolin']","['Analyst coverage', 'Analyst optimism', 'Ratings', 'Mutual funds']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000403,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,1,Simona Mola,2009,169.04555647674368
Stock market liquidity and firm value,"This paper investigates the relation between stock liquidity and firm performance. The study shows that firms with liquid stocks have better performance as measured by the firm market-to-book ratio. This result is robust to the inclusion of industry or firm fixed effects, a control for idiosyncratic risk, a control for endogenous liquidity using two-stage least squares, and the use of alternative measures of liquidity. To identify the causal effect of liquidity on firm performance, we study an exogenous shock to liquidity—the decimalization of stock trading—and show that the increase in liquidity around decimalization improves firm performance. The causes of liquidity's beneficial effect are investigated: Liquidity increases the information content of market prices and of performance-sensitive managerial compensation. Finally, momentum trading, analyst coverage, investor overreaction, and the effect of liquidity on discount rates or expected returns do not appear to drive the results.","['Vivian W.

Early-stage financing and firm growth in new industries,"This paper shows that active investors, such as venture capitalists, can affect the speed at which new ventures grow. In the absence of product market competition, new ventures financed by active investors grow faster initially, though in the long run those financed by passive investors are able to catch up. By contrast, in a competitive product market, new ventures financed by active investors may prey on rivals that are financed by passive investors by “strategically overinvesting” early on, resulting in long-run differences in investment, profits, and firm growth. The value of active investors is greater in highly competitive industries as well as in industries with learning curves, economies of scope, and network effects, as is typical for many “new economy” industries. For such industries, our model predicts that start-ups with access to venture capital may dominate their industry peers in the long run.","['Roman Inderst', 'Holger M.

Dispersion in analysts’ earnings forecasts and credit rating,"This paper shows that the puzzling negative cross-sectional relation between dispersion in analysts’ earnings forecasts and future stock returns may be explained by financial distress, as proxied by credit rating downgrades. Focusing on a sample of firms rated by Standard & Poor's (S&P), we show that the profitability of dispersion-based trading strategies concentrates in a small number of the worst-rated firms and is significant only during periods of deteriorating credit conditions. In such periods, the negative dispersion–return relation emerges as low-rated firms experience substantial price drop along with considerable increase in forecast dispersion. Moreover, even for this small universe of worst-rated firms, the dispersion–return relation is non-existent when either the dispersion measure or return is adjusted by credit risk. The results are robust to previously proposed explanations for the dispersion effect such as short-sale constraints and leverage.","['Doron Avramov', 'Tarun Chordia', 'Gergana Jostova', 'Alexander Philipov']","['Credit rating', 'Dispersion', 'Asset pricing anomalies', 'Financial distress']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001840,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,1,Doron Avramov,2009,169.04555647674368
Global private information in international equity markets,"This paper studies international equity markets when some investors have private information that is valuable for trading in many countries simultaneously. We use a dynamic model of equity trading to show that global private information helps explain US investors’ trading behavior and performance. In particular, the model predicts global return chasing (positive co-movement of US investors’ net purchases with returns in many countries) which we show to be present in the data. Return chasing in our model can be due to superior performance of US investors, not inferior knowledge or naive trend-following. We also show that trades due to private information are strongly correlated across countries. A common (global) factor accounts for about half their variation.","['Rui Albuquerque', 'Gregory H.

Predictability and the earnings–returns relation,"This paper studies the effects of predictability on the earnings–returns relation for individual firms and for the aggregate. We demonstrate that prices better anticipate earnings growth at the aggregate level than at the firm level, which implies that random-walk models are inappropriate for gauging aggregate earnings expectations. Moreover, we show that the contemporaneous correlation of earnings growth and stock returns decreases with the ability to predict future earnings. Our results may therefore help explain the apparently conflicting recent evidence that the earnings–returns relation is negative at the aggregate level but positive at the firm level.","['Gil Sadka', 'Ronnie Sadka']","['Stock prices', 'Aggregate earnings', 'Discount rates', 'Expected returns', 'Expected earnings']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001068,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,94,1,Gil Sadka,2009,169.04555647674368
Individual investor mutual fund flows,"This paper studies the relation between individuals’ mutual fund flows and fund characteristics, establishing three key results. First, consistent with tax motivations, individual investors are reluctant to sell mutual funds that have appreciated in value and are willing to sell losing funds. Second, individuals pay attention to investment costs as redemption decisions are sensitive to both expense ratios and loads. Third, individuals’ fund-level inflows and outflows are sensitive to performance, but in different ways. Inflows are related only to “relative” performance, suggesting that new money chases the best performers in an objective. Outflows are related only to “absolute” fund performance, the relevant benchmark for taxes.","['Zoran Ivković', 'Scott Weisbenner']","['Mutual fund flows', 'Individual investor portfolio choice', 'Tax-motivated trading']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000051,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,2,Zoran Ivković,2009,169.04555647674368
Option markets and implied volatility: Past versus present,"Traders in the nineteenth century appear to have priced options the same way that twenty-first-century traders price options. Empirical regularities relating implied volatility to realized volatility, stock prices, and other implied volatilities (including the volatility skew) are qualitatively the same in both eras. Modern pricing models and centralized exchanges have not fundamentally altered pricing behavior, but they have generated increased trading volume and a much closer conformity in the level of observed and model prices. The major change in pricing is the sharp decline in implied volatility relative to realized volatility, evident immediately upon the opening of the CBOE.",['Scott Mixon'],"['Options', 'Implied volatility']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001238,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,94,2,Scott Mixon,2009,169.04555647674368
Renegotiation of financial contracts: Evidence from private credit agreements,"Using a large sample of private credit agreements between U.S. publicly traded firms and financial institutions, we show that over 90% of long-term debt contracts are renegotiated prior to their stated maturity. Renegotiations result in large changes to the amount, maturity, and pricing of the contract, occur relatively early in the life of the contract, and are rarely a consequence of distress or default. The accrual of new information concerning the credit quality, investment opportunities, and collateral of the borrower, as well as macroeconomic fluctuations in credit and equity market conditions, are the primary determinants of renegotiation and its outcomes. The terms of the initial contract (e.g., contingencies) also play an important role in renegotiations; by altering the structure of the contract in a state contingent manner, renegotiation is partially controlled by the contractual assignment of bargaining power.","['Michael R. Roberts', 'Amir Sufi']","['Renegotiation', 'Bargaining', 'Financial contracting']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000798,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,2,Michael R.

Dynamic order submission strategies with competition between a dealer market and a crossing network,"We analyze a dynamic microstructure model in which a dealer market (DM) and a crossing network (CN) interact for three informational settings. A key result is that coexistence of trading systems generates systematic patterns in order flow, which depend on the degree of transparency. Further, we study overall welfare, measured by the gains from trade of all agents, and compare it with the maximum overall welfare. The discrepancy between both measures is attributable to two inefficiencies. Due to these inefficiencies, introducing a CN next to a DM, as well as increasing the transparency level, not necessarily produces greater overall welfare.","['Hans Degryse', 'Mark Van Achter', 'Gunther Wuyts']","['Alternative trading systems', 'Crossing network', 'Order flow', 'Transparency', 'Welfare']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001864,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,3,Hans Degryse,2009,169.04555647674368
Product market advertising and new equity issues,"We analyze the interaction between a firm's product market advertising and its corporate financing decisions. We consider a firm that faces asymmetric information in both the product and financial markets and that needs to raise external financing to fund its growth opportunity (new project). Any product market advertising undertaken by the firm is visible to the financial market as well. In equilibrium, the firm uses a combination of product market advertising, equity underpricing, and underfinancing (raising a smaller amount of external capital than the full information optimum) to convey its true product quality and the intrinsic value of its projects to consumers and investors. The following two predictions arise from our theoretical analysis for the relation between product market advertising and equity underpricing around new equity issues. First, firms choose a higher level of product market advertising when they are planning to issue new equity, compared with situations in which they have no immediate plans to do so. Second, product market advertising and equity underpricing are substitutes for a firm issuing new equity. We empirically test the above two predictions and find supporting evidence in the context of firms making initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings.","['Thomas Chemmanur', 'An Yan']","['Advertising', 'Initial public offerings', 'Seasoned equity offerings', 'IPO underpricing']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001992,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,1,Thomas Chemmanur,2009,169.04555647674368
"Founders, heirs, and corporate opacity in the United States","We argue that information about firm activities can vary substantially in the presence of founder or heir ownership, thereby influencing the risks borne by minority investors. We explore two hypotheses with regard to these controlling shareholders and corporate transparency, focusing on their role as monitor in-place and their potential to exploit firm opacity to accrue private benefits of control. To test these notions, we create an opacity index that ranks the relative transparency of the two thousand largest industrial US firms and find founder and heir ownership in 22% and 25% of these firms, respectively. Our analysis indicates that, in large, publicly traded companies, both founder and heir firms are significantly more opaque than diffuse shareholder firms. We also find that founder and heir-controlled firms exhibit a negative relation to performance in all but the most transparent firms. Surprisingly, additional tests reveal that concerns about divergences in ownership versus control (management type, dual class shares, and board influence) appear to be substantially less important than corporate opacity in explaining the performance impacts of founder and heir control. Finally, we decompose corporate opacity into disclosure and market scrutiny components, finding that the disclosure quality component appears to be of greater importance to investors. However, irrespective of whether these controlling shareholders create or stay in the firm because of corporate opacity, our analysis suggests that founders and heirs in large, publicly traded firms exploit opacity to extract private benefits at the expense of minority investors.","['Ronald C.

Informed traders and limit order markets,"We consider a dynamic limit order market in which traders optimally choose whether to acquire information about the asset and the type of order to submit. We numerically solve for the equilibrium and demonstrate that the market is a “volatility multiplier”: prices are more volatile than the fundamental value of the asset. This effect increases when the fundamental value has high volatility and with asymmetric information across traders. Changes in the microstructure noise are negatively correlated with changes in the estimated fundamental value, implying that asset betas estimated from high-frequency data will be incorrect.","['Ronald L.

Hedging and competition,"We consider firms that, all else equal, wish to minimize variability in their internal capital (due to convex costs of raising external funds). The firms can hedge the cash flow risk of the project, but not that of winning or losing the auction. We characterize optimal hedging and bidding strategies in this competition framework. We show that access to financial markets makes firms bid more aggressively, possibly even above their valuation for the project. In addition, hedging increases the variance of bids and makes firm values more dispersed. Further, with hedging, the covariance of internal capital changes with the risk factor is negative, and is more negative, the higher the correlation of the hedging instrument with the risk factor.","['Tingjun Liu', 'Christine A.

Liquidity risk and syndicate structure,"We decompose syndicated loan risk into credit, market, and liquidity risk and test how these shape syndicate structure. Commercial banks dominate relative to non-banks in loan syndicates that expose lenders to liquidity risk. This dominance is most pronounced when borrowers have high levels of credit or market risk. We then tie commercial banks’ advantage in liquidity risk to access to transactions deposits by comparing investments across banks. The results suggest that risk-management considerations matter most for participants relative to lead arrangers. Links from transactions deposits to liquidity exposure, for instance, are more than 50% larger at participants than at lead arrangers.","['Evan Gatev', 'Philip E.

"Risk sharing, finance, and institutions in international portfolios","We develop a standard model to show how transaction costs in international investment affect conventional tests of consumption risk sharing, both in a multilateral and a bilateral setting. We implement the tests in a novel international data set on bilateral holdings of equity, bonds, foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. In our data, high foreign capital holdings are associated with international consumption risk sharing as implied by our theory. This is especially true of investment in equity or bonds, but not of foreign direct investment or bank loans. In our model, the implication is that transaction costs are higher for FDI and international loans. The discrepancy could reflect technological differences, but also the prospect of expropriation, perhaps most stringent for FDI or loans. We argue that expropriation risk is endogenous to both the borrower's institutions and its openness to international markets. The detrimental impact of poor institutions is muted in open economies, where the possibility of subsequent exclusion from world markets deters expropriation of foreign capital. We show the implied effects of institutions prevail in both the cross-section of consumption risk sharing and in observed international investment patterns.","['Marcel Fratzscher', 'Jean Imbs']","['Risk sharing', 'Diversification', 'Portfolio choice', 'Financial integration', 'Cross-border investment']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0900124X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,94,3,Marcel Fratzscher,2009,169.04555647674368
The underpricing of private targets,"We examine acquisitions of private firms with valuation histories and find a positive relation between acquirer announcement returns and target valuation revisions. Similar to other studies, acquirer announcement returns are positive, on average. However, positive acquirer announcement returns are mainly driven by targets that are acquired for more than their prior valuation. This relation is consistent with pricing effects associated with target valuation uncertainty and behavioral biases in negotiation outcomes.","['John W.

"Democratizing entry: Banking deregulations, financing constraints, and entrepreneurship","We examine entrepreneurship and creative destruction following US banking deregulations using US Census Bureau data. US banking reforms brought about exceptional growth in both entrepreneurship and business closures. Most of the closures, however, were the new ventures themselves. Although we find evidence for the standard story of creative destruction, the most pronounced impact was a massive increase in churning among new entrants. We argue that creative destruction requires many business failures along with the few great successes. The successes are difficult to identify ex ante, which is why democratizing entry is an important trait of well-functioning capital markets.","['William R.

We show that debt tranches that are secured by more redeployable collateral exhibit lower credit spreads, higher credit ratings, and higher loan-to-value ratios—an effect which our estimates show to be economically sizeable. Our results suggest that the ability to pledge collateral, and in particular redeployable collateral, lowers the cost of external financing and increases debt capacity.","['Efraim Benmelech', 'Nittai K.

Does religion matter in corporate decision making in America?,"We examine how corporate culture influences firm behavior. Prior research suggests a link between individual religiosity and risk aversion. We find that this relationship also influences organizational behavior. Firms located in counties with higher levels of religiosity display lower degrees of risk exposure, as measured by variances in equity returns or returns on assets. They exhibit a lower investment rate and less growth, but generate a more positive market reaction, when they announce new investments. Finally, chief executive officers are more likely to join a firm with a similar religious environment as in their previous firm when they switch employers.","['Gilles Hilary', 'Kai Wai Hui']","['Corporate investment', 'Risk aversion', 'Corporate culture', 'Religion']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0900083X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,3,Gilles Hilary,2009,169.04555647674368
"Debt, bargaining, and credibility in firm–supplier relationships","We examine optimal leverage for a downstream firm relying on implicit (self-enforcing) contracts with a supplier. Performing a leveraged recapitalization prior to bargaining increases the firm's share of total surplus. However, the resulting debt overhang limits the range of credible bonuses, resulting in low input quality. Optimal financial structure trades off bargaining benefits of debt with inefficiency resulting from overhang. Consistent with empirical evidence, the model predicts that leverage increases with supplier bargaining power (e.g., unionization rates) and decreases with utilization of non-verifiable inputs (e.g., human capital).","['Christopher A.

"Employment risk, compensation incentives, and managerial risk taking: Evidence from the mutual fund industry","We examine the influence on managerial risk taking of incentives due to employment risk and due to compensation. Our empirical investigation of the risk taking behavior of mutual fund managers indicates that managerial risk taking crucially depends on the relative importance of these incentives. When employment risk is more important than compensation incentives, fund managers with a poor midyear performance tend to decrease risk relative to leading managers to prevent potential job loss. When employment risk is low, compensation incentives become more relevant and fund managers with a poor midyear performance increase risk to catch up with the midyear winners.","['Alexander Kempf', 'Stefan Ruenzi', 'Tanja Thiele']","['Managerial risk taking', 'Employment risk', 'Compensation incentives', 'Mutual funds', 'Restrictions']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08002067,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,1,Alexander Kempf,2009,169.04555647674368

Neighborhood matters: The impact of location on broad based stock option plans,We find that fixed effects related to the location of firms’ headquarters explain variation in broad based option grants after controlling for industry effects and firm characteristics traditionally known to affect option granting. Location matters because of local labor market conditions and social interaction with neighboring firms. Broad based option grants are higher: (i) when a firm's stock prices co-move more with stock prices of other firms located in that Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA); (ii) in states that are less likely to enforce non-compete agreements; and (iii) in MSAs where employees prefer options because stocks there experience abnormally high returns.,"['Simi Kedia', 'Shiva Rajgopal']","['Geography', 'Stock options', 'Location', 'Employee compensation', 'Retention']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08002110,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,1,Simi Kedia,2009,169.04555647674368
"Stock splits, trading continuity, and the cost of equity capital","We hypothesize that managers use stock splits to attract more uninformed trading so that market makers can provide liquidity services at lower costs, thereby increasing investors’ trading propensity and improving liquidity. We examine a large sample of stock splits and find that, consistent with our hypothesis, the incidence of no trading decreases and liquidity risk is lower following splits, implying a decline in latent trading costs and a reduced cost of equity capital. Further, split announcement returns are correlated with the improvements in both liquidity levels and liquidity risk.

Theoretically, we introduce persistent time-varying uncertainty about the fundamentals in an external habit model. The model matches the dynamics of dividend and consumption growth, including their volatility dynamics and many salient asset market phenomena. While the variation in price–dividend ratios and the equity risk premium is primarily driven by risk aversion, uncertainty plays a large role in the term structure and is the driver of countercyclical volatility of asset returns.","['Geert Bekaert', 'Eric Engstrom', 'Yuhang Xing']","['Equity premium', 'Economic uncertainty', 'Stochastic risk aversion', 'Time variation in risk and return', 'Excess volatility', 'External habit', 'Term structure', 'Heteroskedasticity']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001670,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,1,Geert Bekaert,2009,169.04555647674368
Redistribution by insurance market regulation: Analyzing a ban on gender-based retirement annuities,We illustrate how equilibrium screening models can be used to evaluate the economic consequences of insurance market regulation. We calibrate and solve a model of the United Kingdom's compulsory annuity market and examine the impact of gender-based pricing restrictions. We find that the endogenous adjustment of annuity contract menus in response to such restrictions can undo up to half of the redistribution from men to women that would occur with exogenous Social Security-like annuity contracts. Our findings indicate the importance of endogenous contract responses and illustrate the feasibility of employing theoretical insurance market equilibrium models for quantitative policy analysis.,"['Amy Finkelstein', 'James Poterba', 'Casey Rothschild']","['Insurance regulation', 'Annuities', 'Categorical discrimination', 'Gender-based pricing']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001530,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,1,Amy Finkelstein,2009,169.04555647674368
"Opaque financial reports, R2, and crash risk","We investigate the relation between the transparency of financial statements and the distribution of stock returns. Using earnings management as a measure of opacity, we find that opacity is associated with higher R2s, indicating less revelation of firm-specific information. Moreover, opaque firms are more prone to stock price crashes, consistent with the prediction of the Jin and Myers [2006. R2 around the world: new theory and new tests. Journal of Financial Economics 79, 257–292] model. However, these relations seem to have dissipated since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, suggesting that earnings management has decreased or that firms can hide less information in the new regulatory environment.","['Amy P.

Creditor control rights and firm investment policy,"We present novel empirical evidence that conflicts of interest between creditors and their borrowers have a significant impact on firm investment policy. We examine a large sample of private credit agreements between banks and public firms and find that 32% of the agreements contain an explicit restriction on the firm's capital expenditures. Creditors are more likely to impose a capital expenditure restriction as a borrower's credit quality deteriorates, and the use of a restriction appears at least as sensitive to borrower credit quality as other contractual terms, such as interest rates, collateral requirements, or the use of financial covenants. We find that capital expenditure restrictions cause a reduction in firm investment and that firms obtaining contracts with a new restriction experience subsequent increases in their market value and operating performance.","['Greg Nini', 'David C.

What drives volatility persistence in the foreign exchange market?,"We propose a new empirical specification of volatility that links volatility to the information flow, measured as the order flow in the market, and to the price sensitivity to that information. The time-varying market sensitivity to information is estimated from high-frequency data, and movements in volatility can therefore be directly related to movements in order flow and market sensitivity. Empirically, the model explains a large share of the long-run variation in volatility. Importantly, the time variation in the market's sensitivity to information is at least as relevant in explaining the persistence of volatility as the rate of information arrival itself. This may be evidence of a link between changes over time in the aggregate behavior of market participants and the time-series properties of realized volatility.","['David Berger', 'Alain Chaboud', 'Erik Hjalmarsson']","['Volatility persistence', 'High-frequency data', 'Realized volatility', 'Long memory', 'Exchange rates']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001196,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,94,2,David Berger,2009,169.04555647674368
The price of sin: The effects of social norms on markets,"We provide evidence for the effects of social norms on markets by studying “sin” stocks—publicly traded companies involved in producing alcohol, tobacco, and gaming. We hypothesize that there is a societal norm against funding operations that promote vice and that some investors, particularly institutions subject to norms, pay a financial cost in abstaining from these stocks. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that sin stocks are less held by norm-constrained institutions such as pension plans as compared to mutual or hedge funds that are natural arbitrageurs, and they receive less coverage from analysts than do stocks of otherwise comparable characteristics. Sin stocks also have higher expected returns than otherwise comparable stocks, consistent with them being neglected by norm-constrained investors and facing greater litigation risk heightened by social norms. Evidence from corporate financing decisions and the performance of sin stocks outside the US also suggest that norms affect stock prices and returns.","['Harrison Hong', 'Marcin Kacperczyk']","['Expected stock returns', 'Institutional ownership', 'Social norms', 'Sin stocks']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000634,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,1,Harrison Hong,2009,169.04555647674368
The strategic use of corporate cash holdings in collective bargaining with labor unions,"We provide evidence that firms in more unionized industries strategically hold less cash to gain bargaining advantages over labor unions and shelter corporate income from their demands. Specifically, we show that corporate cash holdings are negatively related with unionization. We also find that this relation is stronger for firms that are likely to place a higher value on gaining a bargaining advantage over unions and weaker for those firms in which lower cash holdings provide less credible evidence that a firm is unable to concede to union demands. Additionally, we show that for unionized firms increases in cash holdings raise the probability of a strike. Finally, we show that unionization decreases the market value of a dollar of cash holdings. Overall, our findings indicate that firms trade-off the benefits of corporate cash holdings with the costs resulting from a weaker bargaining position with labor.","['Sandy Klasa', 'William F.

"Dividend policy, creditor rights, and the agency costs of debt","We show that country-level creditor rights influence dividend policies around the world by establishing the balance of power between debt and equity claimants. Creditors demand and managers consent to a more restrictive payout policy as a substitute for weak creditor rights in an effort to minimize the firm's agency costs of debt. Using a sample of 120,507 firm-years from 52 countries, we find that both the probability and amount of dividend payouts are significantly lower in countries with poor creditor rights. A reduction in the creditor rights index from its highest value to its lowest value implies a 41% reduction in the probability of paying a dividend, and a 60% reduction in dividend payout ratios. These results are robust to numerous control variables, sample variations, model specifications, and alternative hypotheses. We also show that the agency costs of debt play a more decisive role in determining dividend policies than the previously documented agency costs of equity. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing literature arguing that creditors exert significant influence over corporate decision-making outside of bankruptcy.","['Paul Brockman', 'Emre Unlu']","['Creditor rights', 'Dividend policy', 'Agency costs']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000087,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,2,Paul Brockman,2009,169.04555647674368
Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance,"We show that female directors have a significant impact on board inputs and firm outcomes. In a sample of US firms, we find that female directors have better attendance records than male directors, male directors have fewer attendance problems the more gender-diverse the board is, and women are more likely to join monitoring committees. These results suggest that gender-diverse boards allocate more effort to monitoring. Accordingly, we find that chief executive officer turnover is more sensitive to stock performance and directors receive more equity-based compensation in firms with more gender-diverse boards. However, the average effect of gender diversity on firm performance is negative. This negative effect is driven by companies with fewer takeover defenses. Our results suggest that mandating gender quotas for directors can reduce firm value for well-governed firms.","['Renée B.

The impact of risk and uncertainty on expected returns,"We study asset pricing in economies featuring both risk and uncertainty. In our empirical analysis, we measure risk via return volatility and uncertainty via the degree of disagreement of professional forecasters, attributing different weights to each forecaster. We empirically model the typical risk-return trade-off and augment these models with our measure of uncertainty. We find stronger empirical evidence for an uncertainty-return trade-off than for the traditional risk-return trade-off. Finally, we investigate the performance of a two-factor model with risk and uncertainty in the cross section.","['Evan W. Anderson', 'Eric Ghysels', 'Jennifer L.

Mortgage timing,"We study how the term structure of interest rates relates to mortgage choice at both household and aggregate levels. A simple utility framework of mortgage choice points to the long-term bond risk premium as distinct from the yield spread and the long yield as a theoretical determinant of mortgage choice: when the bond risk premium is high, fixed-rate mortgage payments are high, making adjustable-rate mortgages more attractive. We confirm empirically that the bulk of the time variation in both aggregate and loan-level mortgage choice can be explained by time variation in the bond risk premium, whether bond risk premia are measured using forecasters’ data, a vector autoregressive (VAR) term structure model, or a simple household decision rule based on adaptive expectations. The household decision rule moves in lock-step with mortgage choice, lending credibility to a theory of strategic mortgage timing by households.","['Ralph S.J.

Conditional volatility in affine term-structure models: Evidence from Treasury and swap markets,"We study the ability of three-factor affine term-structure models to extract conditional volatility using interest rate swap yields for 1991–2005 and Treasury yields for 1970–2003. For the Treasury sample, the correlation between model-implied and EGARCH volatility is between 60% and 75%. For the swap sample, this correlation is rather low or negative. We find that these differences in model performance are primarily due to the timing of the swap sample, and not to institutional differences between swap and Treasury markets. We conclude that the ability of multifactor affine models to extract conditional volatility depends on the sample period, but that overall these models perform better than has been argued in the literature.","['Kris Jacobs', 'Lotfi Karoui']","['Term-structure model', 'Affine', 'Interest rate swap', 'Treasury market', 'Conditional volatility', 'Time series', 'Cross-section', 'EGARCH']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001852,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,91,3,Kris Jacobs,2009,169.04555647674368
Cross-section of option returns and volatility,"We study the cross-section of stock option returns by sorting stocks on the difference between historical realized volatility and at-the-money implied volatility. We find that a zero-cost trading strategy that is long (short) in the portfolio with a large positive (negative) difference between these two volatility measures produces an economically and statistically significant average monthly return. The results are robust to different market conditions, to stock risks-characteristics, to various industry groupings, to option liquidity characteristics, and are not explained by usual risk factor models.","['Amit Goyal', 'Alessio Saretto']","['Option returns', 'Historical volatility', 'Implied volatility', 'Overreaction']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09001251,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,94,2,Amit Goyal,2009,169.04555647674368
Has New York become less competitive than London in global markets? Evaluating foreign listing choices over time,"We study the determinants and consequences of cross-listings on the New York and London stock exchanges from 1990 to 2005. This investigation enables us to evaluate the relative benefits of New York and London exchange listings and to assess whether these relative benefits have changed over time, perhaps as a result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. We find that cross-listings have been falling on US exchanges as well as on the Main Market in London. This decline in cross-listings is explained by changes in firm characteristics instead of by changes in the benefits of cross-listing. We show that after controlling for firm characteristics there is no deficit in cross-listing counts on US exchanges related to SOX. Investigating the valuation differential between listed and non-listed firms (the cross-listing premium) from 1990 to 2005, we find that there is a significant premium for US exchange listings every year, that the premium has not fallen significantly in recent years, and that it persists when allowing for time-invariant unobservable firm characteristics. In contrast, no premium exists for listings on London's Main Market in any year. Firms increase their capital-raising activities at home and abroad following a cross-listing on a major US exchange but not following a cross-listing in London. Our evidence is consistent with the theory that an exchange listing in New York has unique governance benefits for foreign firms.","['Craig Doidge', 'G. Andrew Karolyi', 'René M.

Cosmetic mergers: The effect of style investing on the market for corporate control,"We study the impact of “style investing” on the market for corporate control. We argue that the choice of the bidder is influenced by the fact that the merge with a firm that belongs to an investment style more popular with the market may boost the bidder's value. By using data on the flows in mutual funds, we construct a measure of popularity, which relies directly on the identification of sentiment-induced investor demand, rather than being a direct transformation of stock market data. We show that differences in popularity between bidder and target help to explain their pairing. The merger with a more popular target generates a halo effect from the target to the bidder that induces the market to evaluate the assets of the less popular bidder at the (inflated) market value of the more popular target. Both bidder and target premiums are positively related to the difference in popularity between the target and the bidder. However, the target's ability to appropriate the gain is reduced by the fact that its bargaining position is weaker when the bidder's potential for asset appreciation is higher. We document a better short- and medium-term performance of less popular firms taking over more popular firms. The bidder managers engaging in these cosmetic mergers take advantage of the window of opportunity induced by the deal to reduce their stake in the firm under convenient conditions.","['Massimo Massa', 'Lei Zhang']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Popularity', 'Style investing', 'Short-termism', 'Mutual funds', 'Dumb money']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000828,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,3,Massimo Massa,2009,169.04555647674368
Are elite universities losing their competitive edge?,"We study the location-specific component of research productivity for economics and finance faculty over the last three decades. We find that there was a positive effect of being affiliated with a top 25 university in the 1970s; this effect weakened in the 1980s and disappeared in the 1990s. The decline in elite university fixed effect is due to the reduced importance of physical access to productive research colleagues, which in turn seems due to innovations in communication technology. One implication is that knowledge-based organizations should find it more difficult to capture rents vis-à-vis workers. We find that faculty salaries increased the most where the estimated spillover dropped the most. Despite the loss in local spillovers, elite universities still enjoy an edge in average productivity because of agglomeration of top researchers in prestigious institutions with high long-term research reputations.","['E.

The on-the-run liquidity phenomenon,"We test the implications of a model of multi-asset speculative trading in which liquidity differentials between on-the-run and off-the-run U.S. Treasury bonds ensue from endowment shocks in the presence of two realistic market frictions—information heterogeneity and imperfect competition among informed traders—and a public signal. Our evidence suggests that (i) off/on-the-run liquidity differentials are economically and statistically significant, even after controlling for several of the bonds’ intrinsic characteristics (such as duration, convexity, repo rates, or term premiums), and (ii) off/on-the-run liquidity differentials are smaller immediately following bond auction dates, and larger when the uncertainty surrounding the ensuing auction allocations is high, when the dispersion of beliefs across informed traders is high, and when macroeconomic announcements are noisy, consistent with our model.","['Paolo Pasquariello', 'Clara Vega']","['Treasury bond markets', 'Liquidity', 'On-the-run bonds', 'Off-the-run bonds', 'Macroeconomic news announcements']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08002080,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,92,1,Paolo Pasquariello,2009,169.04555647674368
Inexperienced investors and bubbles,"We use mutual fund manager data from the technology bubble to examine the hypothesis that inexperienced investors play a role in the formation of asset price bubbles. Using age as a proxy for managers’ investment experience, we find that around the peak of the technology bubble, mutual funds run by younger managers are more heavily invested in technology stocks, relative to their style benchmarks, than their older colleagues. Furthermore, young managers, but not old managers, exhibit trend-chasing behavior in their technology stock investments. As a result, young managers increase their technology holdings during the run-up, and decrease them during the downturn. Both results are in line with the behavior of inexperienced investors in experimental asset markets. The economic significance of young managers’ actions is amplified by large inflows into their funds prior to the peak in technology stock prices.","['Robin Greenwood', 'Stefan Nagel']","['Asset price bubbles', 'Investment experience', 'Investor age', 'Trend chasing']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X09000646,Journal of Financial Economics,0.3176104787500343,93,2,Robin Greenwood,2009,169.04555647674368
How and why do small firms manage interest rate risk?,"Although small firms are particularly sensitive to interest rates and other shocks, empirical work on corporate risk management has focused instead on large public companies. This paper studies fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans to see how small firms manage their exposure to interest rate risk. Credit-constrained firms are found to match significantly more often with fixed-rate loans, consistent with prior research that shows the supply of credit shrinks during periods of rising interest rates. Banks originate a higher share of adjustable-rate loans than other lenders, ameliorating maturity mismatch and exposure to the lending channel of monetary policy. Time-series patterns in the fixed-rate share are consistent with recent evidence on debt market timing.",['James Vickery'],"['Risk management', 'Interest rate risk', 'Loans', 'Small firms']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001961,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,87,2,James Vickery,2008,168.96141234708878
Internationalization and the evolution of corporate valuation,"By documenting the evolution of Tobin's q before, during, and after firms internationalize, this paper provides evidence on the bonding, segmentation, and market-timing theories of internationalization. We find that Tobin's q does not rise after internationalization, even relative to domestic firms. Instead, q rises significantly before and during the internationalization year, but then falls sharply in the following year, quickly relinquishing the increases of the previous years. In decomposing these dynamics, we find that market capitalization rises before internationalization and remains high, while corporate assets increase during internationalization. The evidence supports the theory that financial internationalization facilitates corporate expansion, but challenges the theory that internationalization produces an enduring effect on q by bonding firms to a better corporate governance system.","['Juan Carlos Gozzi', 'Ross Levine', 'Sergio L.

Striking oil: Another puzzle?,"Changes in oil prices predict stock market returns worldwide. We find significant predictability in both developed and emerging markets. These results cannot be explained by time-varying risk premia as oil price changes also significantly predict negative excess returns. Investors seem to underreact to information in the price of oil. A rise in oil prices drastically lowers future stock returns. Consistent with the hypothesis of a delayed reaction by investors, the relation between monthly stock returns and lagged monthly oil price changes strengthens once we introduce lags of several trading days between monthly stock returns and lagged monthly oil price changes.","['Gerben Driesprong', 'Ben Jacobsen', 'Benjamin Maat']","['Return predictability', 'Oil prices', 'International stock markets', 'Market efficiency', 'Stock returns', 'Underreaction']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000901,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,2,Gerben Driesprong,2008,168.96141234708878
Who makes acquisitions? CEO overconfidence and the market's reaction,"Does CEO overconfidence help to explain merger decisions? Overconfident CEOs over-estimate their ability to generate returns. As a result, they overpay for target companies and undertake value-destroying mergers. The effects are strongest if they have access to internal financing. We test these predictions using two proxies for overconfidence: CEOs’ personal over-investment in their company and their press portrayal. We find that the odds of making an acquisition are 65% higher if the CEO is classified as overconfident. The effect is largest if the merger is diversifying and does not require external financing. The market reaction at merger announcement (-90 basis points) is significantly more negative than for non-overconfident CEOs (-12 basis points).

Capital structure with risky foreign investment,Firms facing significant business risks have incentives to mitigate the costs of these risks by adjusting their capital structures. This paper investigates this link by analyzing the exposures of multinational firms to political risk. The evidence indicates that returns on investment in politically risky countries are more volatile than returns elsewhere. Multinational firms reduce their leverage in response to these political risks: a one standard deviation increase in foreign political risk is associated with 3.5% reduced leverage. The effect of foreign political risks on leverage is most pronounced for firms in industries whose returns are most susceptible to political influence.,"['Mihir A. Desai', 'C. Fritz Foley', 'James R.

Mixing family with business: A study of Thai business groups and the families behind them,"How does the structure of the families behind business groups affect the group's organization, governance, and performance? We construct a unique dataset of family trees and business groups for 93 of the largest business families in Thailand. We find a strong positive association between family size and family involvement in the ownership and control of the family businesses. The founders’ sons play a central role in both ownership and board membership, especially when the founder of the group is dead. Greater involvement by sons is also associated with lower firm-level performance, especially when the founder is dead. One hypothesis that emerges from our analysis is that part of the decay of family-run groups over time is due to the dilution of ownership and control across a set of equally powerful descendants of the founder, which creates a “race to the bottom” in tunneling resources out of the group firms.","['Marianne Bertrand', 'Simon Johnson', 'Krislert Samphantharak', 'Antoinette Schoar']","['Corporate governance', 'Excess control', 'Groups', 'Families']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000755,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,3,Marianne Bertrand,2008,168.96141234708878
Ultimate ownership and control in Russia,"I investigate ultimate control and ownership patterns in Russian publicly traded companies.

Private owners widely exploit legal loopholes that allow them to mask their holdings and identities through nominee and foreign offshore arrangements. The comparison of formal and informal ownership disclosure reveals that the typical anonymous owners are insiders and that in virtually all cases the market participants “know” who the real owners are.

Venture capital reputation and investment performance,"I propose a new measure of venture capital (VC) firm reputation and analyze its performance implications on private companies. Controlling for portfolio company quality and other VC-specific factors including experience, connectedness, syndication, industry competition, exit conditions, and investment environment, I find companies backed by more reputable VCs by initial public offering (IPO) capitalization share (based on cumulative market capitalization of IPOs backed by the VC), are more likely to exit successfully, access public markets faster, and have higher asset productivity at IPOs. Further tests suggest VCs’ IPO Capitalization share effectively captures both VC screening and monitoring expertise.

Firm-specific information and the efficiency of investment,"In the three-year period following stock market liberalizations, the growth rate of the typical firm's capital stock exceeds its pre-liberalization mean by an average of 4.1 percentage points. Cross-sectional changes in investment are significantly correlated with the signals about fundamentals embedded in the stock price changes that occur upon liberalization. Panel-data estimations show that a 10-percentage point increase in a firm's expected future sales growth predicts a 2.9- to 3.5-percentage point increase in the growth rate of its capital stock.

Why do firms pay dividends? International evidence on the determinants of dividend policy,"In the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, and Japan, the propensity to pay dividends is higher among larger, more profitable firms, and those for which retained earnings comprise a large fraction of total equity. Although there are hints of reductions in the propensity to pay dividends in most of the sample countries over the 1994–2002 period, they are driven by a failure of newly listed firms to initiate dividends when expected to do so. Dividend abandonment and the failure to initiate by existing nonpayers are economically unimportant except in Japan. Moreover, in each country, aggregate dividends have not declined and are concentrated among the largest, most profitable firms. Finally, outside of the US there is little evidence of a systematic positive relation between relative prices of dividend paying and non-paying firms and the propensity to pay dividends. Overall, these findings cast doubt on signaling, clientele, and catering explanations for dividends, but support agency cost-based lifecycle theories.","['David J.

Banks and innovation: Microeconometric evidence on Italian firms,"In this paper we investigate the effect of local banking development on firms’ innovative activities, using a rich data set on innovation for a large number of Italian firms over the 1990s. There is evidence that banking development affects the probability of process innovation, particularly for firms in high-tech sectors, in sectors more dependent upon external finance, and for firms that are small. The evidence for product innovation is much weaker and not robust. There is also some evidence that banking development reduces the cash flow sensitivity of fixed investment spending, particularly for small firms, and that it increases the probability they will engage in R&D.","['Luigi Benfratello', 'Fabio Schiantarelli', 'Alessandro Sembenelli']","['Banks', 'Financial development', 'Innovation', 'R&D', 'Investment']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001293,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,90,2,Luigi Benfratello,2008,168.96141234708878
Venture capital investment cycles: The impact of public markets,It is well documented that the venture capital industry is highly volatile and that much of this volatility is associated with shifting valuations and activity in public equity markets. This paper examines how changes in public market signals affected venture capital investing between 1975 and 1998. We find that venture capitalists with the most industry experience increase their investments the most when public market signals become more favorable. Their reaction to an increase is greater than the reaction of venture capital organizations with relatively little industry experience and those with considerable experience but in other industries. The increase in investment rates does not affect the success of these transactions adversely to a significant extent. These findings are consistent with the view that venture capitalists rationally respond to attractive investment opportunities signaled by public market shifts.,"['Paul Gompers', 'Anna Kovner', 'Josh Lerner', 'David Scharfstein']","['Private equity', 'Initial public offering', 'Market cycles']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001419,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,87,1,Paul Gompers,2008,168.96141234708878
How is macro news transmitted to exchange rates?,"Macro news can affect currency prices directly and indirectly via order flow. Past research shows that the direct effects of scheduled macro news account for less than 10% of daily price variance. This paper shows that the arrival of macro news can account for more than 30% of daily price variance. Two features of our analysis account for this finding: (1) We consider the broad spectrum of macro news items that market participants observe, not just scheduled announcements. (2) We allow the arrival of news to affect prices indirectly via its impact on the volatility of order flow. Our analysis shows that order flow variations contribute more to currency price dynamics following the arrival of public macro news than at other times. This is not consistent with news effects being common knowledge that is impounded in price directly. Roughly two-thirds of the total effect of macro news on the DM/$ exchange rate is transmitted via order flow.","['Martin D.D. Evans', 'Richard K.

Voluntary disclosures around share repurchases,"Managers increase the frequency and magnitude of bad news announcements during the 1-month period prior to repurchasing shares.

These results are consistent with Barclay and Smith's [1988. Corporate payout policy: Cash dividends versus open-market repurchases. Journal of Financial Economics 22, 61–82.] conjecture that share repurchases, unlike dividends, create incentives for managers to manipulate information flows. We further show that managers provide downward-biased earnings forecasts before repurchases and that managers’ propensity to alter information flows prior to share repurchases increases with their ownership interest in the firm.","['Paul Brockman', 'Inder K.

The probability and magnitude of information events,"Models of adverse selection risk generally assume that market makers offset expected losses to informed traders with expected gains from the uninformed. We recognize that the expected loss captures a combination of two effects: (1) the probability that some traders have private information, and (2) the likely magnitude of that information. We use a maximum-likelihood approach to separately estimate the probability and magnitude of private information events for NYSE-listed stocks from 1993 through 2003.

Corporate asset purchases and sales: Theory and evidence,"Purchases and sales of operating assets by firms generated $162 billion for shareholders over the past 20 years. This contrasts sharply with the evidence on mergers. This paper characterizes the behavior of value-maximizing firms, which could grow organically, purchase existing assets, or sell assets. The approach yields an endogenous selection model that links asset purchases and sales to fundamental properties of the firm. Empirical tests confirm the predictions of the model. In particular, return on assets and size strongly predict when firms purchase or sell assets, and the transaction size covaries with the value of capital employed by the firm. These findings indicate that corporate asset purchases and sales are consistent with efficient investment decisions.",['Missaka Warusawitharana'],"['Acquisitions', 'Asset sales', ""Tobin's Q"", 'Selection models']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07002140,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,87,2,Missaka Warusawitharana,2008,168.96141234708878

We analyse rights offerings from two perspectives: market reaction to rights announcements and identification of the factors driving the choice of issue type. Evidence strongly supports the relation between quality signals and issue type. Using a robustly constructed takeup variable, we establish empirical relations between takeup, underwriting status, and renounceability that differ significantly from those previously reported, but which are consistent with the hypotheses developed in this paper.","['Balasingham Balachandran', 'Robert Faff', 'Michael Theobald']","['Rights offerings', 'Takeup', 'Renounceability', 'Underwriting', 'Ownership concentration']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000937,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,2,Balasingham Balachandran,2008,168.96141234708878
Liquidity and market efficiency,"Short-horizon return predictability from order flows is an inverse indicator of market efficiency. We find that such predictability is diminished when bid-ask spreads are narrower, and has declined over time with the minimum tick size. Variance ratio tests suggest that prices were closer to random walk benchmarks in the more liquid decimal regime than in other ones. These findings indicate that liquidity stimulates arbitrage activity, which, in turn, enhances market efficiency. Further, as the tick size decreased, open-close/close-open return variance ratios increased, while return autocorrelations decreased. This suggests an increased incorporation of private information into prices during more liquid regimes.","['Tarun Chordia', 'Richard Roll', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam']","['Liquidity', 'Market efficiency', 'Order flow']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001833,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,87,2,Tarun Chordia,2008,168.96141234708878
Structural models of credit risk are useful: Evidence from hedge ratios on corporate bonds,"Structural models of credit risk provide poor predictions of bond prices. We show that, despite this, they provide quite accurate predictions of the sensitivity of corporate bond returns to changes in the value of equity (hedge ratios). This is important since it suggests that the poor performance of structural models may have more to do with the influence of non-credit factors rather than their failure to capture the credit exposure of corporate debt. The main result of this paper is that even the simplest of the structural models [Merton, R., 1974. On the pricing of corporate debt: the risk structure of interest rates. Journal of Finance 29, 449–470] produces hedge ratios that are not rejected in time-series tests. However, we find that the Merton model (with or without stochastic interest rates) does not capture the interest rate sensitivity of corporate debt, which is substantially lower than would be expected from conventional duration measures. The paper also shows that corporate bond prices are related to a number of market-wide factors such as the Fama-French SMB (small minus big) factor in a way that is not predicted by structural models.","['Stephen M.

Does firm value move too much to be justified by subsequent changes in cash flow?,"The appropriate measure of cash flow for valuing corporate assets is net payout, which is the sum of dividends, interest, and net repurchases of equity and debt. Variation in net payout yield, the ratio of net payout to asset value, is mostly driven by movements in expected cash flow growth, instead of movements in discount rates. Net payout yield is less persistent than dividend yield and implies much smaller variation in long-horizon discount rates. Therefore, movements in the value of corporate assets can be justified by changes in expected future cash flow.","['Borja Larrain', 'Motohiro Yogo']","['Asset valuation', 'Excess volatility', 'Payout policy', 'Valuation ratio']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001584,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,87,1,Borja Larrain,2008,168.96141234708878

The only game in town: Stock-price consequences of local bias,"Theory suggests that, in the presence of local bias, the price of a stock should be decreasing in the ratio of the aggregate book value of firms in its region to the aggregate risk tolerance of investors in its region. Using data on U.S. states and Census regions, we find clear-cut support for this proposition. Most of the variation in the ratio of interest comes from differences across regions in aggregate book value per capita. Regions with low population density—e.g., the Deep South—are home to relatively few firms per capita, which leads to higher stock prices via an “only-game-in-town” effect.","['Harrison Hong', 'Jeffrey D.

Financing and takeovers,"This paper analyzes the interaction between financial leverage and takeover activity. We develop a dynamic model of takeovers in which the financing strategies of bidding firms and the timing and terms of takeovers are jointly determined. In the paper, capital structure plays the role of a commitment device, and determines the outcome of the acquisition contest. We demonstrate that there exists an asymmetric equilibrium in financing policies with endogenous leverage, bankruptcy, and takeover terms, in which the bidder with the lowest leverage wins the takeover contest. Based on the resulting equilibrium, the model generates a number of new predictions. In particular, the model predicts that the leverage of the winning bidder is below the industry average and that acquirers should lever up after the takeover consummation. The model also relates the dispersion in leverage ratios to various industry characteristics, such as cash flow volatility or bankruptcy costs.","['Erwan Morellec', 'Alexei Zhdanov']","['Takeovers', 'Option games', 'Real options', 'Capital structure']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07002152,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,87,3,Erwan Morellec,2008,168.96141234708878

The removal of subsidized credit causes a significant decline in the exports of privately owned firms, while the exports of large, publicly listed, and group network firms are unaffected. Publicly listed firms make no significant adjustments to their balance sheets, and only their profits are reduced, indicating that they are financially unconstrained. Nearly half of all subsidized loans are assigned to such firms, implying a substantial misallocation of credit and an output loss to privately owned firms of 0.75% of GDP.

We also show substantial cross-sectional variation in the cost of capital changes. We find that cost of capital changes were negatively related to both pre-regulation firm size and PIN.

Board classification and managerial entrenchment: Evidence from the market for corporate control,"This paper considers the relation between board classification, takeover activity, and transaction outcomes for a panel of firms between 1990 and 2002. Target board classification does not change the likelihood that a firm, once targeted, is ultimately acquired. Moreover, shareholders of targets with a classified board realize bid returns that are equivalent to those of targets with a single class of directors, but receive a higher proportion of total bid surplus. Board classification does reduce the likelihood of receiving a takeover bid, however, the economic effect of bid deterrence on the value of the firm is quite small. Overall, the evidence is inconsistent with the conventional wisdom that board classification is an anti-takeover device that facilitates managerial entrenchment.","['Thomas W. Bates', 'David A.

Firms that only pay dividends are largely extinct. Repurchases are increasingly used in place of dividends, even for firms that continue to pay dividends.

We estimate the uses of funds raised in both initial and seasoned offerings. Firms appear to spend incremental dollars on both R&D and capital expenditures, consistent with the investment financing explanation of equity issues.

The local advantage is high in countries where earnings are smoothed more, less information is disclosed by firms, and firm idiosyncratic information explains a smaller fraction of stock returns. It is negatively related to whether a firm has foreign assets and to market participation by foreign investors and by institutions, and positively related to holdings by insiders.

I use a bivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to estimate a portfolio's conditional covariance with the market and then test whether the conditional covariance predicts time–variation in the portfolio's expected return. Restricting the slope to be the same across assets, the risk-return coefficient is highly significant with a risk–aversion coefficient (slope) between one and five.

Financial distress and corporate risk management: Theory and evidence,"This paper extends the current theoretical models of corporate risk-management in the presence of financial distress costs and tests the model's predictions using a comprehensive data set. I show that the shareholders optimally engage in ex-post (i.e., after the debt issuance) risk-management activities even without a pre-commitment to do so. The model predicts a positive (negative) relation between leverage and hedging for moderately (highly) leveraged firms. Consistent with the theory, empirically I find a non-monotonic relation between leverage and hedging. Further, the effect of leverage on hedging is higher for firms in highly concentrated industries.",['Amiyatosh Purnanandam'],"['Hedging', 'Risk-shifting', 'Asset substitution', 'Derivatives']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07002176,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,87,3,Amiyatosh Purnanandam,2008,168.96141234708878
Incumbents and protectionism: The political economy of foreign entry liberalization,"This paper investigates the influence of incumbent firms on the decision to allow foreign direct investment into an industry. Using data from India's economic reforms, the results show that firms in concentrated industries are more successful at preventing foreign entry, state-owned firms are more successful at stopping foreign entry than privately-owned firms, and profitable state-owned firms are more successful at stopping foreign entry than unprofitable state-owned firms. The pattern of foreign entry liberalization supports the private interest view of policy implementation and suggests that it may be necessary to reduce the influence of state-owned firms to optimally enact reforms.","['Anusha Chari', 'Nandini Gupta']","['Foreign direct investment', 'Entry deregulation', 'Industry concentration', 'State ownership', 'Privatization']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000627,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,3,Anusha Chari,2008,168.96141234708878
Corporate misreporting and bank loan contracting,"This paper is the first to study the effect of financial restatement on bank loan contracting. Compared with loans initiated before restatement, loans initiated after restatement have significantly higher spreads, shorter maturities, higher likelihood of being secured, and more covenant restrictions. The increase in loan spread is significantly larger for fraudulent restating firms than other restating firms. We also find that after restatement, the number of lenders per loan declines and firms pay higher upfront and annual fees. These results are consistent with banks using tighter loan contract terms to overcome risk and information problems arising from financial restatements.","['John R.

Capital structure and international debt shifting,"This paper presents a model of a multinational firm's optimal debt policy that incorporates international taxation factors. The model yields the prediction that a multinational firm's indebtedness in a country depends on a weighted average of national tax rates and differences between national and foreign tax rates. These differences matter as multinationals have an incentive to shift debt to high-tax countries. The predictions of the model are tested using a novel firm-level dataset for European multinationals and their subsidiaries, combined with newly collected data on the international tax treatment of dividend and interest streams. Our empirical results show that a foreign subsidiary's capital structure reflects local corporate tax rates as well as tax rate differences vis-à-vis the parent firm and other foreign subsidiaries, although the overall economic effect of taxes on leverage appears to be small. Ignoring the international debt shifting arising from differences in national tax rates would understate the impact of national taxes on debt policies by about 25%.","['Harry Huizinga', 'Luc Laeven', 'Gaetan Nicodeme']","['Corporate taxation', 'Financial structure', 'Debt shifting']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000123,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,1,Harry Huizinga,2008,168.96141234708878
Option valuation with long-run and short-run volatility components,"This paper presents a new model for the valuation of European options, in which the volatility of returns consists of two components. One is a long-run component and can be modeled as fully persistent. The other is short-run and has a zero mean. Our model can be viewed as an affine version of Engle and Lee [1999. A permanent and transitory component model of stock return volatility. In: Engle, R., White, H. (Eds.), Cointegration, Causality, and Forecasting: A Festschrift in Honor of Clive W.J. Granger. Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 475–497], allowing for easy valuation of European options. The model substantially outperforms a benchmark single-component volatility model that is well established in the literature, and it fits options better than a model that combines conditional heteroskedasticity and Poisson–normal jumps. The component model's superior performance is partly due to its improved ability to model the smirk and the path of spot volatility, but its most distinctive feature is its ability to model the volatility term structure. This feature enables the component model to jointly model long-maturity and short-maturity options.","['Peter Christoffersen', 'Kris Jacobs', 'Chayawat Ornthanalai', 'Yintian Wang']","['Volatility term structure', 'GARCH', 'Out-of-sample']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0800144X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,90,3,Peter Christoffersen,2008,168.96141234708878
Seasonality in the cross-section of stock returns,"This paper presents a new pattern in the cross-section of expected stock returns. Stocks tend to have relatively high (or low) returns every year in the same calendar month. We recognize the annual cross-sectional autocorrelation pattern documented in Jegadeesh [1990. Evidence of predictable behavior of security returns. Journal of Finance 45, 881–898] at lags of 12, 24, and 36 months as part of a general pattern that lasts up to 20 annual lags, superimposed on the general momentum/reversal patterns. This pattern explains an economically and statistically significant magnitude of the cross-sectional variation in average stock returns. Volume and volatility exhibit similar seasonal patterns but they do not explain the seasonality in returns. The pattern is independent of size, industry, earnings announcements, dividends, and fiscal year. The results are consistent with the existence of a persistent seasonal effect in stock returns.","['Steven L.

Do investors value smooth performance?,"This paper presents empirical evidence that cash-flow volatility is negatively valued by investors. The magnitude of the effect is substantial with a 1% increase in cash-flow volatility, resulting in approximately a 0.15% decrease in firm value. We show that this increase, however, is not associated with earnings smoothing resulting from managers’ accrual estimates. Our results are consistent with a preference by the market for less volatile cash flows and suggest that managers’ efforts to produce smooth financial statements add value, but only via the cash component of earnings.","['Brian Rountree', 'James P.

Evaluating the real effect of bank branching deregulation: Comparing contiguous counties across US state borders,"This paper proposes a new methodology to evaluate the economic effect of state-specific policy changes, using bank-branching deregulations in the US as an example. The new method compares economic performance of pairs of contiguous counties separated by state borders, where on one side restrictions on statewide branching were removed relatively earlier, to create a natural “regression discontinuity” setup. The study uses a total of 285 pairs of contiguous counties along 38 segments of such regulation change borders to estimate treatment effects for 23 separate deregulation events taking place between 1975 and 1990. To distinguish real treatment effects from those created by data-snooping and spatial correlations, fictitious placebo deregulations are randomized (permutated) on another 32 segments of non-event borders to establish empirically a statistical table of critical values for the estimator. The method determines that statistically significant growth accelerations can be established at a > 90% confidence level in five (and none prior to 1985) out of the 23 deregulation events examined. “Hinterland counties” within the still-regulated states, but farther away from the state borders, are used as a second control group to consider and reject the possibility that cross-border spillover of deregulation effects may invalidate the empirical design.",['Rocco R.

Boards: Does one size fit all?,"This paper reexamines the relation between firm value and board structure. We find that complex firms, which have greater advising requirements than simple firms, have larger boards with more outside directors. The relation between Tobin's Q and board size is U-shaped, which, at face value, suggests that either very small or very large boards are optimal. This relation, however, arises from differences between complex and simple firms. Tobin's Q increases (decreases) in board size for complex (simple) firms, and this relation is driven by the number of outside directors. We find some evidence that R&D-intensive firms, for which the firm-specific knowledge of insiders is relatively important, have a higher fraction of insiders on the board and that, for these firms, Q increases with the fraction of insiders on the board. Our findings challenge the notion that restrictions on board size and management representation on the board necessarily enhance firm value.","['Jeffrey L. Coles', 'Naveen D.

The EH is rejected throughout the term structure examined on the basis of the statistical tests. However, the results of our economic analysis are favorable to the EH, suggesting that the statistical rejections of the EH in the repo market are economically insignificant.","['Pasquale Della Corte', 'Lucio Sarno', 'Daniel L.

"Ex-dividend day trading: Who, how, and why?","This study examines the ex-dividend day trading behavior of all investors in the Finnish stock market. Consistent with dynamic dividend clientele theories, investors with a preference for dividend income buy shares cum-dividend and sell ex-dividend; the reverse is true for investors with the opposite preference. Investors also engage in overnight arbitrage, earning on average a 2% overnight return on their invested capital.

Can real options explain financing behavior?,"Trade-off models commonly invoke financial transaction costs in order to explain observed leverage fluctuations. This paper offers an alternative explanation based on real options. The model is frictionless on the financing side but incorporates irreversibility and fixed costs of investment. Results obtained from simulating the model are broadly consistent with observed financing patterns. Market leverage ratios are negatively related to profitability, mean-reverting, and depend on past stock returns. The gradual and lumpy leverage adjustments can occur in the absence of financial transaction costs.

Creative destruction and firm-specific performance heterogeneity,"Traditional U.S. industries with higher firm-specific stock return and fundamentals performance heterogeneity use information technology (IT) more intensively and post faster productivity growth in the late 20th century. We argue that this mechanically reflects a wave of Schumpeter's creative destruction disrupting a wide swath of industries, with successful IT adopters unpredictably undermining established firms. This validates endogenous growth theory models of creative destruction and suggests intensified creative destruction as explaining findings associating greater firm-specific performance variation with higher per capita GDPs, economy growth rates, accounting standards, financial system development, and property right protection.","['Hyunbae Chun', 'Jung-Wook Kim', 'Randall Morck', 'Bernard Yeung']","['Creative destruction', 'Firm-specific variation', 'Information technology']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000433,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,1,Hyunbae Chun,2008,168.96141234708878
The determinants of board structure,"Using a comprehensive sample of nearly 7,000 firms from 1990 to 2004, we examine the corporate board structure, trends, and determinants. Guided by recent theoretical work, we find that board structure across firms is consistent with the costs and benefits of the board's monitoring and advising roles. Our models explain as much as 45% of the observed variation in board structure. Further, small and large firms have dramatically different board structures. For example, board size fell in the 1990s for large firms, a trend that reversed at the time of mandated reforms, while board size was relatively flat for small and medium-sized firms.","['James S.

Financing patterns around the world: Are small firms different?,"Using a firm-level survey database covering 48 countries, we investigate how financial and institutional development affects financing of large and small firms. Our database is not limited to large firms but includes small and medium-size firms and data on a broad spectrum of financing sources, including leasing, supplier, development, and informal finance. Small firms and firms in countries with poor institutions use less external finance, especially bank finance. Protection of property rights increases external financing of small firms significantly more than of large firms, mainly due to its effect on bank finance. Small firms do not use disproportionately more leasing or trade finance compared with larger firms, so these financing sources do not compensate for lower access to bank financing of small firms. We also find that larger firms more easily expand external financing when they are constrained than small firms. Finally, we find suggestive evidence that the pecking order holds across countries.","['Thorsten Beck', 'Asli Demirgüç-Kunt', 'Vojislav Maksimovic']","['Financial development', 'Financing patterns', 'Capital structure', 'Security issuance', 'Small and medium-size enterprises']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000986,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,3,Thorsten Beck,2008,168.96141234708878
Corporate governance and firm cash holdings in the US,"Using governance metrics based on antitakeover provisions and inside ownership, we find that firms with weaker corporate governance structures actually have smaller cash reserves. When distributing cash to shareholders, firms with weaker governance structures choose to repurchase instead of increasing dividends, avoiding future payout commitments. The combination of excess cash and weak shareholder rights leads to increases in capital expenditures and acquisitions. Firms with low shareholder rights and excess cash have lower profitability and valuations. However, there is only limited evidence that the presence of excess cash alters the overall relation between governance and profitability. In the US, weakly controlled managers choose to spend cash quickly on acquisitions and capital expenditures, rather than hoard it.","['Jarrad Harford', 'Sattar A. Mansi', 'William F.

Political connections and preferential access to finance: The role of campaign contributions,"Using novel indicators of political connections constructed from campaign contribution data, we show that Brazilian firms that provided contributions to (elected) federal deputies experienced higher stock returns than firms that did not around the 1998 and 2002 elections. This suggests that contributions help shape policy on a firm-specific basis. Using a firm fixed effects framework to mitigate the risk that unobserved firm characteristics distort the results, we find that contributing firms substantially increased their bank financing relative to a control group after each election, indicating that access to bank finance is an important channel through which political connections operate. We estimate the economic costs of this rent seeking over the two election cycles to be at least 0.2% of gross domestic product per annum.","['Stijn Claessens', 'Erik Feijen', 'Luc Laeven']","['Campaign contributions', 'Elections', 'Corruption', 'Preferential lending']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001353,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,3,Stijn Claessens,2008,168.96141234708878
Why do private acquirers pay so little compared to public acquirers?,"Using the longest event window, we find that public target shareholders receive a 63% (14%) higher premium when the acquirer is a public firm rather than a private equity firm (private operating firm). The premium difference holds with the usual controls for deal and target characteristics, and it is highest (lowest) when acquisitions by private bidders are compared to acquisitions by public companies with low (high) managerial ownership. Further, the premium paid by public bidders (not private bidders) increases with target managerial and institutional ownership.","['Leonce L. Bargeron', 'Frederik P. Schlingemann', 'René M.

Decomposing swap spreads,"We analyze a six-factor model for Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and swap rates and decompose swap spreads into three components: a convenience yield from holding Treasuries, a credit risk element from the underlying LIBOR rate, and a factor specific to the swap market. The convenience yield is by far the largest component of spreads. There is a discernible contribution from credit risk as well as from a swap-specific factor with higher variability which in certain periods is related to hedging activity in the mortgage-backed security market. The model also sheds light on the relation between AA hazard rates and the spread between LIBOR rates and General Collateral repo rates and on the level of the riskless rate compared to swap and Treasury rates.","['Peter Feldhütter', 'David Lando']","['Swap rates', 'Term structure', 'Credit risk', 'Liquidity']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000275,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,2,Peter Feldhütter,2008,168.96141234708878
Financial expertise of directors,"We analyze how directors with financial expertise affect corporate decisions. Using a novel panel data set, we find that financial experts exert significant influence, though not necessarily in the interest of shareholders. When commercial bankers join boards, external funding increases and investment-cash flow sensitivity decreases. However, the increased financing flows to firms with good credit but poor investment opportunities. Similarly, investment bankers on boards are associated with larger bond issues but worse acquisitions. We find little evidence that financial experts affect compensation policy. The results suggest that increasing financial expertise on boards may not benefit shareholders if conflicting interests (e.g., bank profits) are neglected.","['A.

Entrepreneurial finance: Banks versus venture capital,"We analyze how entrepreneurial firms choose between two funding institution: banks, which monitor less intensively and face liquidity demands from their own investors, and venture capitalists, who can monitor more intensively but face a higher cost of capital because of the liquidity constraints that they impose on their own investors. Because the firm's manager prefers continuing the firm over liquidating it and aggressive (risky) continuation strategies over conservative (safe) continuation strategies, the institution must monitor the firm and exercise some control over its decisions. Bank finance takes the form of debt, whereas venture capital finance often resembles convertible debt. Venture capital finance is optimal only when the aggressive continuation strategy is not too profitable, ex ante; the uncertainty associated with the risky continuation strategy (strategic uncertainty) is high; and the firm's cash flow distribution is highly risky and positively skewed, with low probability of success, low liquidation value, and high returns if successful. A decrease in venture capitalists’ cost of capital encourages firms to switch from safe strategies and bank finance to riskier strategies and venture capital finance, increasing the average risk of firms in the economy.","['Andrew Winton', 'Vijay Yerramilli']","['Banks', 'Venture capital', 'Entrepreneurial finance', 'Strategic uncertainty', 'Monitoring']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000135,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,1,Andrew Winton,2008,168.96141234708878
"Managerial incentives, capital reallocation, and the business cycle","We argue that when managers have private information about the productivity of assets under their control and receive private benefits, substantial bonuses are required to induce less productive managers to declare that capital should be reallocated. The need to provide incentives for managers to relinquish control links executive compensation to capital reallocation and managerial turnover over the business cycle, rendering them procyclical if expected managerial compensation increases when more managers are hired. Moreover, capital is less productively deployed in downturns because agency costs make reallocation more costly. Empirically, we find that both CEO turnover and executive compensation are remarkably procyclical.","['Andrea L. Eisfeldt', 'Adriano A.

Corporate governance and pay-for-performance: The impact of earnings management,"We ask whether the apparent impact of governance structure and incentive-based compensation on firm performance stands up when measured performance is adjusted for the effects of earnings management. Institutional ownership of shares, institutional investor representation on the board of directors, and the presence of independent outside directors on the board all reduce the use of discretionary accruals. These factors largely offset the impact of option compensation, which strongly encourages earnings management. Adjusting for the impact of earnings management substantially increases the measured importance of governance variables and dramatically decreases the impact of incentive-based compensation on corporate performance.","['Marcia Millon Cornett', 'Alan J.

Do auctions induce a winner's curse? New evidence from the corporate takeover market,"We contrast the winner's curse hypothesis and the competitive market hypothesis as potential explanations for the observed returns to bidders in corporate takeovers. The winner's curse hypothesis posits suboptimal behavior in which winning bidders fail to adapt their strategies to the level of competition and the amount of uncertainty in the takeover environment and predicts that bidder returns are inversely related to the level of competition in a given deal and to the uncertainty in the value of the target. Our measure of takeover competition comes from a unique data set on the auction process that occurs prior to the announcement of a takeover. In our empirical estimation, we control for the endogeneity between bidder returns and the level of competition in takeover deals. Controlling for endogeneity, we find that the returns to bidders are not significantly related to takeover competition. We also find that uncertainty in the value of the target does not reduce bidder returns. Related analysis indicates that prestigious investment banks do not promote overbidding. Analysis of post-takeover operating performance also fails to find any negative effects of takeover competition. As a whole, the results indicate that the breakeven returns to bidders in corporate takeovers stem not from the winner's curse but from the competitive market for targets that occurs predominantly prior to the public announcement of bids.","['Audra L.

A theory of the transition to secondary market trading of IPOs,"We develop a model in which investment banks and institutional investors collaborate in smoothing an initial public offering's (IPOs) transition to secondary market trading. Their intervention promotes welfare under the assumption that significant new information arrives in the market in the immediate aftermath of the IPO. Under this assumption, it is optimal to stage the offering and suboptimal to commit to selling shares at a uniform price. The optimal strategy yields an economic rationale for secondary market price stabilization for IPOs carried out via a well-coordinated network of repeat institutional investors.","['Zhaohui Chen', 'William J.

Cycles in the IPO market,"We develop a model in which time-varying real investment opportunities lead to time-varying adverse selection in the market for IPOs. The model is consistent with several stylized facts known about the IPO market: economic expansions are associated with a dramatic increase in the number of firms going public, which is in turn positively correlated with underpricing. Adverse selection is procyclical in the sense that dispersion in unobservable quality across firms should be more pronounced during booms. Taking the premise that uncertainty is resolved (and thus private information revealed) over time, we test this hypothesis by looking at long-run abnormal returns and delisting rates. Consistent with the model, we find (a) greater cross-sectional return variance, and (b) higher incidence of delisting for hot-market IPOs.","['Chris Yung', 'Gönül Çolak']","['Initial public offerings', 'Adverse selection', 'Underpricing', 'Delisting rates', 'Cross-sectional return variance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000780,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,1,Chris Yung,2008,168.96141234708878
Advisors and asset prices: A model of the origins of bubbles,"We develop a model of asset price bubbles based on the communication process between advisors and investors. Advisors are well-intentioned and want to maximize the welfare of their advisees (like a parent treats a child). But only some advisors understand the new technology (the tech-savvies); others do not and can only make a downward-biased recommendation (the old-fogies). While smart investors recognize the heterogeneity in advisors, naive ones mistakenly take whatever is said at face value. Tech-savvies inflate their forecasts to signal that they are not old-fogies, since more accurate information about their type improves the welfare of investors in the future. A bubble arises for a wide range of parameters, and its size is maximized when there is a mix of smart and naive investors in the economy. Our model suggests an alternative source for stock over-valuation in addition to investor overreaction to news and sell-side bias.","['Harrison Hong', 'José Scheinkman', 'Wei Xiong']","['Analyst forecast', 'New technology bubble', 'Reputation concern', 'Heterogeneous beliefs']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000743,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,2,Harrison Hong,2008,168.96141234708878
Firms as buyers of last resort,"We develop a model to explore the asset pricing implications of firms being buyers of last resort for their own stocks. Those with more ability to repurchase shares when prices drop far below fundamental value (i.e., less financially constrained firms) should have lower short-horizon return variances (controlling for fundamental variance) than other firms. Using standard proxies for financing constraints such as past repurchases and firm age, we find strong support for this predicted relation. We also find that this relation is stronger in the U.S. after 1982 when regulatory reforms lowered the legal cost of conducting repurchases as well as in countries where share repurchases are legally easier to execute.","['Harrison Hong', 'Jiang Wang', 'Jialin Yu']","['Repurchase', 'Financing constraint', 'Return variance', 'Return skewness', 'Liquidity']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000196,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,1,Harrison Hong,2008,168.96141234708878
"Stochastic risk premiums, stochastic skewness in currency options, and stochastic discount factors in international economies","We develop models of stochastic discount factors in international economies that produce stochastic risk premiums and stochastic skewness in currency options. We estimate the models using time-series returns and option prices on three currency pairs that form a triangular relation. Estimation shows that the average risk premium in Japan is larger than that in the US or the UK, the global risk premium is more persistent and volatile than the country-specific risk premiums, and investors respond differently to different shocks. We also identify high-frequency jumps in each economy but find that only downside jumps are priced. Finally, our analysis shows that the risk premiums are economically compatible with movements in stock and bond market fundamentals.","['Gurdip Bakshi', 'Peter Carr', 'Liuren Wu']","['Stochastic discount factors', 'International economy', 'Stochastic risk premium', 'Stochastic skewness', 'Currency options', 'Foreign exchange rate dynamics', 'Time-changed Lévy processes', 'Unscented Kalman filter']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001432,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,87,1,Gurdip Bakshi,2008,168.96141234708878
How common are common return factors across the NYSE and Nasdaq?,"We entertain the possibility of pervasive factors that are not common across two (or more) groups of securities. We propose and implement a general procedure to estimate the space spanned by common and group-specific pervasive factors. In our empirical analysis, we study the factor structure of excess returns on stocks traded on the NYSE and Nasdaq using our methodology. We find that there are only two common pervasive factors that govern the returns for both NYSE and Nasdaq. At the same time, the NYSE and Nasdaq each have one more group-specific factor that is not the same across the two exchanges. Our results point to the absence of complete similarity between the factors driving the returns on these exchanges.","['Amit Goyal', 'Christophe Pérignon', 'Christophe Villa']","['Risk factors', 'Factor analysis', 'Asset pricing', 'Arbitrage pricing theory', 'Common subspace']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001487,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,90,3,Amit Goyal,2008,168.96141234708878
Pricing the commonality across alternative measures of liquidity,"We estimate latent factor models of liquidity, aggregated across various liquidity measures. Shocks to assets’ liquidity have a common component across measures which accounts for most of the explained variation in individual liquidity measures. We find that across-measure systematic liquidity is a priced factor while within-measure systematic liquidity does not exhibit additional pricing information. Controlling for across-measure systematic liquidity risk, there is some evidence that liquidity, as a characteristic of assets, is priced in the cross-section. Our results are robust to the inclusion of other equity characteristics and risk factors, such as market capitalization, book-to-market, and momentum.","['Robert A.

Do boards pay attention when institutional investor activists “just vote no”?,"We examine “just vote no” campaigns, a recent innovation in low-cost shareholder activist tools whereby activists encourage their fellow shareholders to withhold votes toward a director's election to express dissatisfaction with management performance or the firm's corporate governance structure. Grundfest [1993. Just vote no: a minimalist strategy for dealing with barbarians inside the gates. Stanford Law Review 45, 857–937] argues that a substantial withheld vote motivates directors to take immediate action to avoid further embarrassment. We find a variety of supportive evidence, including operating performance improvements and abnormal disciplinary chief executive officer (CEO) turnover, indicating that such campaigns induce boards to take actions in shareholders’ interests. Furthermore, abnormal turnover is robust to controlling for concurrent events and firm- and CEO-specific controls.","['Diane Del Guercio', 'Laura Seery', 'Tracie Woidtke']","['Shareholder activism', 'CEO turnover', 'Director reputation', 'Public pension funds', 'Director elections']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001311,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,90,1,Diane Del Guercio,2008,168.96141234708878
Dividends and share repurchases in the European Union,"We examine cash dividends and share repurchases from 1989 to 2005 in the 15 nations that were members of the European Union before May 2004. As in the United States, the fraction of European firms paying dividends declines, while total real dividends paid increase and share repurchases surge. We also show that financial reporting frequency is associated with higher payout, and that privatized companies account for almost one-quarter of total cash dividends and share repurchases. Our regression analyses indicate that increasing fractions of retained earnings to equity do not increase the likelihood of cash payouts, whereas company age does.","['Henk von Eije', 'William L.

Testing limits to policy reversal: Evidence from Indian privatizations,"We examine the effect of regime change on privatization. In the 2004 Indian election, the pro-reform BJP was unexpectedly defeated by a less reformist coalition. Stock prices of government-controlled companies that had been slated for privatization by the BJP dropped 3.5% relative to private firms. Government-controlled companies that were under study for possible privatization fell 7.5% relative to private firms. This is consistent with investor belief of a “point of no return,” where advanced reforms are more difficult to reverse. Further analysis suggests that layoffs, combined with the privatization announcement, served as a credible commitment to privatize.","['Siddhartha G.

The importance of IRS monitoring to debt pricing in private firms,"We examine the link between Internal Revenue Service (IRS) monitoring and yield spreads on private firms’ 144A bond issues. After controlling for security-specific and other firm-specific determinants, we provide evidence that debt financing is cheaper when the probability of a face-to-face IRS audit is higher. Consistent with another prediction, we find that IRS oversight has a stronger impact on bond pricing for private firms with high ownership concentration, which suffer worse agency problems between controlling shareholders and outside investors. Collectively, our research implies that IRS monitoring plays a valuable corporate governance role by reducing information asymmetry evident in borrowing costs.","['Omrane Guedhami', 'Jeffrey Pittman']","['Corporate governance', 'Taxes', 'Agency costs of debt', 'Ownership structure']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001177,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,90,1,Omrane Guedhami,2008,168.96141234708878
The power of the pen and executive compensation,"We examine the press’ role in monitoring and influencing executive compensation practice using more than 11,000 press articles about CEO compensation from 1994 to 2002. Negative press coverage is more strongly related to excess annual pay than to raw annual pay, suggesting a sophisticated approach by the media in selecting CEOs to cover. However, negative coverage is also greater for CEOs with more option exercises, suggesting the press engages in some degree of “sensationalism.” We find little evidence that firms respond to negative press coverage by decreasing excess CEO compensation or increasing CEO turnover.","['John E.

Second time lucky? Withdrawn IPOs that return to the market,We investigate issuers withdrawing an IPO (after security regulation filings) that return later for a successful offering. Venture capital backing and reputation of the lead underwriter are key factors in predicting successful return. The possibility of returning has a significant impact on the decision to withdraw and the pricing of offerings that succeed. Our sample of returning IPOs also provides a unique setting to investigate underwriter switching after a withdrawal but before a successful IPO. We find that switching occurs in response to poor bank performance and when switching firms “graduate” to banks that have high industry market shares.,"['Craig G. Dunbar', 'Stephen R.

We find a positive relation, especially in countries with weak legal protection for shareholders. The findings suggest that a dominant shareholder, were he so inclined, could offset, at least in part, the documented value discount associated with weak country-level shareholder protection by appointing an ‘independent’ board. The cost to the dominant shareholder of doing so is the loss in perquisites associated with being a dominant shareholder. Thus, not all dominant shareholders choose independent boards.","['Jay Dahya', 'Orlin Dimitrov', 'John J.

Why firms purchase property insurance,"We investigate whether corporate finance incentives affect the extent of corporate hedging with property insurance. Using a database that contains detailed insurance information, we document a positive relation between the expected costs of distress and property insurance coverage. We also show that the dividend payout ratio is negatively associated with property insurance coverage, consistent with the view that firms with high payout ratios insure a smaller fraction of properties due to cash flows in excess of investment needs, easy access to capital markets, or both. Different incentives are important for the insurance deductible and limit of coverage, and the deductible and limit of coverage are substitutes.","['Daniel Aunon-Nerin', 'Paul Ehling']","['Corporate risk management', 'Property insurance']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0800130X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,90,3,Daniel Aunon-Nerin,2008,168.96141234708878
Does international cross-listing improve the information environment,"We investigate whether cross-listing in the U.S. affects the information environment for non-U.S. stocks. Our findings suggest cross-listing has an asymmetric impact on stock price informativeness around the world, as measured by firm-specific stock return variation. Cross-listing improves price informativeness for developed market firms. For firms in emerging markets, however, cross-listing decreases price informativeness. The added analyst coverage associated with cross-listing likely explains the findings in emerging markets, rather than changes in liquidity, ownership, or accounting quality. Our results indicate that the added analyst coverage fosters the production of marketwide information, rather than firm-specific information.","['Nuno Fernandes', 'Miguel A.

"Latent liquidity: A new measure of liquidity, with an application to corporate bonds","We present a new measure of liquidity known as “latent liquidity” and apply it to a unique corporate bond database. Latent liquidity is defined as the weighted average turnover of investors who hold a bond, in which the weights are the fractional investor holdings. It can be used to measure liquidity in markets with sparse transactions data.

Debt and managerial rents in a real-options model of the firm,"We present a theory of capital investment and debt and equity financing in a real-options model of a public corporation. The theory assumes that managers maximize the present value of their future compensation (managerial rents), subject to constraints imposed by outside shareholders’ property rights to the firm's assets. Absent bankruptcy costs, managers follow an optimal debt policy that generates efficient investment and disinvestment. We show how bankruptcy costs can distort both investment and disinvestment. We also show how managers’ personal wealth constraints can lead to delayed investment and increased reliance on debt financing. Changes in cash flow can cause changes in investment by tightening or loosening the wealth constraints. Firms with weaker investor protection adopt higher debt levels.","['Bart M.

Does the use of peer groups contribute to higher pay and less efficient compensation?,We provide empirical evidence on how the practice of competitive benchmarking affects chief executive officer (CEO) pay. We find that the use of benchmarking is widespread and has a significant impact on CEO compensation. One view is that benchmarking is inefficient because it can lead to increases in executive pay not tied to firm performance. A contrasting view is that benchmarking is a practical and efficient mechanism used to gauge the market wage necessary to retain valuable human capital. Our empirical results generally support the latter view. Our findings also suggest that the documented asymmetry in the relationship between CEO pay and luck is explained by the firm's desire to adjust pay for retention purposes and is not the result of rent-seeking behavior on the part of the CEO.,"['John M.

"Stock price informativeness, cross-listings, and investment decisions","We show that a cross-listing enables firms to obtain, from the stock market, more precise information about the value of their growth opportunities. Thus, cross-listed firms make better investment decisions and trade at a premium. This theory of cross-listings implies that the sensitivity of investment to stock prices is larger for cross-listed firms. Moreover, the cross-listing premium is positively related to the size of growth opportunities and negatively related to the quality of managerial information. The sensitivity of the premium to the size of growth opportunities increases with factors that strengthen the impact of the cross-listing on price informativeness.","['Thierry Foucault', 'Thomas Gehrig']","['Cross-listings', 'Cross-listing premium', 'Price informativeness', 'Investment']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000202,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,1,Thierry Foucault,2008,168.96141234708878
"Cross-ownership, returns, and voting in mergers","We show that institutional shareholders of acquiring companies on average do not lose money around public merger announcements, because they hold substantial stakes in the targets and make up for the losses from the acquirers with the gains from the targets. Depending on their holdings in the target, acquirer shareholders generally realize different returns from the same merger, some losing money and others gaining. This conflict of interest is reflected in the mutual fund voting behavior: In mergers with negative acquirer announcement returns, cross-owners are significantly more likely to vote for the merger.","['Gregor Matvos', 'Michael Ostrovsky']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Bidder returns', 'Proxy voting']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08001013,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,3,Gregor Matvos,2008,168.96141234708878
Information flows within financial conglomerates: Evidence from the banks–mutual funds relation,"We study how information flows within financial conglomerates by analyzing the relations between mutual funds and banks that belong to the same financial group. We investigate the effect that the lending behavior of affiliated banks has on the portfolio choice of the mutual funds that are part of the same group. We show that funds (fund families) increase their stakes in the firms that borrow from their affiliated banks in the period following the deal by far greater amounts than other unaffiliated funds (fund families). We provide evidence that this strategy is information-driven. The performance of the positions of affiliated funds in the stocks of borrowing firms exceeds that of their other positions in nonborrowing stocks located in the same industry as well as that of other stocks having similar characteristics by up to 1.6% per month. Funds increase (decrease) their stock holdings in those borrowing stocks that subsequently provide positive (negative) abnormal returns, suggesting that they exploit privileged inside information not available to other market participants. This behavior is prevalent largely in funds located in close geographic proximity to their lending banks. Furthermore, it is exhibited mostly by young, small, and poorly performing fund families. Our evidence points to information flows within conglomerates through informal channels such as personal acquaintances.","['Massimo Massa', 'Zahid Rehman']","['Conflict of interest', 'Mutual funds', 'Banks']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000792,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,2,Massimo Massa,2008,168.96141234708878
The colors of investors’ money: The role of institutional investors around the world,"We study the role of institutional investors around the world using a comprehensive data set of equity holdings from 27 countries. We find that all institutional investors have a strong preference for the stock of large firms and firms with good governance, while foreign institutions tend to overweight firms that are cross-listed in the U.S. and members of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index. Firms with higher ownership by foreign and independent institutions have higher firm valuations, better operating performance, and lower capital expenditures.

Automatic bankruptcy auctions and fire-sales,"We test for fire-sale tendencies in automatic bankruptcy auctions. We find evidence consistent with fire-sale discounts when the auction leads to piecemeal liquidation, but not when the bankrupt firm is acquired as a going concern. Neither industry-wide distress nor the industry affiliation of the buyer affect prices in going-concern sales. Bids are often structured as leveraged buyouts, which relaxes liquidity constraints and reduces bidder underinvestment incentives in the presence of debt overhang. Prices in “prepack” auctions (sales agreements negotiated prior to bankruptcy filing) are on average lower than for in-auction going-concern sales, suggesting that prepacks may help preempt excessive liquidation when the auction is expected to be illiquid. Prepack targets have a greater industry-adjusted probability of refiling for bankruptcy, indicating that liquidation preemption is a risky strategy.","['B. Espen Eckbo', 'S.

"Trading imbalances, predictable reversals, and cross-stock price pressure",We test the implications of a multi-asset equilibrium model in which a finite number of risk-averse liquidity providers accommodate non-informational trading imbalances. These imbalances generate predictable reversals in stock returns. An imbalance in one stock also affects the prices of other stocks. The magnitude of the cross-stock price pressure depends on the correlations of the stocks’ underlying cash flows. The model implies that non-informational trading increases the volatility of stock returns. We confirm the model's implications using data from the Taiwan Stock Exchange.,"['Sandro C.

Fully 93% lose their jobs by the end of the regulatory enforcement period. Most are explicitly fired. The likelihood of ouster increases with the cost of the misconduct to shareholders and the quality of the firm's governance. Culpable managers also bear substantial financial losses through restrictions on their future employment, their shareholdings in the firm, and SEC fines. A sizeable minority (28%) face criminal charges and penalties, including jail sentences that average 4.3 years.

Dumb money: Mutual fund flows and the cross-section of stock returns,"We use mutual fund flows as a measure of individual investor sentiment for different stocks, and find that high sentiment predicts low future returns. Fund flows are dumb money–by reallocating across different mutual funds, retail investors reduce their wealth in the long run. This dumb money effect is related to the value effect: high sentiment stocks tend to be growth stocks. High sentiment also is associated with high corporate issuance, interpretable as companies increasing the supply of shares in response to investor demand.","['Andrea Frazzini', 'Owen A.

On the importance of retail banking relationships,"We use proprietary data to analyze the importance of retail banking relationships to commercial banks and their depositors when banks underwrite securities. We find lead underwriters’ retail customers benefit as they demand and end up with significantly more of the highly underpriced issues. We find it is actual underpricing beyond that predicted by grey markets that drive the differential demand from the lead bank retail clientele, suggesting that banks pass on information about underpriced initial public offerings to their retail depositors. We analyze banks’ incentives for such behavior and find evidence of banks benefiting through retail cross-selling—both brokerage accounts and consumer loans increase significantly.","['Manju Puri', 'Jörg Rocholl']","['Banking', 'Retail', 'Relationships', 'Cross-selling', 'Underwriting']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X08000457,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,89,2,Manju Puri,2008,168.96141234708878
Big business stability and economic growth: Is what's good for General Motors good for America?,"What is good for a country may not be good for its big businesses, at least recently.

Analyst coverage and earnings management,"What is the role of information intermediaries in corporate governance? This paper examines equity analysts’ influence on managers’ earnings management decisions. Do analysts serve as external monitors to managers, or do they put excessive pressure on managers? Using multiple measures of earnings management, I find that firms followed by more analysts manage their earnings less. To address the potential endogeneity problem of analyst coverage, I use two instrumental variables based on change in broker size and on firm's inclusion in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, and I find that the results are robust. Finally, given the number of covering analysts, analysts from top brokers and more experienced analysts have stronger effects against earnings management.",['Fang (Frank) Yu'],"['Earnings management', 'Financial analyst', 'Corporate governance', 'Analyst coverage']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0800024X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.23345219414006702,88,2,Fang (Frank) Yu,2008,168.96141234708878
Diversification to mitigate expropriation in the tobacco industry,"While it is well established that diversifying acquisitions by large, cash-rich firms destroy shareholder wealth, we document positive abnormal returns to such acquisitions in the tobacco industry. We show that these abnormal returns are associated with proxies for lower expected expropriation costs. Specifically, we show that wealth creation increases in the degree of domestic geographic expansion afforded by the acquisition (increasing tobacco firms’ influence in more political districts) and in the liquidity of tobacco firms’ assets (converting cash to harder-to-expropriate operating assets). We also show that the threat of expropriation constrains payments to shareholders before expropriation becomes certain in 1998.","['Messod D. Beneish', 'Ivo Ph. Jansen', 'Melissa F.

Can hedging tell the full story? Reconciling differences in United States aggregate- and industry-level exchange rate risk premium,"While the importance of currency movements to industry competitiveness is theoretically well established, there is little evidence that currency risk impacts US industries. Applying a conditional asset pricing model to 36 US industries, we find that all industries have a significant currency premium that adds about 2.47 percentage points to the cost of equity and accounts for approximately 11.7% of total risk premium in absolute value. Cross-industry variation in the currency premium is explained by foreign income, industry competitiveness, leverage, liquidity, and other industry characteristics, while its time variation is explained by US aggregate foreign trade, monetary policy, growth opportunities, and other macro variables. The results indicate that methodological weakness, not hedging, explains the insignificant industry currency risk premium found in previous work, thus resolving the puzzle that currency risk premium is important at the aggregate stock market level, but not at the industry level.","['Bill B.

The timing of financing decisions: An examination of the correlation in financing waves,"Why do corporate financing events occur in waves? We challenge recent evidence of the importance of valuation cycles in driving financing waves by documenting that the aggregate pattern of stock repurchases mirrors that of equity issuance and mergers, despite repurchases involving an opposite transaction. We then show that trends in financing decisions result from differing responses to the same economic stimulus: growth in GDP. Specifically, economic expansion reduces the cost of equity relative to the cost of debt, inducing firms to issue equity, and increases cash flow and also causes varying degrees of uncertainty, increasing stock repurchases. We document similar trends and provide similar motivation for merger waves.","['Amy K. Dittmar', 'Robert F.

The economics of conflicts of interest in financial institutions,"A conflict of interest exists when a party to a transaction can gain by taking actions that are detrimental to its counterparty. This paper examines the growing empirical literature on the economics of conflicts of interest in financial institutions. Economic analysis shows that, although conflicts of interest are omnipresent when contracting is costly and parties are imperfectly informed, there are important factors that mitigate their impact and, strikingly, it is possible for customers of financial institutions to benefit from the existence of such conflicts. The empirical literature reaches conclusions that differ across types of conflicts of interest but are overall more ambivalent and certainly more benign than the conclusions drawn by journalists and politicians from mostly anecdotal evidence.","['Hamid Mehran', 'René M.

Conflicts of interest in sell-side research and the moderating role of institutional investors,"Because sell-side analysts are dependent on institutional investors for performance ratings and trading commissions, we argue that analysts are less likely to succumb to investment banking or brokerage pressure in stocks highly visible to institutional investors. Examining a comprehensive sample of analyst recommendations over the 1994–2000 period, we find that analysts’ recommendations relative to consensus are positively associated with investment banking relationships and brokerage pressure but negatively associated with the presence of institutional investor owners. The presence of institutional investors is also associated with more accurate earnings forecasts and more timely re-ratings following severe share price falls.","['Alexander Ljungqvist', 'Felicia Marston', 'Laura T.

Geographical segmentation of US capital markets,"Demographic variation in savings behavior can be exploited to provide evidence on segmentation in US bank loan markets. Cities with a large fraction of seniors have higher volumes of bank deposits. Since many banks rely heavily on deposit financing, this affects local loan supply and economic activity. I show a positive effect of local deposit supply on local outcomes, including the number of firms, the number of manufacturing firms, and the number of new firms started. The effect is stronger in industries that are heavily dependent on external finance. The deregulation of intrastate branching reduced the effect of local deposit supply by approximately a third.",['Bo Becker'],"['Banks', 'Geographical segmentation', 'Seniors']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07000517,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,1,Bo Becker,2007,168.87726821743385
"Investment, consumption, and hedging under incomplete markets","Entrepreneurs often face undiversifiable idiosyncratic risks from their business investments. We extend the standard real options approach to an incomplete markets environment and analyze the joint decisions of business investments, consumption/savings, and portfolio selection. For a lump-sum investment payoff and an agent with a sufficiently strong precautionary savings motive, an increase in volatility can accelerate investment, contrary to the standard real options analysis. When the agent can trade the market portfolio to partially hedge against investment risk, the systematic volatility is compensated via the standard CAPM argument, and the idiosyncratic volatility generates a private equity premium. Finally, when the investment payoff is a series of flows, the agent's idiosyncratic risk exposure alters both the implied option value and the implied project value, causing a reversal of the results in the lump-sum payoff case.","['Jianjun Miao', 'Neng Wang']","['Real options', 'Idiosyncratic risk', 'Hedging', 'Risk aversion', 'Precautionary savings', 'Incomplete markets']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001225,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,86,3,Jianjun Miao,2007,168.87726821743385
Multifrequency news and stock returns,"Equity prices are driven by shocks with persistence levels ranging from intraday horizons to several decades. To accommodate this diversity, we introduce a parsimonious equilibrium model with regime shifts of heterogeneous durations in fundamentals, and estimate specifications with up to 256 states on daily aggregate returns. The multifrequency equilibrium has higher likelihood than the Campbell and Hentschel [1992. No news is good news: an asymmetric model of changing volatility in stock returns.

Our specifications predict 16–20% of the one-quarter-ahead variation in excess stock market returns, and exhibit stable and statistically significant out-of-sample forecasting power.

The evidence also suggests that such obligations are associated with better market quality, but impose significant costs on the specialist.

How much of the corporate bond spread is due to personal taxes?,"Existing term structure models of defaultable bonds have often underestimated corporate bond spreads. A potential problem is that investors’ taxes are ignored in these models. We propose a pricing model that accounts for stochastic default probability and differential tax treatments for discount and premium bonds. By estimating parameters directly from bond data, we obtain significantly positive estimates for the income tax rate of a marginal corporate bond investor after 1986. This contrasts sharply with the previous finding that the implied tax rates for Treasury bonds are close to zero.

Does backdating explain the stock price pattern around executive stock option grants?,"Extant studies show that stock returns are abnormally negative before executive option grants and abnormally positive afterward.

Furthermore, in those cases in which grants are reported within one day of the grant date, the pattern has completely vanished, but it continues to exist for grants reported with longer lags, and its magnitude tends to increase with the reporting delay. We interpret these findings as evidence that most of the abnormal return pattern around option grants is attributable to backdating of option grant dates.","['Randall A.

Foreign entry and bank competition,Foreign entry and bank competition are modeled as the interaction between asymmetrically informed principals: The entrant uses collateral as a screening device to contest the incumbent's informational advantage. Both better information ex ante and stronger legal protection ex post are shown to facilitate the entry of low-cost outside competitors into credit markets. The entrant's success in gaining borrowers of higher quality by offering cheaper loans increases with its efficiency (cost) advantage. This paper accounts for evidence suggesting that foreign banks tend to lend more to large firms thereby neglecting small and medium enterprises.

In contrast, investment bank hold and sell recommendations outperform those of independent research firms by 1.8 basis points daily (412 percentage points annualized).

Bank shareholding alone negatively affects underwriter choice, whereas shareholding together with loans has significantly more positive effects than loans alone.

Productivity-based asset pricing: Theory and evidence,"In a general real business cycle model, we derive a pricing kernel that involves only production function arguments. The productivity shock is the single factor and the capital stock relative to a productivity measure is the conditioning variable. The model compares favorably with the complementary consumption-based and market-based approaches and with the Fama-French three-factor model. A size premium arises from differences in unconditional sensitivities—small firms are more sensitive to productivity shocks—and a value premium from differences in conditional sensitivities to productivity shocks—growth firms are more sensitive to productivity shocks when the productivity risk premium is low.","['Ronald J.

Executive stock options and IPO underpricing,"In about one-third of US IPOs between 1996 and 2000, executives received stock options with an exercise price equal to the IPO offer price rather than a market-determined price. Among firms with such “IPO options”, 58% of top executives realize a net benefit from underpricing: the gain from the options exceeds the loss from the dilution of their pre-IPO shareholdings. If executives can influence either the IPO offer price or the timing and terms of their stock option grants, there should be a positive relation between IPO option grants and underpricing. We find no evidence of such a relation. Our results contrast sharply with the emerging literature on managerial self-dealing at shareholder expense.","['Michelle Lowry', 'Kevin J.

"Arrogance can be a virtue: Overconfidence, information acquisition, and market efficiency","In behavioral finance, overconfidence has been established as a prevalent psychological bias, which can make markets less efficient by creating mispricing in the form of excess volatility and return predictability. In this paper, we develop a model in which overconfidence causes investors to overinvest in information acquisition when this information could improve market efficiency by driving prices closer to true values. We study the impact of overconfidence on mispricing and information acquisition, comparing their net effect on prices. We derive several novel implications. First, overconfidence generally improves market pricing provided the level of overconfidence is not too high. Pricing can also improve even when overconfidence is arbitrarily high, depending on the amount of private information acquired relative to publicly available information.","['K.

Why are IPO investors net buyers through lead underwriters?,"In Nasdaq initial public offerings (IPOs) issued between 1997 and 2002, purchases of lead underwriter clients exceed sales by an amount equal to 8.79% of the total issue. We find that lead underwriter clients do not buy to build larger long-term positions, capitalize on superior execution quality, or because of clientele effects. However, characteristics of net buying that are at odds with these explanations and other behaviors (like institutional purchases of cold IPOs) are all consistent with lead underwriters engaging in quid pro quo arrangements with clients. Price contribution analysis shows that such client buying activity contributes significantly to first-day price increases.","['John M. Griffin', 'Jeffrey H.

Foreign currency-denominated borrowing in the absence of operating incentives,"It is well known that corporations issue foreign currency-denominated debt to hedge foreign currency cash flows with offsetting interest payments. We test an alternative “opportunistic” motive for foreign currency-denominated borrowing. We do so by constructing a comprehensive sample of foreign currency-denominated bonds issued by sovereign government and agency issuers with no foreign currency cash flows or foreign operations. We find strong and consistent evidence that the borrowers in our sample consider cross-currency differences in covered and uncovered interest yields in choosing the currency in which to denominate their international debt. We estimate the average gains to opportunistic covered yield borrowing to be 4 to 18 basis points. Interestingly, we also find that the average bond offering in our sample precedes a large and beneficial depreciation of the issue currency over the course of the following year.

Dealer intermediation and price behavior in the aftermarket for new bond issues,"Municipal bonds trade in decentralized broker-dealer markets, and are underpriced when issued, but unlike equities the average price rises slowly over several days.

An analysis of trade-size clustering and its relation to stealth trading,"NYSE and Nasdaq trades increasingly cluster on multiples of 500, 1,000, and 5,000 shares. Such clustering varies over time and across stocks, and tends to increase with the level of trading activity. Furthermore, rounded trades tend to have more persistence both in occurrence and in trade initiation. Finally, medium-sized rounded trades tend to have greater relative price impact than large rounded trades. From these observations we surmise that trade-size clustering is consistent, at least in part, with the actions of stealth traders who tend to use medium-sized rounded transactions in an attempt to disguise their trades.","['Gordon J.

Do mutual funds time the market? Evidence from portfolio holdings,"Previous research finds insignificant market-timing ability for mutual funds using tests based on fund returns. The return-based tests, however, are subject to the “artificial timing” bias. In this paper, we propose and implement new measures of market timing based on mutual fund holdings. Our holdings-based measures do not suffer from the artificial timing bias. We find that, on average, actively managed U.S. domestic equity funds have positive timing ability. Market timing funds use non-public information to predict market returns, tend to have high industry concentration, large fund size, a tilt toward small-cap stocks, and are active in industry rotation.","['George J.

The risk return tradeoff in the long run: 1836–2003,"Previous studies typically find a statistically insignificant relation between the market risk premium and its expected volatility. Further, several of these studies estimate a negative risk return tradeoff, contrary to the predictions of mainstream theory. Using simulations, I demonstrate that even 100 years of data constitute a small sample that may easily lead to this finding even though the true risk return tradeoff is positive. Small-sample inference is plagued by the fact that conditional volatility has almost no explanatory power for realized returns. Using the nearly two century history of U.S. equity market returns from Schwert [1990. Indexes of United States stock prices from 1802 to 1987. Journal of Business 63, 399–426], I estimate a positive and statistically significant risk return tradeoff.

The influence of product market dynamics on a firm's cash holdings and hedging behavior,"Prior work suggests that if a firm shares a larger proportion of its growth opportunities with rivals, an inability to fully invest in these opportunities leads to predatory behavior on the part of rivals and losses in market share. We examine whether firms manage this predation risk. We find inter- and intra-industry evidence that the extent of the interdependence of a firm's investment opportunities with rivals is positively associated with its use of derivatives and the size of its cash holdings. Moreover, an analysis of investment behavior provides evidence that if this interdependence is high, the management of predation risk provides strategic benefits. Our results indicate that predation risk is an important determinant of corporate financial policy choices and investment behavior.","['David Haushalter', 'Sandy Klasa', 'William F.

Asymmetric stock market volatility and the cyclical behavior of expected returns,"Recent explanations of aggregate stock market fluctuations suggest that countercyclical stock market volatility is consistent with rational asset evaluations. In this paper, I develop a framework to study the causes of countercyclical stock market volatility. I find that countercyclical risk premia do not imply countercyclical return volatility. Instead, countercyclical stock volatility occurs if risk premia increase more in bad times than they decrease in good times, thereby inducing price–dividend ratios to fluctuate more in bad times than in good. The business cycle asymmetry in the investors’ attitude toward discounting future cash flows plays a novel and critical role in many rational explanations of asset price fluctuations.",['Antonio Mele'],"['Countercyclical volatility', 'Countercyclical price-sensitivity', 'Risk-adjusted discount rates', 'Pricing-kernel restrictions']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001183,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,86,2,Antonio Mele,2007,168.87726821743385
Are small investors naive about incentives?,"Security analysts tend to bias stock recommendations upward, particularly if they are affiliated with the underwriter. We analyze how investors account for such distortions. Using the NYSE Trades and Quotations database, we find that large traders adjust their trading response downward. While they exert buy pressure following strong buy recommendations, they display no reaction to buy recommendations and selling pressure following hold recommendations. This “discounting” is even more pronounced when the analyst is affiliated with the underwriter. Small traders, instead, follow recommendations literally. They exert positive pressure following both buy and strong buy recommendations and zero pressure following hold recommendations. We discuss possible explanations for the differences in trading response, including information costs and investor naiveté.","['Ulrike Malmendier', 'Devin Shanthikumar']","['Stock recommendations', 'Trade reaction', 'Individual and institutional investors', 'Conflicts of interest', 'Behavioral finance']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07000621,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,2,Ulrike Malmendier,2007,168.87726821743385
Do managers intentionally use repurchase tender offers to signal private information? Evidence from firm financial reporting behavior,"Signaling is the most commonly cited explanation for stock repurchases in the academic literature. Yet, there is little evidence on whether managers intentionally use repurchases as signaling devices. Using a firm's financial reporting behavior to infer managerial intent, we find evidence suggesting that managers intentionally use fixed-price repurchase tender offers to signal undervaluation. In contrast, we find no evidence that managers use Dutch-auction tender offers to signal undervaluation. Instead, firms engaging in Dutch-auction repurchases act as if they are trying to deflate their earnings prior to the repurchases to further reduce the repurchasing price.","['Henock Louis', 'Hal White']","['Repurchase tender offers', 'Signaling', 'Managerial opportunism', 'Financial reporting']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07000566,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,1,Henock Louis,2007,168.87726821743385

Do asset prices reflect fundamentals?

In contrast, we show that when theory clearly identifies the fundamental, e.g., at temperatures close to or below freezing, a close link exists between FCOJ prices and that fundamental. Using a simple, theoretically motivated, nonlinear, state dependent model, we can explain approximately 50% of the return variation on days with freezing temperatures. Moreover, while these observations represent less than 4.5% of the winter sample, they account for two-thirds of the entire winter return variability.","['Jacob Boudoukh', 'Matthew Richardson', 'YuQing (Jeff) Shen', 'Robert F.

Investor protection and the Coasian view,"The corporate charters of a sample of Mexican firms show that private firms often significantly enhance the legal protection offered to investors, but public firms rarely do so. We construct a model that endogenizes the degree of investor protection that firms provide, using as a springboard the assumption that legal regimes differ in their ability to enforce precisely filtering contracts that provide protection only in those cases where expropriation can occur. Our model generates predictions about the types of contracts that would be employed and the levels of investor protection that would prevail across different legal regimes in both private and public firms.","['Nittai K.

Trials comparing several techniques in the literature, adapted from standard lattice, grid and Monte Carlo methods to tackle particular types of problem, show that QUAD offers far greater flexibility, superior convergence, and hence, increased accuracy and considerably reduced computational times. The speed advantage of QUAD means that, even under the curse of dimensionality, it is not necessary to resort to Monte Carlo methods (certainly for options involving up to five underlying assets). Given the universality and flexibility of the method, it should be the method of choice for pricing options involving multiple underlying assets, in the presence of many features, such as early exercise or path dependency.","['Ari D.

Business ties and proxy voting by mutual funds,"The magnitude of mutual funds’ business ties with their portfolio firms is documented and is linked to funds’ proxy votes at specific firms and to overall voting practices. Aggregate votes at the fund family level indicate a positive relation between business ties and the propensity to vote with management. Votes at specific firms, however, reveal that funds are no more likely to vote with management of client firms than of non-clients. Because the votes took place when funds knew their votes would be publicly scrutinized, fund families with a larger client base may have adopted voting policies that led to less frequent opposition to management at all firms.","['Gerald F.

In this paper, we investigate under what conditions non-informational heterogeneity, i.e., differences in preferences and endowments, leads to nontrivial trading volume in equilibrium. We present a non-informational no-trade theorem that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for zero equilibrium trading volume in a continuous-time Lucas market model with heterogeneous agents, multiple goods, and multiple securities. We explain in detail how no-trade equilibria are related to autarky equilibria, portfolio autarky equilibria, and peculiar financial market equilibria, which play an important role in the literature on international risk sharing.","['Tony Berrada', 'Julien Hugonnier', 'Marcel Rindisbacher']","['Trading volume', 'No-trade equilibrium', 'Portfolio autarky equilibrium', 'Peculiar equilibrium', 'International finance']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06002078,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,3,Tony Berrada,2007,168.87726821743385
Employee sentiment and stock option compensation,"The use of equity-based compensation for rank-and-file employees is a puzzle. We analyze whether the popularity of option compensation may be driven by employee optimism, and show that optimism by itself is insufficient to make option compensation optimal. The crucial insight is that firms compete with financial markets as suppliers of equity to employees and that employees’ access to the equity market restricts firms’ ability to profit from employee optimism. Firms must be able to extract some of the implied rents even though employees can purchase company equity in the financial markets. Such rent extraction becomes feasible if employees prefer the stock options offered by firms to the equity offered by the market, or if the traded equity is overvalued. We provide empirical evidence that firms use broad-based option compensation when boundedly rational employees are likely to be excessively optimistic about company stock, and when employees are likely to strictly prefer options over stock.","['Nittai K.

We use disaggregated trade data to develop a measure of a country's external finance need of exports, and demonstrate this effect empirically.

"Housing, consumption and asset pricing","This paper considers a consumption-based asset pricing model where housing is explicitly modeled both as an asset and as a consumption good. Nonseparable preferences describe households’ concern with composition risk, that is, fluctuations in the relative share of housing in their consumption basket. Since the housing share moves slowly, a concern with composition risk induces low frequency movements in stock prices that are not driven by news about cash flow. Moreover, the model predicts that the housing share can be used to forecast excess returns on stocks. We document that this indeed true in the data. The presence of composition risk also implies that the riskless rate is low which further helps the model improve on the standard CCAPM.","['Monika Piazzesi', 'Martin Schneider', 'Selale Tuzel']","['Housing', 'Real estate', 'Consumption-based asset pricing', 'Return predictability']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06002005,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,3,Monika Piazzesi,2007,168.87726821743385
"Banking crises, financial dependence, and growth","This paper contributes to the literature that analyzes the mechanisms linking financial shocks and real activity. In particular, we investigate the growth impact of banking crises on industries with different levels of dependence on external finance. If banks are the key institutions allowing credit constraints to be relaxed, then a sudden loss of these intermediaries in a system in which such intermediaries are important should have a disproportionately contractionary impact on the sectors that flourished due to their reliance on banks. Using data from 38 developed and developing countries that experienced financial crises during the last quarter century, we find that those sectors that are highly dependent on external finance tend to experience a substantially greater contraction of value added during a banking crisis in countries with deeper financial systems than in countries with shallower financial systems. Our results do not suggest, however, that on net the externally dependent firms fare worse in deep financial systems.","['Randall S.

Further, we show that firm characteristics explain almost none of the variation in governance ratings in less-developed countries and that access to global capital markets sharpens firms’ incentives for better governance.","['Craig Doidge', 'G.

We examine a sample of 334 banks (representing 80% of global bank equity) in 28 countries around five global financial crises. Our results suggest statistically significant, but economically small, increases in systemic risk. Although policy responses are endogenous, the low estimated probabilities suggest that the distress of central bankers, regulators and politicians about the events we study could be overstated and that current policy responses to financial crises could be adequate to handle major macroeconomic events.","['Söhnke M.

The price of corporate liquidity: Acquisition discounts for unlisted targets,"This paper documents average acquisition discounts for stand-alone private firms and subsidiaries of other firms (unlisted targets) of 15% to 30% relative to acquisition multiples for comparable publicly traded targets. My results are strongly consistent with the notion that sale prices for unlisted targets are affected by both the need for, and availability of, the liquidity provided by the buyer. Corporate parents are significantly liquidity-constrained prior to the sale of a subsidiary, particularly when the subsidiary is being sold for cash. Furthermore, acquisition discounts are significantly greater when debt capital is relatively more expensive to obtain, and when the parent firm has below-market stock returns in the 12 months prior to the sale.",['Micah S.

Portfolio manager ownership and fund performance,"This paper documents the range of portfolio manager ownership in the funds they manage and examines whether higher ownership is associated with improved future performance. Almost half of all managers have ownership stakes in their funds, though the absolute investment is modest. Future risk-adjusted performance is positively related to managerial ownership, with performance improving by about 3 basis points for each basis point of managerial ownership. These findings persist after controlling for various measures of fund board effectiveness. Fund manager ownership is higher in funds with better past performance, lower front-end loads, smaller size, longer managerial tenure, and funds affiliated with smaller families. It is also higher in funds with higher board member compensation and in equity funds relative to bond funds. Future performance is positively related to the component of ownership that can be predicted by other variables, as well as the unpredictable component. Our findings support the notion that managerial ownership has desirable incentive alignment attributes for mutual fund investors and indicate that the disclosure of this information is useful in making portfolio allocation decisions.","['Ajay Khorana', 'Henri Servaes', 'Lei Wedge']","['Mutual funds', 'Managerial ownership', 'Fund governance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07000530,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,1,Ajay Khorana,2007,168.87726821743385
Informed finance and technological change: Evidence from credit relationships,"This paper empirically investigates the effect of “informed finance” on technological change. The theoretical literature offers conflicting predictions on whether the information of financiers fosters or inhibits firms’ innovation. Using data from a sample of Italian manufacturing firms, we find that the information of firms’ main banks, proxied by the duration of credit relationships, promotes innovation. This positive effect is economically and statistically more significant for product than for process innovations. Nonetheless, the role of relationship banks in innovation is quite unsophisticated: they do not foster internal research but rather fund the relevant investments that the introduction and acquisition of new technologies entails.","['Ana Maria Herrera', 'Raoul Minetti']","['Banks', 'Credit relationships', 'Technological change']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06001401,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,1,Ana Maria Herrera,2007,168.87726821743385

Firms’ histories and their capital structures,"This paper examines how cash flows, investment expenditures, and stock price histories affect debt ratios. Consistent with earlier work, we find that these variables have a substantial influence on changes in capital structure. Specifically, stock price changes and financial deficits (i.e., the amount of external capital raised) have strong influences on capital structure changes, but in contrast to previous conclusions, we find that over long horizons their effects are partially reversed. These results indicate that although firms’ histories strongly influence their capital structures, over time their capital structures tend to move towards target debt ratios that are consistent with the tradeoff theories of capital structure.","['Ayla Kayhan', 'Sheridan Titman']","['Target capital structure', 'Market timing', 'Pecking order', 'Financial deficit']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06001437,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,1,Ayla Kayhan,2007,168.87726821743385
Asset fire sales (and purchases) in equity markets,"This paper examines institutional price pressure in equity markets by studying mutual fund transactions caused by capital flows from 1980 to 2004. Funds experiencing large outflows tend to decrease existing positions, which creates price pressure in the securities held in common by distressed funds. Similarly, the tendency among funds experiencing large inflows to expand existing positions creates positive price pressure in overlapping holdings. Investors who trade against constrained mutual funds earn significant returns for providing liquidity. In addition, future flow-driven transactions are predictable, creating an incentive to front-run the anticipated forced trades by funds experiencing extreme capital flows.","['Joshua Coval', 'Erik Stafford']","['Mutual fund flows', 'Liquidity', 'Price pressure']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001158,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,86,2,Joshua Coval,2007,168.87726821743385
Banks and bubbles: How good are bankers at spotting winners?,"This paper examines the bank lending relations of a large sample of technology and nontechnology firms that went public during the 1996–2000 period. We use a unique hand-collected data set to examine the characteristics of firms that establish pre- Initial Public Offering (IPO) bank lending relations and whether post-IPO performance is related to the existence and size of pre-IPO banking relations. We find that the majority of IPO firms have banking relations before they go public. Firms with banking relations are older, more profitable or, in the case of tech firms, have lower losses, and are more likely to have funding from venture capitalists than firms without banking relations. We also find that banks lent aggressively to technology firms in the sense that current earnings and cash flows were significantly less important in determining banking relations for technology firms than for nontechnology firms. Consistent with the importance of so-called soft information in lending decisions, we find that, controlling for ex ante observable risk measures, there is a positive and significant relation between improvements in post-IPO operating performance and the existence and size of pre-IPO banking relations. Overall, our results indicate that firms with the best current and future prospects establish banking relations. Our findings provide an explanation as to why investors could interpret lending relations as a positive signal of firm quality.","['Laura Gonzalez', 'Christopher James']","['Bank', 'Bank lending', 'Venture capital', 'Initial public offerings']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07000888,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,86,1,Laura Gonzalez,2007,168.87726821743385
Firm-specific attributes and the cross-section of momentum,"This paper identifies observable firm-specific attributes that drive momentum.

We use these insights to implement momentum strategies (buying winners and selling losers) with both numerically simulated returns and CRSP/Compustat data.

Is there a diversification discount in financial conglomerates?,"This paper investigates whether the diversity of activities conducted by financial institutions influences their market valuations. We find that there is a diversification discount: The market values of financial conglomerates that engage in multiple activities, e.g., lending and non-lending financial services, are lower than if those financial conglomerates were broken into financial intermediaries that specialize in the individual activities. While difficult to identify a single causal factor, the results are consistent with theories that stress intensified agency problems in financial conglomerates engaged in multiple activities and indicate that economies of scope are not sufficiently large to produce a diversification premium.","['Luc Laeven', 'Ross Levine']","['Corporate diversification', 'Banking', 'Economies of scope', 'Agency costs']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05002217,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,2,Luc Laeven,2007,168.87726821743385
Reaching out: Access to and use of banking services across countries,"This paper is a first attempt at measuring financial sector outreach and investigating its determinants. First, we present new indicators of banking sector outreach across 99 countries, constructed from aggregate data provided by bank regulators. Second, we show that our indicators closely predict harder-to-collect micro-level statistics of household and firm use of banking services, and are associated with measures of firm financing obstacles in the expected way. Finally, we explore the association between our outreach indicators and standard determinants of financial sector depth.

Share restrictions and asset pricing: Evidence from the hedge fund industry,"This paper presents evidence on the relation between hedge fund returns and restrictions imposed by funds that limit the liquidity of fund investors. The excess returns of funds with lockup restrictions are approximately 4–7% per year higher than those of nonlockup funds. The average alpha of all funds is negative or insignificant after controlling for lockups and other share restrictions. Also, a negative relation is found between share restrictions and the liquidity of the fund's portfolio. This suggests that share restrictions allow funds to efficiently manage illiquid assets, and these benefits are captured by investors as a share illiquidity premium.",['George O.

Credit-spread determinants and interlocking contracts: A study of the Ras Gas project,"This paper provides an in-depth study of the allocation of a firm's residual risks not explicitly managed through interlocking contracts in the context of project finance. Focusing on the Ras Gas project, we relate its credit spreads as a measure of investor risk perceptions to firm-specific risk factors in the context of 25-year supply agreements, debt covenants, and a debt-service guarantee contingent on output prices. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that unmanaged risk factors affecting the supply agreement drive Ras Gas’ credit spreads, whereas managed ones have no effect. Interpreting our findings as evidence for the nexus-of-contracts view of the firm, we discuss some implications for financial design and valuation.","['Mansoor Dailami', 'Robert Hauswald']","['Credit spreads', 'Project finance', 'Nexus of contracts', 'Contractual incompleteness']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001080,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,86,1,Mansoor Dailami,2007,168.87726821743385
"Classified boards, firm value, and managerial entrenchment","This paper shows that classified boards destroy value by entrenching management and reducing director effectiveness. First, I show that classified boards are associated with a significant reduction in firm value and that this holds even among complex firms, although such firms are often regarded as most likely to benefit from staggered board elections. I then examine how classified boards entrench management by focusing on CEO turnover, executive compensation, proxy contests, and shareholder proposals. My results indicate that classified boards significantly insulate management from market discipline, thus suggesting that the observed reduction in value is due to managerial entrenchment and diminished board accountability.",['Olubunmi Faleye'],"['Classified boards', 'Managerial entrenchment', 'Executive compensation']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06001942,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,2,Olubunmi Faleye,2007,168.87726821743385
Trade credit and bank credit: Evidence from recent financial crises,"This paper studies the effect of financial crises on trade credit for a sample of 890 firms in six emerging economies. Although the provision of trade credit increases right after a crisis, it contracts in the following months and years. Firms that are financially more vulnerable to crises extend less trade credit to their customers. We argue that the decline in aggregate trade credit ratios is driven by the reduction in the supply of trade credit that follows a bank credit crunch, consistent with the “redistribution view” of trade credit provision, whereby bank credit is redistributed via trade credit from financially stronger firms to weaker firms.","['Inessa Love', 'Lorenzo A.

We find strong evidence of contagion effects for Chapter 11 bankruptcies and competition effects for Chapter 7 bankruptcies. We also introduce a purely unanticipated event, in the form of a large jump in a company's CDS spread, and find that this leads to the strongest evidence of credit contagion across the industry.

SV mixture models with application to S&P 500 index returns,"Understanding both the dynamics of volatility and the shape of the distribution of returns conditional on the volatility state is important for many financial applications. A simple single-factor stochastic volatility model appears to be sufficient to capture most of the dynamics. It is the shape of the conditional distribution that is the problem. This paper examines the idea of modeling this distribution as a discrete mixture of normals. The flexibility of this class of distributions provides a transparent look into the tails of the returns distribution. Model diagnostics suggest that the model, SV-mix, does a good job of capturing the salient features of the data.

Do today's trades affect tomorrow's IPO allocations?,"Underwriters using bookbuilding can allocate shares of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the basis of, among other things, commissions paid by investors. In testing the hypothesis that investors trade liquid stocks in order to affect their IPO allocations, we find that money left on the table by IPOs is related to the trading volume of the 50 most liquid stocks near the offer date. For an IPO that leaves $1 billion on the table, there is abnormal volume of 2.7% to 4.1% in the 50 most liquid stocks over the six days ending on the day that trading commences in that IPO, although only during the internet bubble period is this volume increase statistically significant.","['M.

Why do firms hold so much cash? A tax-based explanation,"US corporations hold significant amounts of cash on their balance sheets. This paper develops and tests the hypothesis that the magnitude of US multinational cash holdings are, in part, a consequence of the tax costs associated with repatriating foreign income. Consistent with this hypothesis, firms facing higher repatriation taxes hold higher levels of cash, hold this cash abroad, and hold this cash in affiliates that trigger high tax costs when repatriating earnings. In addition, less financially constrained firms and those that are more technology intensive exhibit a higher sensitivity of affiliate cash holdings to repatriation tax burdens.","['C.

The effect of state laws on capital structure,"US manufacturing firms incorporated in states with stronger payout restrictions use less debt, while antitakeover statutes do not significantly reduce long-run leverage. Correcting for the endogenously determined choice of where to incorporate, we find that firms sort themselves according to state laws and capital structure needs. After accounting for self-selection, state antitakeover laws are positively associated with debt as a fraction of market value, possibly due to lower market values for these firms. Payout restrictions appear to reduce leverage for firms that have not reincorporated outside their home states. These constraints explain part of the negative relation between profitability and leverage.","['John K. Wald', 'Michael S.

Investment banking deal flow is related to analyst reputation only for equity transactions. For debt and M&A transactions, analyst reputation does not matter.

The determinants of corporate board size and composition: An empirical analysis,"Using a unique panel dataset that tracks corporate board development from a firm's IPO through 10 years later, we find that: (i) board size and independence increase as firms grow and diversify over time; (ii) board size—but not board independence—reflects a tradeoff between the firm-specific benefits and costs of monitoring; and (iii) board independence is negatively related to the manager's influence and positively related to constraints on that influence. These results indicate that economic considerations—in particular, the specific nature of the firm's competitive environment and managerial team—help explain cross-sectional variation in corporate board size and composition. Nonetheless, much of the variation in board structures remains unexplained, suggesting that idiosyncratic factors affect many individual boards’ characteristics.","['Audra L.

Does industry-wide distress affect defaulted firms? Evidence from creditor recoveries,"Using data on defaulted firms in the United States over the period 1982–1999, we show that creditors of defaulted firms recover significantly lower amounts in present-value terms when the industry of defaulted firms is in distress. We investigate whether this is purely an economic-downturn effect or also a fire-sales effect along the lines of Shleifer and Vishny [1992. Liquidation values and debt capacity: a market equilibrium approach. Journal of Finance 47, 1343–1366]. We find the fire-sales effect to be also at work: Creditors recover less if the industry is in distress and non-defaulted firms in the industry are illiquid, particularly if the industry is characterized by assets that are specific, that is, not easily redeployable by other industries, and if the debt is collateralized by such specific assets. The interaction effect of industry-level distress and asset-specificity is strongest for senior unsecured creditors, is economically significant, and robust to contract-specific, firm-specific, macroeconomic, and bond-market supply effects. We also document that defaulted firms in distressed industries are more likely to emerge as restructured firms than to be acquired or liquidated, and spend longer time in bankruptcy.","['Viral V.

Determinants of the floating-to-fixed rate debt structure of firms,"We analyze the effects of managerial incentive, firm characteristics and market timing on floating-to-fixed rate debt structure of firms. We find that chief financial officer's (CFO's), not chief executive officer's (CEO's), incentive has a strong influence on firm's debt structure. When CFOs have incentives to increase (decrease) firm risk, firms obtain volatility-increasing (-decreasing) debt structure. These effects are present only for CFOs who are not subject to high monitoring by board members, CEOs, or corporate control market.

Corporate financing decisions when investors take the path of least resistance,"We argue that inertial behavior on the part of investors can have significant consequences for corporate financial policy. One implication of investor inertia is that it improves the terms for the acquiring firm in a stock-for-stock merger, because acquirer shares are placed in the hands of investors, who, independent of their beliefs, do not resell these shares on the open market. In the presence of a downward-sloping demand curve, this leads to a reduction in price pressure and, hence, to cheaper equity financing. We develop a simple model to illustrate this idea and present supporting empirical evidence.","['Malcolm Baker', 'Joshua Coval', 'Jeremy C.

A lender-based theory of collateral,"We consider an imperfectly competitive loan market in which a local relationship lender has an information advantage vis-à-vis distant transaction lenders. Competitive pressure from the transaction lenders prevents the local lender from extracting the full surplus from projects. As a result, the local lender inefficiently rejects marginally profitable projects. Collateral mitigates the inefficiency by increasing the local lender's payoff from precisely those marginally profitable projects that she inefficiently rejects. The model predicts that, controlling for observable borrower risk, collateralized loans are more likely to default ex post, which is consistent with the empirical evidence. The model also predicts that borrowers for whom local lenders have a relatively smaller information advantage face higher collateral requirements, and that technological innovations that narrow the information advantage of local lenders, such as small business credit scoring, lead to a greater use of collateral in lending relationships.","['Roman Inderst', 'Holger M.

The firm invests and saves optimally facing convex costs of external equity, overhang from outstanding debt, and collateral constraints on new borrowing. Overhang and costs of external equity discourage investment. Conversely, firms anticipating collateral constraints experience a side benefit from investing as installed capital relaxes future constraints. Empirical tests support the model. Conditional on average Q, investment is lower for equity issuers and for firms with large debt overhang. The Kaplan and Zingales and the Whited and Wu indices are used as proxies for future collateral constraints.

Maximum likelihood estimation of stochastic volatility models,"We develop and implement a method for maximum likelihood estimation in closed-form of stochastic volatility models. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compare a full likelihood procedure, where an option price is inverted into the unobservable volatility state, to an approximate likelihood procedure where the volatility state is replaced by proxies based on the implied volatility of a short-dated at-the-money option. The approximation results in a small loss of accuracy relative to the standard errors due to sampling noise. We apply this method to market prices of index options for several stochastic volatility models, and compare the characteristics of the estimated models. The evidence for a general CEV model, which nests both the affine Heston model and a GARCH model, suggests that the elasticity of variance of volatility lies between that assumed by the two nested models.","['Yacine Aı¨t-Sahalia', 'Robert Kimmel']","['Closed-form likelihood expansions', 'Volatility proxies', 'Heston model', 'GARCH model', 'CEV model']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06001395,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,2,Yacine Aı¨t-Sahalia,2007,168.87726821743385
Why are IPOs underpriced? Evidence from Japan's hybrid auction-method offerings,"We document discretionary underpricing and partial adjustment of IPO prices in the public offer tranche of Japan's hybrid auction regime, in which investor information differences are not important, there are no roadshows, preferential allocations are negligible, institutional investing is low, and the public offer tranche cannot fail. The magnitude and variation of underpricing in our sample, which spans relatively hot and cold markets, are similar to those reported for US IPOs. The evidence is most consistent with underpricing arising from an implicit contract to allocate risk related to initial mispricing where, in exchange for guaranteeing a minimum price, the underwriter participates indirectly in upside performance. The results raise important questions about interpretations of IPO underpricing in the US.","['Frank Kerins', 'Kenji Kutsuna', 'Richard Smith']","['IPO', 'Public offering', 'Book building', 'Underpricing', 'Partial adjustment']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07000578,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,3,Frank Kerins,2007,168.87726821743385
Is Chapter 11 costly?,"We examine a sample of 459 firms filing for Chapter 11 during the period 1991–1998 and find that our sample firms experience significant improvements in their operating performance during Chapter 11. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that Chapter 11, if anything, provides net benefits to bankrupt firms. In the cross section, firms with higher debt ratios experience greater improvements in operating performance, and the complexity of the renegotiation process negatively affects the improvement. We find no relationship between Chapter 11 outcome and changes in risk-adjusted firm value in Chapter 11.","['Avner Kalay', 'Rajeev Singhal', 'Elizabeth Tashjian']","['Indirect bankruptcy costs', 'Chapter 11']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06002200,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,84,3,Avner Kalay,2007,168.87726821743385
Affiliated mutual funds and the allocation of initial public offerings,"We examine how investment banks use initial public offerings (IPOs) in relation to their affiliated mutual funds. The dumping ground hypothesis predicts that the lead underwriter allocates cold IPOs to its affiliated funds so that more deals can be completed when demand for these IPOs is weak. Affiliated funds could also receive more cold IPOs because the lead underwriter uses allocations of hot IPOs to unaffiliated funds to gain trading commission business. The nepotism hypothesis predicts that the lead underwriter allocates hot IPOs to its affiliated funds to boost their performance and thus attract more money. We find little evidence supporting the dumping ground hypothesis, although some evidence supports the nepotism hypothesis, especially during the internet bubble period of 1999–2000.","['Jay R.

Is universal banking justified? Evidence from bank underwriting of corporate bonds in Japan,"We examine the extent to which universal banking in Japan creates conflicts of interest. We find that as banks enter the securities business, they discount the price of the corporate bonds they underwrite significantly in an effort to attract investors, thereby generating conflicts of interest that are harmful to issuers. Further, we find that close prior lending relationships between banks and their client issuers is the driving force behind such conflicts and that competition from investment houses limits but does not eliminate these conflicts. Our results contrast sharply with the evidence for the US, which largely shows a certification role for banks.","['Jun-Koo Kang', 'Wei-Lin Liu']","['Universal banking', 'Certification', 'Conflicts of interest', 'Underwriting', 'Japanese main bank']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06002108,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,84,1,Jun-Koo Kang,2007,168.87726821743385
Disclosure frequency and earnings management,"We examine the relation between disclosure frequency and earnings management, and the impact of this relation on post-issue performance, for a sample of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). We contend that firms with extensive disclosure are less likely to face information problems, leading to less earnings management and better post-issue performance. Our results confirm that disclosure frequency is inversely related to earnings management and positively associated with post-issue performance. We also find that transparency-reducing disclosure is concentrated in firms that substantially, but temporarily, increase disclosure prior to the offering. Such firms exhibit more earnings management and poorer post-SEO stock performance, on average.","['Hoje Jo', 'Yongtae Kim']","['Seasoned equity offerings', 'Earnings management', 'Disclosure frequency', 'Post-issue performance']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06002169,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,84,2,Hoje Jo,2007,168.87726821743385
Market price of risk specifications for affine models: Theory and evidence,"We extend the standard specification of the market price of risk for affine yield models, and apply it to U.S. Treasury data. Our specification often provides better fit, sometimes with very high statistical significance. The improved fit comes from the time-series rather than cross-sectional features of the yield curve. We derive conditions under which our specification does not admit arbitrage opportunities. The extension has extremely strong statistical significance for affine yield models with multiple square-root type variables. Although we focus on affine yield models, our specification can be used with other asset pricing models as well.","['Patrick Cheridito', 'Damir Filipović', 'Robert L.

Private credit in 129 countries,"We investigate cross-country determinants of private credit, using new data on legal creditor rights and private and public credit registries in 129 countries. Both creditor protection through the legal system and information-sharing institutions are associated with higher ratios of private credit to gross domestic product, but the former is relatively more important in the richer countries. An analysis of legal reforms shows that credit rises after improvements in creditor rights and in information sharing. Creditor rights are remarkably stable over time, contrary to the hypothesis that legal rules are converging. Finally, legal origins are an important determinant of both creditor rights and information-sharing institutions. The analysis suggests that public credit registries, which are primarily a feature of French civil law countries, benefit private credit markets in developing countries.","['Simeon Djankov', 'Caralee McLiesh', 'Andrei Shleifer']","['Debt', 'Legal origin', 'Investor protection']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06002170,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,84,2,Simeon Djankov,2007,168.87726821743385
Corporate governance and the value of cash holdings,"We investigate how corporate governance impacts firm value by comparing the value and use of cash holdings in poorly and well-governed firms. We show that governance has a substantial impact on value through its impact on cash: $1.00 of cash in a poorly governed firm is valued at only $0.42 to $0.88. Good governance approximately doubles this value. Furthermore, we show that firms with poor corporate governance dissipate cash quickly in ways that significantly reduce operating performance. This negative impact of large cash holdings on future operating performance is cancelled out if the firm is well governed.","['Amy Dittmar', 'Jan Mahrt-Smith']","['Cash holdings', 'Corporate governance', 'Ownership structure', 'Take-over provisions', 'Firm value']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06001978,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,3,Amy Dittmar,2007,168.87726821743385
Local ownership as private information: Evidence on the monitoring-liquidity trade-off,"We investigate how ownership patterns affect the way the firm is monitored, the liquidity of its shares, and its stock price. We show that informed ownership improves governance and induces value-enhancing decisions (less over-investment and fewer but better acquisitions). At the same time, it increases the adverse selection discount required by less informed investors to trade, reducing the firm's liquidity. Both effects are impounded in the stock price. This explains why ownership seems to be unrelated to performance. Informed investors affect prices in opposite directions: monitoring would raise prices, but the lower liquidity induced by their presence would reduce them.","['Jose-Miguel Gaspar', 'Massimo Massa']","['Local ownership', 'Corporate governance', 'Liquidity', 'Monitoring', 'Mutual funds', 'Private information']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06002030,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,3,Jose-Miguel Gaspar,2007,168.87726821743385
Affiliated firms and financial support: Evidence from Indian business groups,"We investigate the functioning of internal capital markets in Indian Business Groups. We document that intragroup loans are an important means of transferring cash across group firms and are typically used to support financially weaker firms. Evidence suggests that an important reason for providing support may be to avoid default by a group firm and consequent negative spillovers to the rest of the group. Consistent with such spillovers, the first bankruptcy in a group is followed by significant drops in external financing, investments and profits of other firms in the group and an increase in their bankruptcy probability.","['Radhakrishnan Gopalan', 'Vikram Nanda', 'Amit Seru']","['Business groups', 'Reputation', 'Spillovers', 'Intragroup loans', 'Financial distress']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001341,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,86,3,Radhakrishnan Gopalan,2007,168.87726821743385
Why do corporate managers misstate financial statements? The role of option compensation and other factors,"We investigate the incentives that led to the rash of restated financial statements at the end of the 1990s market bubble. We find that the likelihood of a misstated financial statement increases greatly when the CEO has very sizable holdings of in-the-money stock options. Misstatements are also more likely for firms that are constrained by an interest-coverage debt covenant, that raise new debt or equity capital, or that have a CEO who serves as board chair. Our results indicate that agency costs increased [Jensen, M.C., 2005a, Agency costs of overvalued equity.

Corporate capital structure and the characteristics of suppliers and customers,"We investigate the link between a firm's leverage and the characteristics of its suppliers and customers. Specifically, we examine whether firms use decreased leverage as a commitment mechanism to induce suppliers/customers to undertake relationship-specific investments. We find that the firm's leverage is negatively related to the R&D intensities of its suppliers and customers. We also find lower debt levels for firms operating in industries in which strategic alliances and joint ventures with firms in supplier and customer industries are more prevalent. Consistent with a bargaining role for debt, we find a positive relation between firm debt level and the degree of concentration in supplier/customer industries.","['Jayant R.

"Financial fraud, director reputation, and shareholder wealth","We investigate the reputational impact of financial fraud for outside directors based on a sample of firms facing shareholder class action lawsuits. Following a financial fraud lawsuit, outside directors do not face abnormal turnover on the board of the sued firm but experience a significant decline in other board seats held. This decline in other directorships is greater for more severe allegations of fraud and when the outside director bears greater responsibility for monitoring fraud. Interlocked firms that share directors with the sued firm also exhibit valuation declines at the lawsuit filing. Fraud-affiliated directors are more likely to lose directorships at firms with stronger corporate governance and their departure is associated with valuation increases for these firms.","['Eliezer M.

Do industries lead stock markets?,"We investigate whether the returns of industry portfolios predict stock market movements. In the US, a significant number of industry returns, including retail, services, commercial real estate, metal, and petroleum, forecast the stock market by up to two months. Moreover, the propensity of an industry to predict the market is correlated with its propensity to forecast various indicators of economic activity. The eight largest non-US stock markets show remarkably similar patterns. These findings suggest that stock markets react with a delay to information contained in industry returns about their fundamentals and that information diffuses only gradually across markets.","['Harrison Hong', 'Walter Torous', 'Rossen Valkanov']","['Asset pricing', 'Information and market efficiency', 'Financial markets and macroeconomy', 'International financial markets']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06001383,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,2,Harrison Hong,2007,168.87726821743385
Technological innovation and real investment booms and busts,"We investigate why new, high-risk technologies can attract excessive and often unprofitable investment. We develop an equilibrium model in which rational, risk-averse agents overinvest in a risky technology, possibly to the point that its expected return is negative. Overinvestment results from relative wealth concerns which arise endogenously from the imperfect tradability of future endowments. Competition over future consumption leads to an indirect utility for wealth with “keeping up with the Joneses” properties that can induce herding. Because overinvestment increases with the risk of the technology, our model can explain why new, risky technological innovations may promote investment bubbles.","['Peter DeMarzo', 'Ron Kaniel', 'Ilan Kremer']","['Overinvestment', 'Technological innovation', 'Relative wealth', 'Bubble']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0700061X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,3,Peter DeMarzo,2007,168.87726821743385

To connect these findings we offer a herding model that accommodates a divergence between the information and incentives of venture capitalists and their investors.

For US Industrial firms, based on over 390,000 firm-months of data spanning 1980 to 2004, the term structure of conditional future default probabilities depends on a firm's distance to default (a volatility-adjusted measure of leverage), on the firm's trailing stock return, on trailing S&P 500 returns, and on US interest rates.

Firm-specific risk and equity market development,"We show that the increase in firm-specific risk in the US stock market is the result of new listings by riskier companies. In addition, our results explain why prior researchers have found that growth opportunities, profit margin, firm size, and industry composition (among other factors) are related to increases in firm-specific risk. The new listing effect is not driven by small companies becoming riskier but instead by a riskier sub-sample of the economy becoming publicly traded.

"Board structure, mergers, and shareholder wealth: A study of the mutual fund industry","We study mutual fund mergers between 1999 and 2001 to understand the role and effectiveness of fund boards. Some fund mergers—typically across-family mergers—benefit target shareholders but are costly to target fund directors. Such mergers are more likely when funds underperform and their boards have a larger percentage of independent trustees, suggesting that more-independent boards tolerate less underperformance before initiating across-family mergers. This effect is most pronounced when all of the fund's directors are independent, not the 75% level of independence required by the SEC. Higher-paid target fund boards are less likely to approve across-family mergers that cause substantial reductions in their compensation.","['Ajay Khorana', 'Peter Tufano', 'Lei Wedge']","['Mutual funds', 'Mergers', 'Governance']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06002224,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,2,Ajay Khorana,2007,168.87726821743385
Saving and investing for early retirement: A theoretical analysis,"We study optimal consumption and portfolio choice in a framework where investors adjust their labor supply through an irreversible choice of their retirement time. We show that investing for early retirement tends to increase savings and reduce an agent's effective relative risk aversion, thus increasing her stock market exposure. Contrary to common intuition, an investor might find it optimal to increase the proportion of financial wealth held in stocks as she ages and accumulates assets, even when her income and the investment opportunity set are constant. The model predicts a decrease in risk aversion following strong market gains like those observed in the nineties.","['Emmanuel Farhi', 'Stavros Panageas']","['Continuous time', 'Optimal stopping', 'Retirement', 'Portfolio choice', 'Savings', 'Marginal propensity to consume', 'Indivisible labor']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06001127,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,83,1,Emmanuel Farhi,2007,168.87726821743385
Mimicking repurchases,"We study the tendency of firms to mimic the repurchase announcements of their industry counterparts. We argue that a firm, by repurchasing its shares, sends a positive signal about itself and a negative one about its competitors. This induces the competing firms to mimic the behavior of the repurchasing firm by repurchasing themselves. Using a broad sample of US firms from the period 1984–2002, we show that, in concentrated industries, a repurchase announcement lowers the stock price of the other firms in the same industry. The other firms react by repurchasing themselves to undo these negative effects. Repurchases are chosen as a strategic reaction to other firms’ repurchase decisions and are not motivated by the desire to time the market, i.e., to take advantage of a significantly undervalued stock price. Therefore, repurchasing firms in more concentrated industries experience a lower increase in value in comparison with their counterparts in less concentrated industries in the post-announcement era. Alternative methodologies used to estimate long-term performance confirm that it is only the repurchasing firms in low concentration industries that outperform the market, their non-repurchasing peers, and their counterparts in more concentrated industries by amounts that are economically and statistically significant.","['Massimo Massa', 'Zahid Rehman', 'Theo Vermaelen']","['Payout policy', 'Repurchases', 'Product market competition', 'Signaling']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07000165,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,84,3,Massimo Massa,2007,168.87726821743385
So what do I get? The bank's view of lending relationships,"While many empirical studies document borrower benefits of lending relationships, less is known about lender benefits. A relationship lender's informational advantage over a non-relationship lender may generate a higher probability of selling information-sensitive products to its borrowers. Our results show that the probability of a relationship lender providing a future loan is 42%, while for a non-relationship lender, this probability is 3%. Consistent with theory, we find that borrowers with greater information asymmetries are significantly likely to obtain future loans from their relationship lenders. Relationship lenders are likely to be chosen to provide debt/equity underwriting services, but this effect is economically small.","['Sreedhar Bharath', 'Sandeep Dahiya', 'Anthony Saunders', 'Anand Srinivasan']","['Lending relationships', 'Bank loans', 'Information asymmetry', 'Debt/equity underwriting']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06000262,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,85,2,Sreedhar Bharath,2007,168.87726821743385
Investment under uncertainty and time-inconsistent preferences,"While standard real options models assume that agents possess a constant rate of time preference, there is substantial evidence that agents are impatient about choices in the short term but are patient when choosing between long-term alternatives. We extend the real options framework to model the investment-timing decisions of entrepreneurs with time-inconsistent preferences. The impact on investment-timing depends on such factors as whether entrepreneurs are sophisticated or naive in their expectations regarding their future time-inconsistent behavior, and whether the payoff from investment occurs all at once or over time.

Monitoring: Which institutions matter?,"Within a cost–benefit framework, we hypothesize that independent institutions with long-term investments will specialize in monitoring and influencing efforts rather than trading. Other institutions will not monitor. Using acquisition decisions to reveal monitoring, we show that only concentrated holdings by independent long-term institutions are related to post-merger performance. Further, the presence of these institutions makes withdrawal of bad bids more likely. These institutions make long-term portfolio adjustments rather than trading for short-term gain and only sell in advance of very bad outcomes. Examining total institutional holdings or even concentrated holdings by other types of institutions masks important variation in the subset of monitoring institutions.","['Xia Chen', 'Jarrad Harford', 'Kai Li']","['Corporate governance', 'Institutional investors', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Monitoring', 'Trading']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X07001171,Journal of Financial Economics,0.14929390953009972,86,2,Xia Chen,2007,168.87726821743385

Are perks purely managerial excess?,"A widespread view is that executive perks exemplify agency problems—they are a route through which managers misappropriate a firm's surplus. Accordingly, firms with high free cash flow, operating in industries with limited investment prospects, should offer more perks, and firms subject to more external monitoring should offer fewer perks. The evidence for agency as an explanation of perks is, at best, mixed. Perks are, however, offered in situations in which they enhance managerial productivity. While we cannot rule out the occasional aberration, and while we have little to say on the overall level of perks, our findings suggest that treating perks purely as managerial excess is incorrect.","['Raghuram G.

Dividend policy and the earned/contributed capital mix: a test of the life-cycle theory,"Consistent with a life-cycle theory of dividends, the fraction of publicly traded industrial firms that pay dividends is high when retained earnings are a large portion of total equity (and of total assets) and falls to near zero when most equity is contributed rather than earned. We observe a highly significant relation between the decision to pay dividends and the earned/contributed capital mix, controlling for profitability, growth, firm size, total equity, cash balances, and dividend history, a relation that also holds for dividend initiations and omissions. In our regressions, the mix of earned/contributed capital has a quantitatively greater impact than measures of profitability and growth opportunities. We document a massive increase in firms with negative retained earnings (from 11.8% of industrials in 1978 to 50.2% in 2002). Controlling for the earned/contributed capital mix, firms with negative retained earnings show virtually no change in their propensity to pay dividends from the mid-1970s to 2002, while those whose earned equity makes them reasonable candidates to pay dividends have a propensity reduction that is twice the overall reduction in Fama and French [2000, Journal of Financial Economics 76, 549–582]. Finally, our simulations show that, if well-established firms had not paid dividends, their cash balances would be enormous and their long-term debt trivial, thus granting extreme discretion to managers of these mature firms.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'René M.

The irrelevance of the MM dividend irrelevance theorem,"Contrary to Miller and Modigliani [1961. Dividend policy, growth, and the valuation of shares. Journal of Business 34, 411–433], payout policy is not irrelevant and investment policy is not the sole determinant of value, even in frictionless markets. MM ask “Do companies with generous distribution policies consistently sell at a premium above those with niggardly payouts?” But MM's analysis does not address this question because the joint effect of their assumptions is to mandate 100% free cash flow payout in every period, thereby rendering “niggardly payouts” infeasible and forcing distributions to a global optimum. Irrelevance obtains, but in an economically vacuous sense because the firm's opportunity set is artificially constrained to payout policies that fully distribute free cash flow. When MM's assumptions are relaxed to allow retention, payout policy matters in exactly the same sense that investment policy does. Moreover (i) the standard Fisherian model is empirically refutable, predicting that firms will make large payouts in present value terms, (ii) only when payout policy is optimized will the present value of distributions equal the PV of project cash flows, (iii) the NPV rule for investments is not sufficient to ensure value maximization, rather an analogous rule for payout policy is also necessary, and (iv) Black's [1976. The dividend puzzle. Journal of Portfolio Management 2, 5–8] “dividend puzzle” is a non-puzzle because it is rooted in the mistaken idea that MM's irrelevance theorem applies to payout/retention decisions, which it does not.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo']","['Dividends', 'Payout policy', 'Dividend puzzle']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001522,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,79,2,Harry DeAngelo,2006,168.79312408777892
Efficient tests of stock return predictability,"Conventional tests of the predictability of stock returns could be invalid, that is reject the null too frequently, when the predictor variable is persistent and its innovations are highly correlated with returns. We develop a pretest to determine whether the conventional t-test leads to invalid inference and an efficient test of predictability that corrects this problem. Although the conventional t-test is invalid for the dividend–price and smoothed earnings–price ratios, our test finds evidence for predictability. We also find evidence for predictability with the short rate and the long-short yield spread, for which the conventional t-test leads to valid inference.","['John Y.

On the marketing of IPOs,"Derrien [2005. Journal of Finance 60, 487–521] and Ljungqvist et al. [2006. Journal of Business] build upon the work of Miller [1977. Journal of Finance 32, 1151–1168] and claim that issuers and the regular customers of investment bankers benefit from the presence of sentiment investors (noise traders) in the market for an initial public offering (IPO). Thus we argue that investment bankers have an incentive to promote an IPO to induce sentiment investors into the market for it. Consistent with this motivation and these models, we expect that the promotional efforts of investment bankers should influence the compensation of investment bankers, the valuation of an IPO, its initial returns and trading, the wealth gains of insider shareholders, and the likelihood that an issuer switches investment bankers for a subsequent seasoned equity offering. Examining data for a sample of IPOs from 1993 through 2000, we find evidence consistent with these predictions and so with the proposition that an investment banker's ability to market an IPO to sentiment investors is important.","['Douglas O.

External finance constraints and the intertemporal pattern of intermittent investment,Do external finance constraints affect the timing of large investment projects? Simulations of a model with fixed capital-stock adjustment costs establish the hypothesis that external finance constraints lower a firm's investment hazard: the probability of undertaking a large project today as a function of the time since the last project. Hazard model estimation that controls for productivity and adjustment costs supports this hypothesis. Small firms that distribute cash to shareholders have higher hazards than small firms that do not; very small firms have lower hazards than small firms; small stand-alone firms have significantly lower hazards than small segments of conglomerates.,['Toni M.

The value of tax shields IS equal to the present value of tax shields,"Fernandez [2004b. The value of tax shields is not equal to the present value of tax shields. Journal of Financial Economics 73, 145–165] argues that the present value effect of the tax saving on debt cannot be calculated as simply the present value of the tax shields associated with interest. This contradicts standard results in the literature. It implies that, even though the capital market is complete, value-additivity is violated. As a consequence, adjusted present value formulae of a standard sort cannot be used. Also, Fernandez's argument implies that the value of the tax saving differs from conventional estimates by a considerable amount. We reconcile Fernandez's results with standard valuation formulae for the tax saving from debt. We show that, as one would expect, the value of the debt tax saving is the present value of the tax savings from interest. The apparent violation of value-additivity in the Fernandez paper comes from mixing the Miles and Ezzell and Miller and Modigliani leverage policies.","['Ian A. Cooper', 'Kjell G.

Strength of analyst coverage following IPOs,"Firms with poor aftermarket performance are given higher target prices and are more likely to receive strong buy recommendations, especially by analysts affiliated with the lead underwriter. This favorable coverage is relatively short lived, typically lasting less than six months. Controlling for the quantity of coverage received, stock prices of newly public firms increase more when the target price ratio is high and recommendation is a strong buy. These results suggest that when a firm goes public, underwriter-affiliated analysts provide protection in the form of “booster shots” of stronger coverage if the firm experiences poor aftermarket stock performance.","['Christopher James', 'Jason Karceski']","['IPO', 'Underpricing', 'Target price', 'Stock recommendation', 'Security analysts']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0600047X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,82,1,Christopher James,2006,168.79312408777892

Cross-sectional forecasts of the equity premium,"If investors are myopic mean-variance optimizers, a stock's expected return is linearly related to its beta in the cross-section. The slope of the relation is the cross-sectional price of risk, which should equal the expected equity premium. We use this simple observation to forecast the equity-premium time series with the cross-sectional price of risk. We also introduce novel statistical methods for testing stock-return predictability based on endogenous variables whose shocks are potentially correlated with return shocks. Our empirical tests show that the cross-sectional price of risk (1) is strongly correlated with the market's yield measures and (2) predicts equity-premium realizations, especially in the first half of our 1927–2002 sample.","['Christopher Polk', 'Samuel Thompson', 'Tuomo Vuolteenaho']","['Equity premium', 'CAPM', 'Predicting returns', 'Conditional inference', 'Neural networks']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05002126,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,81,1,Christopher Polk,2006,168.79312408777892

"Trades outside the quotes: Reporting delay, trading option, or trade size?","In the period 1993 through 2002 examined in this study, quoted and effective spreads declined substantially on Nasdaq and to a lesser degree on the NYSE. At the same time, however, trades outside the quotes increased dramatically on Nasdaq. Because investors would prefer to trade at the quotes rather than outside the quotes, we examine why trades outside the quotes are observed. We focus on how the continuous market mechanism itself influences the outcome of orders and the reporting of trades, and we conclude that slippage exists in the market mechanism. Outside-trades occur on Nasdaq, first, because of delays in reporting trades, second, because the ability of dealers to delay execution of trades creates a look-back option, which when exercised results in outside-trades, and third, because large trades can take place at prices outside the quotes. Outside-trades are rarely observed on the NYSE because the market is more centralized. While the pattern of trading on the NYSE is not inconsistent with the presence of a look-back option, our tests provide no direct evidence that specialists are exercising such an option.","['Hans R.

This technique allows us to incorporate realistic marginal distributions that capture essential empirical features of these risks such as skewness and fat-tails while allowing for a rich dependence structure. We explore the impact of business mix and inter-risk correlations on total risk. We then compare the copula-based method with several conventional approaches to computing risk.","['Joshua V.

I quantify these “volatility costs” of debt and examine their impact on financing decisions. I find that: (1) the volatility costs of debt can be large for executives exposed to firm-specific risk; (2) for a range of empirically relevant parameters, higher option ownership tends to increase, not decrease, the volatility costs of debt; and (3) for managers with stock options, a stock price increase typically raises volatility costs. For a large sample of US firms, I find evidence that volatility costs affect both the level of and short-term changes in debt, and that volatility costs help explain a firm's choice between debt and equity.",['Katharina Lewellen'],"['Executive compensation', 'Stock options', 'Risk-taking incentives', 'Capital structure', 'Leverage']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0600136X,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,82,3,Katharina Lewellen,2006,168.79312408777892

Opaque stocks with high R2s are also more likely to crash, that is, to deliver large negative returns. Using stock returns from 40 stock markets from 1990 to 2001, we find strong positive relations between R2 and several measures of opaqueness.

"Investor attention, overconfidence and category learning","Motivated by psychological evidence that attention is a scarce cognitive resource, we model investors’ attention allocation in learning and study the effects of this on asset-price dynamics. We show that limited investor attention leads to category-learning behavior, i.e., investors tend to process more market and sector-wide information than firm-specific information. This endogenous structure of information, when combined with investor overconfidence, generates important features observed in return comovement that are otherwise difficult to explain with standard rational expectations models.

Was there a Nasdaq bubble in the late 1990s?,"Not necessarily: a firm's fundamental value increases with uncertainty about average future profitability, and this uncertainty was unusually high in the late 1990s. After calibrating a stock valuation model that takes this uncertainty into account, we compute the level of uncertainty that is needed to match the observed Nasdaq valuations at their peak. The uncertainty we obtain seems plausible because it matches not only the high level but also the high volatility of Nasdaq stock prices. In general, we argue that the level and volatility of stock prices are positively linked through firm-specific uncertainty about average future profitability.","['Ľuboš Pástor', 'Pietro Veronesi']","['Bubble', 'Nasdaq', 'Valuation', 'Uncertainty', 'Volatility']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05002163,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,81,1,Ľuboš Pástor,2006,168.79312408777892

I then empirically examine the within-industry relation between leverage and sales performance using data from 115 industries over 30 years.

Asymmetric benchmarking in compensation: Executives are rewarded for good luck but not penalized for bad,"Principal-agent theory suggests that a manager should be paid relative to a benchmark that removes the effect of market or sector performance on the firm's own performance. Recently, it has been argued that such indexation is not observed in the data because executives can set pay in their own interests; that is, they can enjoy “pay for luck” as well as “pay for performance.” We first show that this argument is incomplete. The positive expected return on stock markets reflects compensation for bearing systematic risk. If executives’ pay is tied to market movements, they can only expect to receive the market-determined return for risk-bearing. This argument, however, assumes that executive pay is tied to bad luck as well as to good luck. If executives can truly influence the setting of their pay, they will seek to have their performance benchmarked only when it is in their interest, namely, when the benchmark has fallen. Using industry benchmarks, we find significantly less pay for luck when luck is down (in which case, pay for luck would reduce compensation) than when it is up. These empirical results are robust to a variety of alternative hypotheses and robustness checks, and they suggest that the average executive loses 25–45% less pay from bad luck than is gained from good luck.","['Gerald T.

Should corporate debt include a rating trigger?,"Recent corporate debt offerings have included a covenant specifying a pre-determined payment to debtholders when the debt is downgraded. We examine the incentive for equityholders to increase firm risk (and the associated costs) when debt includes a “rating trigger.” Equityholders of firms with a low-risk profile and operating flexibility choose debt with a trigger, while equityholders of firms with a high-risk profile and less flexibility choose regular debt. A trigger that requires an equity infusion better mitigates conflicts between equityholders and debtholders than a trigger paid by liquidating assets. A trigger that increases the coupon rate is not optimal.","['Karan Bhanot', 'Antonio S.

The conditional CAPM does not explain asset-pricing anomalies,"Recent studies suggest that the conditional CAPM holds, period by period, and that time-variation in risk and expected returns can explain why the unconditional CAPM fails. In contrast, we argue that variation in betas and the equity premium would have to be implausibly large to explain important asset-pricing anomalies like momentum and the value premium. We also provide a simple new test of the conditional CAPM using direct estimates of conditional alphas and betas from short-window regressions, avoiding the need to specify conditioning information.

Partial adjustment toward target capital structures,"The empirical literature provides conflicting assessments about how firms choose their capital structures. Distinguishing among the three main hypotheses (“tradeoff”, pecking order, and market timing) requires that we know whether firms have long-run leverage targets and (if so) how quickly they adjust toward them. Yet many previous researchers have applied empirical specifications that fail to recognize the potential for incomplete adjustment. A more general, partial-adjustment model of firm leverage indicates that firms do have target capital structures.

Less profitable firms innovate more, though in the years subsequent to the introduction of the innovation, the profitability of the innovators increases significantly.

Estimation of continuous-time models with an application to equity volatility dynamics,"The treatment of this article renders closed-form density approximation feasible for univariate continuous-time models.

Density-based inferences can now be drawn for a broader set of models of equity volatility.

Corporate tax avoidance and high-powered incentives,"This paper analyzes the links between corporate tax avoidance and the growth of high-powered incentives for managers. A simple model demonstrates the role of feedback effects between tax sheltering and managerial diversion in determining how high-powered incentives influence tax sheltering decisions. A novel measure of corporate tax avoidance (the component of the book-tax gap not attributable to accounting accruals) allows for an investigation of the link between tax avoidance and incentive compensation. Increases in incentive compensation tend to reduce the level of tax sheltering, in a manner consistent with a complementary relationship between diversion and sheltering. In addition, this negative effect is driven primarily by firms with relatively weak governance arrangements, confirming a central prediction of the model. These results can help explain the growing cross-sectional variation among firms in their levels of tax avoidance, the undersheltering puzzle, and why large book-tax gaps are associated with subsequent negative abnormal returns.","['Mihir A.

"Capital structure, credit risk, and macroeconomic conditions","This paper develops a framework for analyzing the impact of macroeconomic conditions on credit risk and dynamic capital structure choice. We begin by observing that when cash flows depend on current economic conditions, there will be a benefit for firms to adapt their default and financing policies to the position of the economy in the business cycle phase. We then demonstrate that this simple observation has a wide range of empirical implications for corporations. Notably, we show that our model can replicate observed debt levels and the countercyclicality of leverage ratios. We also demonstrate that it can reproduce the observed term structure of credit spreads and generate strictly positive credit spreads for debt contracts with very short maturities. Finally, we characterize the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the pace and size of capital structure changes, and debt capacity.","['Dirk Hackbarth', 'Jianjun Miao', 'Erwan Morellec']","['Dynamic capital structure', 'Credit spreads', 'Macroeconomic conditions']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06001115,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,82,3,Dirk Hackbarth,2006,168.79312408777892
Who herds?,"This paper develops a test for herding in forecasts by professional financial analysts that is robust to (a) correlated information amongst analysts; (b) common unforecasted industry-wide earnings shocks; (c) information arrival over the forecasting cycle; (d) the possibility that the earnings that analysts forecast differ from what the econometrician observes; and (e) systematic optimism or pessimism among analysts. We find that forecasts are biased, but that analysts do not herd. Instead, analysts “anti-herd”: Analysts systematically issue biased contrarian forecasts that overshoot the publicly-available consensus forecast in the direction of their private information.","['Dan Bernhardt', 'Murillo Campello', 'Edward Kutsoati']","['Earnings forecasting', 'Financial analysts', 'Herding', 'Econometric test', 'Contrarian behavior']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06000213,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,80,3,Dan Bernhardt,2006,168.79312408777892
An equilibrium model of incentive contracts in the presence of information manipulation,"This paper develops an agency model in which stock-based compensation is a double-edged sword, inducing managers to exert productive effort but also to divert valuable firm resources to misrepresent performance. We examine how the potential for manipulation affects the equilibrium level of pay-for-performance sensitivity and derive several new cross-sectional implications that are consistent with recent empirical studies. In addition, we analyze the impact of recent regulatory changes contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and show how policies intended to increase firm value by reducing misrepresentation can actually reduce firm value or increase the upward bias in manipulated disclosures.","['Eitan Goldman', 'Steve L.

The impact of performance-based compensation on misreporting,"This paper examines the effect of CEO compensation contracts on misreporting. We find that the sensitivity of the CEO's option portfolio to stock price is significantly positively related to the propensity to misreport. We do not find that the sensitivity of other components of CEO compensation, i.e., equity, restricted stock, long-term incentive payouts, and salary plus bonus have any significant impact on the propensity to misreport. Relative to other components of compensation, stock options are associated with stronger incentives to misreport because convexity in CEO wealth introduced by stock options limits the downside risk on detection of the misreporting.","['Natasha Burns', 'Simi Kedia']","['Restatements', 'Misreporting', 'Compensation', 'Options']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001133,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,79,1,Natasha Burns,2006,168.79312408777892
Do a firm's equity returns reflect the risk of its pension plan?,"This paper examines the empirical question of whether systematic equity risk of US firms as measured by beta from the capital asset pricing model reflects the risk of their pension plans. There are a number of reasons to suspect that it might not. Chief among them is the opaque set of accounting rules used to report pension assets, liabilities, and expenses. Pension plan assets and liabilities are off-balance sheet and are often viewed as segregated from the rest of the firm, with its own trustees. Pension accounting rules are complicated. Furthermore, the role of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation clouds the real relation between pension plan risk and firm equity risk. The empirical findings in this paper are consistent with the hypothesis that equity risk does reflect the risk of the firm's pension plan despite arcane accounting rules for pensions. This finding is consistent with informational efficiency of the capital markets. It also has implications for corporate finance practice in the determination of the cost of capital for capital budgeting. Standard procedure uses de-leveraged equity return betas to infer the cost of capital for operating assets. But the de-leveraged betas are not adjusted for the risk of the pension assets and liabilities. Failure to make this adjustment typically biases upward estimates of the discount rate for capital budgeting. The magnitude of the bias is shown here to be large for a number of well-known US companies. This bias can result in positive net present value projects being rejected.","['Li Jin', 'Robert C.

Stock price synchronicity and analyst coverage in emerging markets,"This paper examines the relation between the stock price synchronicity and analyst activity in emerging markets. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that security analysts specialize in the production of firm-specific information, we find that securities which are covered by more analysts incorporate greater (lesser) market-wide (firm-specific) information. Using the R2 statistics of the market model as a measure of synchronicity of stock price movement, we find that greater analyst coverage increases stock price synchronicity. Furthermore, after controlling for the influence of firm size on the lead–lag relation, we find that the returns of high analyst-following portfolio lead returns of low analyst-following portfolio more than vice versa. We also find that the aggregate change in the earnings forecasts in a high analyst-following portfolio affects the aggregate returns of the portfolio itself as well as those of the low analyst-following portfolio, whereas the aggregate change in the earnings forecasts of the low analyst-following portfolio have no predictive ability. Finally, when the forecast dispersion is high, the effect of analyst coverage on stock price synchronicity is reduced.","['Kalok Chan', 'Allaudeen Hameed']","['Analyst coverage', 'International financial markets', 'Price synchronicity', 'Information efficiency']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001741,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,80,1,Kalok Chan,2006,168.79312408777892
Shareholder wealth effects and bid negotiation in freeze-out deals: Are minority shareholders left out in the cold?,"This paper examines the shareholder wealth effects of bids by controlling shareholders seeking to acquire the remaining minority equity stake in a firm, deals commonly referred to as minority freeze-outs. Minority claimants in freeze-out offers receive an allocation of deal surplus at the bid announcement that exceeds their pro rata claim on the firm. An analysis of bid outcomes and renegotiation indicates that minority claimants and their agents exercise significant bargaining power during freeze-out proposals. Overall, our results suggest that legal standards and economic incentives are sufficient to deter self-dealing by controllers during freeze-out bids.","['Thomas W. Bates', 'Michael L.

Earnings and price momentum,"This paper examines whether earnings momentum and price momentum are related. Both in time-series as well as in cross-sectional asset pricing tests, we find that price momentum is captured by the systematic component of earnings momentum. The predictive power of past returns is subsumed by a zero-investment portfolio that is long on stocks with high earnings surprises and short on stocks with low earnings surprises. Further, returns to the earnings-based zero-investment portfolio are significantly related to future macroeconomic activities, including growth in GDP, industrial production, consumption, labor income, inflation, and T-bill returns.","['Tarun Chordia', 'Lakshmanan Shivakumar']","['Post-earnings announcement drift', 'Price momentum', 'Earnings momentum', 'Market efficiency', 'Macroeconomy']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05002175,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,80,3,Tarun Chordia,2006,168.79312408777892

Momentum and post-earnings-announcement drift anomalies: The role of liquidity risk,"This paper investigates the components of liquidity risk that are important for understanding asset-pricing anomalies. Firm-level liquidity is decomposed into variable and fixed price effects and estimated using intraday data for the period 1983–2001. Unexpected systematic (market-wide) variations of the variable component rather than the fixed component of liquidity are shown to be priced within the context of momentum and post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD) portfolio returns. As the variable component is typically associated with private information [e.g., Kyle, 1985. Econometrica 53, 1315–1335], the results suggest that a substantial part of momentum and PEAD returns can be viewed as compensation for the unexpected variations in the aggregate ratio of informed traders to noise traders.",['Ronnie Sadka'],"['Liquidity risk', 'Transaction costs', 'Price impact', 'Asset pricing', 'Momentum trading', 'Post-earnings-announcement drift']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001819,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,80,2,Ronnie Sadka,2006,168.79312408777892
"The American keiretsu and universal banks: Investing, voting and sitting on nonfinancials’ corporate boards","This paper investigates the equity investments and voting rights that American banks control through their trust business. The paper also studies whether the voting rights American banks control through their trust business help explain their presence on firms’ corporate boards. We find that on average the largest 100 American banks control 10% of the voting rights of S&P 500 firms. We also find that there are several firms in the S&P 500 index in which the top banks control more than 20% of their voting rights, and several firms in the country in which these banks control more than 60% of their voting rights. Our investigation into the presence of American bankers on corporate boards shows that bankers are more likely to join the boards of firms in which they control a large voting stake. We also find that banks’ lending relationships help explain bankers’ board memberships. Our results further show that bankers who have both a voting stake in a firm and a lending relationship with it have a higher likelihood of joining the firm's board of directors.","['João A.C.

Evidence on the effects of bank competition on firm borrowing and investment,"This paper presents evidence on the financial and real effects of bank competition using a large panel of privately held firms. I trace the firm-level impact of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which increased the competitiveness of U.S. banking markets. Following the deregulation, newly formed firms used significantly less external debt, were smaller, and realized higher returns on assets, consistent with their investing less due to greater financial constraints. These effects diminish as firms age, ultimately reversing sign.

"IPOs, acquisitions, and the use of convertible securities in venture capital","This paper provides a new explanation for the use of convertible securities in venture capital. A key property of convertible preferred equity is that it allocates different cash flow rights, depending on whether exit occurs by acquisition or IPO. The paper builds a model with double moral hazard, where both the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist provide value-adding effort. The optimal contract gives the venture capitalist more cash flow rights in acquisitions than IPOs. This explains the use of convertible preferred equity, including automatic conversion at IPO. Contingent control rights are also important for achieving efficient exit decisions.",['Thomas Hellmann'],"['Venture capital', 'Convertible securities', 'IPO', 'Acquisition']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06000183,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,81,3,Thomas Hellmann,2006,168.79312408777892
Liquidity needs and vulnerability to financial underdevelopment,"This paper provides evidence that financial development has a large causal effect in the reduction of macroeconomic volatility resulting from the role of the financial system in liquidity provision. In particular, financial system development leads to a comparatively larger reduction in the volatility of output in sectors with high liquidity needs. Most of this decline results from the stabilization of the output of existing firms, although the volatility of the number of firms also drops significantly.

We view political connections as an example for domestic arrangements which can reduce the benefits of global financing. Using data from Indonesia, we find that firms with strong political connections are less likely to have publicly traded foreign securities. As a result, estimates of the performance consequences of foreign financing are severely biased if value-creating domestic arrangements such as political relationships are ignored. Connections not only alter firms’ financing strategies, they also influence long-run performance. Tracking returns across several regimes, we show that firms have difficulty re-establishing connections with a new government when their patron falls from power, leading closely connected firms to underperform under the new regime and subsequently to increase their foreign financing.","['Christian Leuz', 'Felix Oberholzer-Gee']","['Cross listing', 'Financing choices', 'Emerging markets', 'Asian financial crisis', 'Indonesia', 'Disclosure']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06000043,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,81,2,Christian Leuz,2006,168.79312408777892

Competition and cooperation among exchanges: A theory of cross-listing and endogenous listing standards,"We analyze firms’ choice of exchange to list equity and exchanges’ choice of listing standards when insiders have private information about firm value, but outsiders can produce (noisy) information at a cost. Exchanges are populated by two kinds of investors, whose numbers vary across exchanges: sophisticated (low information production cost) investors and ordinary (high–cost) investors. While firms are short-lived, exchanges are long-lived, value-maximizing agents whose listing and disclosure standards evolve over time. The listing standards chosen by exchanges affect their “reputation,” since outsiders can partially infer the rigor of these standards from the post-listing performance of firms. We show that, while exchanges use their listing standards as a tool in competing for listings with other exchanges, this will not necessarily lead to a “race to the bottom” in listing standards. Further, a merger between two exchanges may result in a higher listing standard for the combined exchange relative to that of either of the merging exchanges.

Competition among regulators and credit market integration,"We analyze the incentives for independent bank regulators with financially integrated jurisdictions to form a regulatory union. Externalities lead competing regulators to choose suboptimally low standards. Centralized regulation, however, entails a loss of flexibility if equal standards must be applied across jurisdictions. We find that, first, centralized regulation will more likely emerge among relatively homogeneous jurisdictions/countries. Second, centralized regulation will be unanimously preferred to independence only if it entails standards higher than those of the country with the highest individual standards. Third, financial integration among more than two jurisdictions may prevent partial unions, which, in turn, may prevent more comprehensive agreements.","['Giovanni Dell’Ariccia', 'Robert Marquez']","['Bank regulation', 'Market integration', 'Regulatory competition']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001376,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,79,2,Giovanni Dell’Ariccia,2006,168.79312408777892
Should business groups be dismantled? The equilibrium costs of efficient internal capital markets,"We analyze the relationship between conglomerates’ internal capital markets and the efficiency of economy-wide capital allocation, and we identify a novel cost of conglomeration that arises from an equilibrium framework. Because of financial market imperfections engendered by imperfect investor protection, conglomerates that engage in winner-picking (Stein, 1997 [Internal capital markets and the competition for corporate resources. Journal of Finance 52, 111–133]) find it optimal to allocate scarce capital internally to mediocre projects, even when other firms in the economy have higher-productivity projects that are in need of additional capital. This bias for internal capital allocation can decrease allocative efficiency even when conglomerates have efficient internal capital markets, because a substantial presence of conglomerates might make it harder for other firms in the economy to raise capital. We also argue that the negative externality associated with conglomeration is particularly costly for countries that are at intermediary levels of financial development. In such countries, a high degree of conglomeration, generated, for example, by the control of the corporate sector by family business groups, could decrease the efficiency of the capital market. Our theory generates novel empirical predictions that cannot be derived in models that ignore the equilibrium effects of conglomerates. These predictions are consistent with anecdotal evidence that the presence of business groups in developing countries inhibits the growth of new independent firms because of a lack of finance.","['Heitor Almeida', 'Daniel Wolfenzon']","['Capital allocation', 'Conglomerates', 'Investor protection', 'Internal capital markets']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001352,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,79,1,Heitor Almeida,2006,168.79312408777892
A theory of socialistic internal capital markets,"We develop a model of a two-division firm in which the “strong” division has, on average, higher quality investment opportunities than the “weak” division. We show that, in the presence of agency and information problems, optimal effort incentives are less powerful and thus managerial effort is lower in the strong division. This leads the firm to bias its project selection policy against the strong division. The selection bias is more severe when there is a larger spread in the average quality of investment opportunities between the two divisions.","['Antonio E. Bernardo', 'Jiang Luo', 'James J.D.

Dynamic forecasting behavior by analysts: Theory and evidence,"We develop a multi-period learning model to examine the relation between analysts’ forecasting behavior and their performance. In a competitive market for banking services, the surplus and the analyst's payoff, which is determined through bargaining, are convex in her reputation. The convexity of her payoff structure and the presence of employment risk lead to a U-shaped relation between the analyst's forecast boldness and prior performance and a positive relation between forecast boldness and experience. We find support for these predictions in our empirical analysis. Significant underperformers (outperformers) face higher (lower) employment risk and are more likely to issue bolder forecasts.","['Jonathan Clarke', 'Ajay Subramanian']","['Analysts', 'Career concerns', 'Employment risk', 'Dynamic forecasting', 'Herding']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001728,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,80,1,Jonathan Clarke,2006,168.79312408777892
"Market transparency, liquidity externalities, and institutional trading costs in corporate bonds","We develop a simple model of the effect of public transaction reporting on trade execution costs and test it using a sample of institutional trades in corporate bonds, before and after initiation of the TRACE reporting system. Trade execution costs fell approximately 50% for bonds eligible for TRACE transaction reporting, and 20% for bonds not eligible for TRACE reporting, suggesting the presence of a “liquidity externality.” The key results are robust to changes in variables, such as interest rate volatility and trading activity that might also affect execution costs. Market shares and the cost advantage to large dealers decreased post-TRACE.

The strategy of professional forecasting,"We develop and compare two theories of professional forecasters’ strategic behavior. The first theory, reputational cheap talk, posits that forecasters endeavor to convince the market that they are well informed. The market evaluates their forecasting talent on the basis of the forecasts and the realized state. If the market expects forecasters to report their posterior expectations honestly, then forecasts are shaded toward the prior mean. With correct market expectations, equilibrium forecasts are imprecise but not shaded. The second theory posits that forecasters compete in a forecasting contest with pre-specified rules. In a winner-take-all contest, equilibrium forecasts are excessively differentiated.","['Marco Ottaviani', 'Peter Norman Sørensen']","['Forecasting', 'Reputation', 'Cheap talk', 'Contest', 'Exaggeration']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X06000286,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,81,2,Marco Ottaviani,2006,168.79312408777892
"Hedging, speculation, and shareholder value","We document that gold mining firms have consistently realized economically significant cash flow gains from their derivatives transactions. We conclude that these cash flows have increased shareholder value since there is no evidence of an offsetting adjustment in firms’ systematic risk. This finding contradicts a central assumption in the risk management literature that derivatives transactions have zero net present value, and highlights an important motive for firms to use derivatives that the literature has hitherto ignored. Although we find considerable evidence of selective hedging in our sample, the cash flow gains from selective hedging appear to be small at best.","['Tim R. Adam', 'Chitru S.

We address three questions: What types of connected transactions lead to expropriation of minority shareholders? Which firms are more likely to expropriate? Does the market anticipate the expropriation by firms? On average, firms announcing connected transactions earn significant negative excess returns, significantly lower than firms announcing similar arm's length transactions. We find limited evidence that firms undertaking connected transactions trade at discounted valuations prior to the expropriation, suggesting that investors cannot predict expropriation and revalue firms only when expropriation does occur.","['Yan-Leung Cheung', 'P.

The economic consequences of increased disclosure: Evidence from international cross-listings,"We examine market behavior around earnings announcements to understand the consequences of the increased disclosure that non-U.S. firms face when listing shares in the U.S. We find that absolute return and volume reactions to earnings announcements typically increase significantly once a company cross-lists in the U.S. Furthermore, these increases are greatest for firms from developed countries and for firms that pursue over-the-counter listings or private placements, which do not have stringent disclosure requirements. Additional tests support the hypothesis that it is changes in the individual firm's disclosure environment, rather than changes in its market liquidity, ownership, or trading venue, that explain our findings.","['Warren Bailey', 'G.

During the 1990–2001 period, firms raised about $25.3 trillion of new capital, including $4.9 trillion from abroad. International debt issuances are substantially more common than equity issuances, with debt (equity) issues accounting for 87% (9%) of all securities issued internationally, and about 20% (12%) of all public debt issuances.

These returns are positively correlated with prior acquirer access to information about the research and development activities at target firms and a superior negotiating position. A unique Desperation Index is employed to determine the current status of a firm's internal productivity.

We then explore how firm characteristics affect knowledge flows within alliances and find positive effects due to technological, geographic, and business similarities between partners.

Dividend changes and catering incentives,"We extend Baker and Wurgler's [2004a. Journal of Finance 59 1125–1165] catering theory to include decreases and increases in existing dividends. Consistent with our extended model, we find that the decision to change the dividend and the magnitude of the change depend on the premium that the capital market places on dividends. We also find that the stock market reaction to dividend changes depends on the dividend premium. Thus, the capital market rewards managers for considering investor demand for dividends when making decisions about the level of dividends.","['Wei Li', 'Erik Lie']","['Dividends', 'Payout policy', 'Catering']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001583,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,80,2,Wei Li,2006,168.79312408777892

Our findings provide indirect empirical support for valuation models in the accounting and finance literatures (e.g., Ohlson, 1995) that emphasize the role of future earnings in predicting stock price movements.

The average annual deduction produced by the shelters in our sample is very large, equaling approximately nine percent of asset value. These deductions are more than three times as large as interest deductions for comparable companies. The firms in our sample use less debt when they engage in tax sheltering. Compared to companies with similar pre-shelter debt ratios, the debt ratios of firms engaged in tax shelters fall by about 8%.

Asset pricing with unforeseen contingencies,"We investigate an economy of heterogeneous agents that cannot specify all exogenous welfare-relevant events and consequently view the impact of unforeseen contingencies as utility shocks. In this setting we characterize an appropriate market equilibrium concept when securities can trade only on demand- and price-contingent events. We establish the existence of an equilibrium for a class of parametric models in which aggregating taste shocks across agents can lead to nonconsumption pricing factors. To fit the stylized facts, (i) non consumption factors must dominate the pricing kernel and contribute to the variation of the wealth-consumption ratio, (ii) markets must be incomplete and the set of claims that are traded endogenously determined, (iii) agents’ preferences with respect to unforeseen contingencies must be non-expected utility, and, (iv) although non-consumption pricing factors can be conditionally uncorrelated with aggregate consumption shocks, they must be correlated with shocks to expected consumption growth.","['Alan Kraus', 'Jacob S.

On the role of arbitrageurs in rational markets,"We investigate the role of “arbitrageurs,” who exploit price discrepancies between redundant securities. Arbitrage opportunities arise endogenously in an economy populated by rational, heterogeneous investors facing investment restrictions. We show that an arbitrageur alleviates these restrictions and improves the transfer of risk amongst investors. When the arbitrageur behaves noncompetitively, taking into account the price impact of his trades, he optimally limits the size of his positions due to his decreasing marginal profits. When the arbitrageur is subject to margin requirements and is endowed with capital from outside investors, the size of his trades and capital are endogenously determined in equilibrium.","['Suleyman Basak', 'Benjamin Croitoru']","['Arbitrage', 'Asset pricing', 'Margin requirements', 'Noncompetitive markets', 'Risk-sharing']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05002114,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,81,1,Suleyman Basak,2006,168.79312408777892
Feedback and the success of irrational investors,"We provide a model in which irrational investors trade based upon considerations that have no inherent connection to fundamentals. However, trading activity affects market prices, and because of feedback from security prices to cash flows, the irrational trades influence underlying cash flows. As a result, irrational investors can, in some situations, earn abnormal (i.e., risk-adjusted) profits that can exceed the abnormal profits of rational informed investors. Although the trading of irrational investors cause prices to deviate from fundamental values, stock prices follow a random walk.","['David Hirshleifer', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam', 'Sheridan Titman']","['Investor psychology', 'Market efficiency', 'Feedback', 'Irrational trading', 'Behavioral finance']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05002187,Journal of Financial Economics,0.06513562492013243,81,2,David Hirshleifer,2006,168.79312408777892
Managerial incentives and risk-taking,"We provide empirical evidence of a strong causal relation between managerial compensation and investment policy, debt policy, and firm risk. Controlling for CEO pay-performance sensitivity (delta) and the feedback effects of firm policy and risk on the managerial compensation scheme, we find that higher sensitivity of CEO wealth to stock volatility (vega) implements riskier policy choices, including relatively more investment in R&D, less investment in PPE, more focus, and higher leverage. We also find that riskier policy choices generally lead to compensation structures with higher vega and lower delta.

Tax management strategies with multiple risky assets,"We study the consumption-portfolio problem in a setting with capital gain taxes and multiple risky stocks to understand how short selling influences portfolio choice with a shorting-the-box restriction. Our analysis uncovers a novel trading flexibility strategy whereby, to minimize future tax-induced trading costs, the investor optimally shorts one of the stocks (or equivalently, buys put options) even when no stock has an embedded gain. Alternatively, an imperfect form of shorting the box can reduce aggregate equity exposure ex post. Given these two short selling strategies, it is common for an unconstrained investor to short some equity while a constrained investor holds a positive investment in all stocks. With no shorting, the benefit of trading separately in multiple stocks is not economically significant.","['Michael F.

"Stock returns, aggregate earnings surprises, and behavioral finance","We study the stock market's reaction to aggregate earnings news. Prior research shows that, for individual firms, stock prices react positively to earnings news but require several quarters to fully reflect the information in earnings. We find a substantially different pattern in aggregate data. First, returns are unrelated to past earnings, suggesting that prices neither underreact nor overreact to aggregate earnings news. Second, aggregate returns correlate negatively with concurrent earnings; over the last 30 years, for example, stock prices increased 5.7% in quarters with negative earnings growth and only 2.1% otherwise. This finding suggests that earnings and discount rates move together over time and provides new evidence that discount-rate shocks explain a significant fraction of aggregate stock returns.","['S.P.

These policies represent deliberate attempts to reduce share price undervaluation relative to NAV. Funds that adopt minimum dividend policies experience reductions in their share price discounts, trade at smaller discounts than other funds, earn greater excess returns following policy adoption, and their managers survive longer than other managers do. The results are broadly consistent with the predictions of dividend signaling models, and suggest that high quality closed-end funds can reduce undervaluation via dividend policy.","['Shane A.

Leverage and investment in diversified firms,"Within diversified firms, the negative impact of leverage on investment is significantly greater for high q than for low q segments and significantly greater for non-core than for core segments. This differs substantially from focused firms and is consistent with the view that diversified firms allocate a disproportionate share of their debt service burden to their higher q and non-core segments. We also find that, among low-growth firms, the positive relation between leverage and firm value is significantly weaker in diversified firms than in focused firms. We conclude that the disciplinary benefits of debt are partially offset by the additional managerial discretion in allocating debt service that is provided by the diversified organizational structure.","['Seoungpil Ahn', 'David J.

Does good corporate governance include employee representation? Evidence from German corporate boards,"Within the German corporate governance system, employee representation on the supervisory board is typically legally mandated.

Indeed, we find that labor representation provides a powerful means of monitoring and reduces agency costs within the firm. Moreover, we show that the greater the need for coordination within the firm, the greater the potential improvement there is in governance effectiveness through the judicious use of labor representation.

What drives merger waves?,"Aggregate merger waves could be due to market timing or to clustering of industry shocks for which mergers facilitate change to the new environment. This study finds that economic, regulatory and technological shocks drive industry merger waves. Whether the shock leads to a wave of mergers, however, depends on whether there is sufficient overall capital liquidity. This macro-level liquidity component causes industry merger waves to cluster in time even if industry shocks do not. Market-timing variables have little explanatory power relative to an economic model including this liquidity component. The contemporaneous peak in divisional acquisitions for cash also suggests an economic motivation for the merger activity.",['Jarrad Harford'],"['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Takeover', 'Merger waves', 'Behavioral', 'Capital liquidity']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04002041,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,77,3,Jarrad Harford,2005,168.708979958124
Comovement,"Building on Vijh (Rev. Financial Stud. 7 (1994)), we use additions to the S&P 500 to distinguish two views of return comovement: the traditional view, which attributes it to comovement in news about fundamental value, and an alternative view, in which frictions or sentiment delink it from fundamentals.

"Law, finance, and economic growth in China","China is an important counterexample to the findings in the law, institutions, finance, and growth literature: Neither its legal nor financial system is well developed, yet it has one of the fastest growing economies. While the law–finance–growth nexus applies to the State Sector and the Listed Sector, with arguably poorer applicable legal and financial mechanisms, the Private Sector grows much faster than the others and provides most of the economy's growth. The imbalance among the three sectors suggests that alternative financing channels and governance mechanisms, such as those based on reputation and relationships, support the growth of the Private Sector.","['Franklin Allen', 'Jun Qian', 'Meijun Qian']","['Law and finance', 'Economic growth', 'Private sector', 'Corporate governance', 'Reputation and relationships']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0500036X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,77,1,Franklin Allen,2005,168.708979958124
Do tender offers create value? New methods and evidence,"Conventional techniques of estimating takeover value improvements measure only a fraction of the total gain and include revelation about bidder stand-alone value. To address these biases, we develop the probability scaling method, which rescales announcement date returns; and the intervention method, which uses returns at intervening events. Perceived value improvements are larger than traditional methods indicate. We cannot reject the hypothesis that bidders on average pay fair prices. Combined bidder-target stock returns are higher for hostile offers, lower for equity offers, and lower for diversifying offers. These effects reflect revelation about bidder stand-alone value, not differences in gains from combination.","['Sanjai Bhagat', 'Ming Dong', 'David Hirshleifer', 'Robert Noah']","['Tender offers', 'Value improvements', 'Truncation dilemma', 'Revelation bias', 'Agency problems']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04001990,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,76,1,Sanjai Bhagat,2005,168.708979958124
Evidence on the speed of convergence to market efficiency,Daily returns for stocks listed on the New York Exchange (NYSE) are not serially correlated while order imbalances on the same stocks are highly persistent. These empirical facts can be reconciled if sophisticated investors react to order imbalances within the trading day by undertaking enough countervailing trades to remove serial dependence over a daily horizon.

"Integration, organizational processes, and allocation of resources","Does the level of integration of a firm affect the quality of information available to its top decision makers responsible for allocating resources? Motivated by the pervasiveness of specific knowledge in large multi-division firms, I develop a model of internal competition for corporate resources among specialist managers and show that: (i) managers of integrated firms exaggerate the payoffs of their projects to obtain resources despite potentially adverse career consequences, and (ii) the exaggeration problem worsens with increased integration and reduces the allocative efficiency of an integrated firm. Control rights based on asset ownership enable the firm to set “the rules of the game” and improve managerial behavior through organizational processes such as rigid capital budgets, job rotation, centralization and hierarchies.",['Oguzhan Ozbas'],"['Integration', 'Strategic communication', 'Allocation of resources']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04001485,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,75,1,Oguzhan Ozbas,2005,168.708979958124
Liquidity of emerging markets,"Emerging markets are characterized by volatile, but substantial returns that can easily exceed 75% per annum. Balancing these lofty returns are liquidity costs that, using the bid–ask spread as a basis, range from 1% for the Taiwanese market to over 47% for the Russian market. However, the paucity of bid–ask spread information across countries and time requires the use of liquidity estimates in emerging markets even though little is known about the efficacy of these estimates in measuring bid–ask spread costs. Using firm-level quoted bid–ask spreads as a basis, I find that price-based liquidity measures of Lesmond et al. [Review of Financial Studies 12 (1999) 1113] and Roll [Journal of Finance 39 (1984) 1127] perform better at representing cross-country liquidity effects than do volume based liquidity measures. Within-country liquidity is best measured with the liquidity estimates of either Lesmond, Ogden, and Trzcinka or, to a lesser extent, Amihud (2002). Examining the impact of legal origin and political institutions on liquidity levels shows that countries with weak political and legal institutions have significantly higher liquidity costs than do countries with strong political and legal systems, even to the exclusion of legal origin or insider trading enforcement. Higher incremental political risk is associated with a 10 basis point increase in transaction costs, using the Lesmond, Ogden, and Trzcinka estimate, or a 1.9% increase in price impact costs, using the Amihud estimate.",['David A.

It shows that government-owned banks increase their lending in election years relative to private banks. This effect is robust to controlling for country-specific macroeconomic and institutional factors as well as bank-specific factors.

Unchecked intermediaries: Price manipulation in an emerging stock market,"How costly is the poor governance of market intermediaries? Using unique trade level data from the stock market in Pakistan, we find that when brokers trade on their own behalf, they earn annual rates of return that are 50-90 percentage points higher than those earned by outside investors. Neither market timing nor liquidity provision by brokers can explain this profitability differential. Instead we find compelling evidence for a specific trade-based “pump and dump” price manipulation scheme: When prices are low, colluding brokers trade amongst themselves to artificially raise prices and attract positive-feedback traders. Once prices have risen, the former exit leaving the latter to suffer the ensuing price fall. Conservative estimates suggest these manipulation rents can account for almost a half of total broker earnings. These large rents may explain why market reforms are hard to implement and emerging equity markets often remain marginal with few outsiders investing and little capital raised.","['Asim Ijaz Khwaja', 'Atif Mian']","['Emerging markets', 'Price manipulation', 'Bubbles', 'Momentum trading', 'Market governance']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0500053X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,78,1,Asim Ijaz Khwaja,2005,168.708979958124
Dimensions of execution quality: Recent evidence for US equity markets,"I analyze market-order execution quality using order-based data reported in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 11Ac1-5. These data facilitate a comprehensive investigation of multiple dimensions of execution quality, including measures of costs and speed, for large samples of common stocks on Nasdaq and the NYSE. The evidence is consistent with competitive equity markets. Overall execution costs on Nasdaq exceed those on the NYSE, but orders execute faster. This relationship reverses for larger orders exceeding 1,999 shares. The apparent trade-off between costs and speed suggests that inferring execution quality from costs alone could be problematical.

Short- and long-term demand curves for stocks: theory and evidence on the dynamics of arbitrage,"I develop a framework to analyze demand curves for multiple risky securities at extended horizons in a setting with limits-to-arbitrage. Following an unexpected change in uninformed investor demand for several assets, I predict returns of each security to be proportional to the contribution of that security's demand shock to the risk of a diversified arbitrage portfolio. I show that securities that are not affected by demand shocks but are correlated with securities undergoing changes in demand should experience returns related to their hedging role in arbitrageurs' portfolios. Finally, I predict a negative cross-sectional relation between post-event returns and the initial return associated with the change in demand. I confirm these predictions using data from a unique redefinition of the Nikkei 225 index in Japan, in which 255 stocks simultaneously undergo significant changes in index investor demand, causing more than ¥2,000 billion of trading in one week and large price changes followed by subsequent reversals for all of the reweighted stocks.",['Robin Greenwood'],"['Limits-to-arbitrage', 'Event studies', 'Demand curves', 'Portfolio choice']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04001552,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,75,3,Robin Greenwood,2005,168.708979958124
An empirical examination of the costs and benefits of executive stock options: Evidence from Japan,"In May 1997, the Japanese Commercial Code was amended to allow firms to begin granting stock options as compensation to top management and employees. Nearly 350 firms adopted option-based compensation plans between 1997 and 2001. These options typically have five-year lives and are out-of-the-money by about 5% at the grant date. Firms exhibit abnormal stock returns of about 2% around the announcements of plan adoptions. We find improvements in operating performance and observe that dividend policy and volatility remain unchanged post-adoption.

Time-varying market integration and expected returns in emerging markets,"In the last two decades, emerging stock markets have become less segmented from world stock markets. The average annual decrease in segmentation of 0.055, on a [0,1] scale, reduces the cost of capital (measured by dividend yields) by about 11 basis points, and reduces stock returns by about 4.5%. The decline in expected returns is due to a decrease in two types of segmentation. A fall in local segmentation accounts for about 2/3 of the decline in expected returns. The remaining 1/3 is due to a fall in the level of segmentation of the region. These results, which we document for 30 emerging markets, are robust to the addition of control variables.","['Frank de Jong', 'Frans A. de Roon']","['Emerging markets', 'Asset pricing', 'Market segmentation']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05001108,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,78,3,Frank de Jong,2005,168.708979958124
"Institutions, ownership, and finance: the determinants of profit reinvestment among Chinese firms","Johnson et al. (2002. American Economic Review 92 (5), 1335–1356) examine the relative importance of property rights and external finance in several Eastern European countries. They find property rights to be overwhelmingly important, while external finance explains little of firm reinvestment. McMillan and Woodruff (2002. Journal of Economic Perspectives 16 (3), 153–170) further conjecture that as transition moves along, market-supporting (financial) institutions should become more important. This paper reexamines those issues in the context of China in 2002, when the transition had moved far. We also find that secure property rights are a significant predictor of firm reinvestment. However, in line with McMillan and Woodruff, we find that access to external finance in the form of bank loans is also associated with more reinvestment. Following Acemoglu and Johnson (2003. Unbundling institutions. Unpublished working paper 9934, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA), we separate our proxies for the security of property rights into two groups: those measuring the risk of expropriation by the government and those measuring the ease and reliability of contract enforcement. Whereas those authors’ cross-country results suggest that risk of expropriation is the more severe impediment to economic development, ours indicate that both expropriation risk and contract enforcement play a role in Chinese firms’ reinvestment decisions. We also find that another aspect of property rights, the extent of private ownership, is associated with greater reinvestment. At China's current stage of development, expropriation risk, contract enforcement, access to finance, and ownership structure all appear to matter for reinvestment decisions. Some evidence also exists that access to finance and government expropriation affect small firms more than large ones.","['Robert Cull', 'Lixin Colin Xu']","['China', 'Property rights', 'Banking', 'Investment']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0500019X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,77,1,Robert Cull,2005,168.708979958124
Why do some firms give stock options to all employees?: An empirical examination of alternative theories,"Many firms issue stock options to all employees. We consider three potential economic justifications for this practice: providing incentives to employees, inducing employees to sort, and employee retention. We gather data from three sources on firms’ stock option grants to middle managers. First, we directly calibrate models of incentives, sorting and retention, and ask whether observed magnitudes of option grants are consistent with each potential explanation. We also conduct a cross-sectional regression analysis of firms’ option-granting choices. We reject an incentives-based explanation for broad-based stock option plans, and conclude that sorting and retention explanations appear consistent with the data.","['Paul Oyer', 'Scott Schaefer']","['Employee compensation', 'Stock options', 'Incentives', 'Sorting', 'Retention']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04001357,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,76,1,Paul Oyer,2005,168.708979958124

Professional trader discipline and trade disposition,"Recent evidence indicates irrational behavior among retail investors. They hold onto losses and sell winners in a manner consistent with the disposition effect. Market professionals often use the term “discipline” to indicate trading strategies that minimize potential behavioral influences. We investigate the nature of trading discipline and whether professional traders are able to avoid the costly irrational behaviors found in retail populations. The full-time traders in our sample hold onto losses significantly longer than gains, but we find no evidence of costs associated with this behavior. The successful floor futures traders in our sample exhibit trading behavior characterized as rational and disciplined. Moreover, measures of relative trading discipline have predictive power for subsequent trading success.","['Peter R. Locke', 'Steven C.

Informational effects of regulation FD: evidence from rating agencies,"Regulation Fair Disclosure, implemented on October 23, 2000, prohibits U.S. public companies from making selective, nonpublic disclosures to favored investment professionals. Regulation Fair Disclosure has a number of exclusions, however, including disclosure of nonpublic information to credit rating agencies. As a result, credit analysts at rating agencies have access to confidential information that is no longer made available to equity analysts, potentially increasing the information content of credit ratings.

"Short sales, institutional investors and the cross-section of stock returns","Short-sale constraints are most likely to bind among stocks with low institutional ownership. Because of institutional constraints, most professional investors simply never sell short and hence cannot trade against overpricing of stocks they do not own. Furthermore, stock loan supply tends to be sparse and short selling more expensive when institutional ownership is low. Using institutional ownership as a proxy, I find that short-sale constraints help explain cross-sectional stock return anomalies. Specifically, holding size fixed, the under-performance of stocks with high market-to-book, analyst forecast dispersion, turnover, or volatility is most pronounced among stocks with low institutional ownership. Ownership by passive investors with large stock lending programs partly mitigates this under-performance, indicating some impact of stock loan supply. Prices of stocks with low institutional ownership also underreact to bad cash-flow news and overreact to good cash-flow news, consistent with the idea that short-sale constraints hold negative opinions off the market for these stocks.",['Stefan Nagel'],"['Return predictability', 'Short-sales constraints', 'Institutional investors']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05000735,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,78,2,Stefan Nagel,2005,168.708979958124

Detailed evidence from Mexico further shows that while some insiders exploited this weak legal enforcement with impunity, others that issued a cross-listing and passed through an economic downturn with a clean reputation went on to receive privileged long-term access to outside finance.

Global trends in IPO methods: Book building versus auctions with endogenous entry,"The U.S. book-building method has become increasingly popular for initial public offerings (IPOs) worldwide over the last decade, whereas sealed-bid IPO auctions have been abandoned in nearly all of the many countries in which they have been tried. I model book building, discriminatory auctions, and uniform price auctions in an environment in which the number of investors and the accuracy of investors’ information are endogenous. Book building lets underwriters manage investor access to shares, allowing them to reduce risk for both issuers and investors and to control spending on information acquisition, thereby limiting either underpricing or aftermarket volatility. Because more control and less risk are beneficial to all issuers, the advantages of book building's allocational flexibility could explain why global patterns of issuer choice are surprisingly consistent. My models also predict that offerings with higher expected underpricing have lower expected aftermarket volatility; that an auction open to large numbers of potential bidders is vulnerable to inaccurate pricing and to fluctuations in the number of bidders; and that both book-built and auctioned IPOs will exhibit partial adjustment to both private and public information.",['Ann E.

In particular, large banks are less willing to lend to informationally “difficult” credits, such as firms with no financial records.

Accounting transparency and the term structure of credit spreads,"Theory predicts that the quality of a firm's information disclosure can affect the term structure of its corporate bond yield spreads. Using cross-sectional regression and Nelson-Siegel yield curve estimation, I find that firms with higher Association for Investment Management and Research disclosure rankings tend to have lower credit spreads. Moreover, this transparency spread is especially large among short-term bonds. These findings are consistent with the theory of discretionary disclosure as well as the incomplete accounting information model of Duffie and Lando (Econometrica 69 (2001) 633). The presence of a sizable short-term transparency spread can attenuate some of the empirical problems associated with structural credit risk models.",['Fan Yu'],"['Term structure of credit spreads', 'Accounting transparency', 'Corporate disclosure quality']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04001321,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,75,1,Fan Yu,2005,168.708979958124
The dynamics of international equity market expectations,"This paper develops a noisy rational expectations model of the way in which international investors adjust their expectations of asset payoffs in a given country in response not only to public information signals but also to private information signals whose precision differs across investors. The model predicts that the perceptions of investors in one country about the future market returns in another country are related differently to realized past returns depending on their informational disadvantage relative to other investors: the greater is that informational disadvantage, the greater is the change in perception associated with returns. The predictions are confirmed by monthly survey data of institutional money managers investing in developed markets from 1995 to 2000.","['Michael J. Brennan', 'H.

What happened to liquidity when world war I shut the NYSE?,"This paper examines how financial markets responded to the longest circuit breaker in American financial history: the four-month suspension of trading on the New York Stock Exchange following the outbreak of World War I. The suspension that began on July 31, 1914 fostered a substitute trading forum called the New Street market. Trading on New Street began almost immediately and offered economically meaningful liquidity services despite its impaired price transparency. A simple cross-sectional model of bid–ask spreads on New Street demonstrates that New Street liquidity responded to economic incentives. New Street's success implies that, from a public policy perspective, expensive back-up trading facilities are not required to preserve liquidity during a trading suspension in established markets. Back-up records of share ownership and transfer facilities, however, are crucial to maintaining liquidity.",['William L.

Stock and bond market interaction: Does momentum spill over?,"This paper examines the interaction between momentum in the returns of equities and corporate bonds. We find that investment grade corporate bonds do not exhibit momentum at the three- to 12-month horizons. Instead, the evidence suggests that they exhibit reversals. However, significant evidence exists of a momentum spillover from equities to investment grade corporate bonds of the same firm. Firms earning high (low) equity returns over the previous year earn high (low) bond returns the following year. The spillover results are stronger among firms with lower-grade debt and higher equity trading volume, seem robust to various risk and liquidity controls, and hold even after controlling for past earnings surprises. In examining the source of the spillover, we find that the bond ratings of firms with positive (negative) equity momentum continue to improve (deteriorate) in the future, suggesting underreaction to the information in past equity prices about changing default risk is a likely source of the spillover effect. Overall, our results suggest that both equity and debt underreact to firm fundamentals, but past equity returns is a better proxy of firm fundamentals than past bond returns.","['William R.

You can’t always get what you want: Trade-size clustering and quantity choice in liquidity,"This paper examines whether investors care more about trading their exact quantity demands at some times than at others. Using a new data set of foreign exchange transactions, I find that customers trade more precise quantities at quarter-end, as evidenced by less trade-size clustering. Customers trade more odd lots and fewer round lots, while the number of trades and total volume are not significantly changed. I also find that the price impact of order flow is greater when customers care more about trading precise quantities.

The cross-section of expected corporate bond returns: Betas or characteristics?,"This paper finds that default betas are significantly related to the cross-section of average bond returns even after controlling for characteristics such as duration, ratings, and yield-to-maturity. Among characteristics, only yield-to-maturity is significantly related to average bond returns after controlling for default and term betas. The default and term factors are able to price the returns of beta-sorted portfolios better than they do the returns of yield-sorted portfolios. The magnitude of the ex ante Sharpe ratio generated by yield-sorted portfolios suggests non-risk-based explanations. Overall, given the elusive nature of systematic risk in empirical asset pricing, the central finding of our paper is that systematic risk matters for corporate bonds.","['William R.

Strategic trading behavior and price distortion in a manipulated market: anatomy of a squeeze,"This paper investigates an attempted delivery squeeze in a bond futures contract traded in London. Using cash and futures trades of dealers and customers, we analyze their strategic trading behavior, price distortion, and learning in a market manipulation setting. We argue that marked differences in settlement failure penalties in the cash and futures markets create conditions that favor squeezes. We recommend that regulators require special flagging of forward term repurchase agreements on the key deliverables that span futures contract maturity dates, and that exchanges mark-to-market their contract specifications more frequently, or consider a cash-settled contract on a basket of bonds.","['John J.

The costs of entrenched boards,"This paper investigates empirically how the value of publicly traded firms is affected by arrangements that protect management from removal. Staggered boards, which a majority of U.S. public companies have, substantially insulate boards from removal in either a hostile takeover or a proxy contest. We find that staggered boards are associated with an economically meaningful reduction in firm value (as measured by Tobin's Q). We also provide suggestive evidence that staggered boards bring about, and not merely reflect, a reduced firm value. Finally, we show that the correlation with reduced firm value is stronger for staggered boards that are established in the corporate charter (which shareholders cannot amend) than for staggered boards established in the company's bylaws (which shareholders can amend).","['Lucian A.

Shareholder investment horizons and the market for corporate control,"This paper investigates how the investment horizon of a firm's institutional shareholders impacts the market for corporate control. We find that target firms with short-term shareholders are more likely to receive an acquisition bid but get lower premiums. This effect is robust and economically significant: Targets whose shareholders hold their stocks for less four months, one standard deviation away from the average holding period of 15 months, exhibit a lower premium by 3%. In addition, we find that bidder firms with short-term shareholders experience significantly worse abnormal returns around the merger announcement, as well as higher long-run underperformance. These findings suggest that firms held by short-term investors have a weaker bargaining position in acquisitions. Weaker monitoring from short-term shareholders could allow managers to proceed with value-reducing acquisitions or to bargain for personal benefits (e.g., job security, empire building) at the expense of shareholder returns.","['José-Miguel Gaspar', 'Massimo Massa', 'Pedro Matos']","['Investment horizon', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Shareholder heterogeneity', 'Institutional investors', 'Short termism']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04001837,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,76,1,José-Miguel Gaspar,2005,168.708979958124
The risk and return of venture capital,"This paper measures the mean, standard deviation, alpha, and beta of venture capital investments, using a maximum likelihood estimate that corrects for selection bias. The bias-corrected estimation neatly accounts for log returns. It reduces the estimate of the mean log return from 108% to 15%, and of the log market model intercept from 92% to -7%. The selection bias correction also dramatically attenuates high arithmetic average returns: it reduces the mean arithmetic return from 698% to 59%, and it reduces the arithmetic alpha from 462% to 32%. I confirm the robustness of the estimates in a variety of ways.

Stock price clustering on option expiration dates,"This paper presents striking evidence that option trading changes the prices of underlying stocks. In particular, we show that on expiration dates the closing prices of stocks with listed options cluster at option strike prices. On each expiration date, the returns of optionable stocks are altered by an average of at least 16.5 basis points, which translates into aggregate market capitalization shifts on the order of $9 billion. We provide evidence that hedge rebalancing by option market makers and stock price manipulation by firm proprietary traders contribute to the clustering.","['Sophie Xiaoyan Ni', 'Neil D.

Financial intermediation as a beliefs-bridge between optimists and pessimists,"This paper proposes a new framework for understanding financial intermediation. In contrast to previous research, we consider a setting in which intermediaries possess no inherent information processing or monitoring advantages. Instead, in an economy with overly optimistic entrepreneurs who require funding from pessimistic investors, we show that intermediaries can arise endogenously. In such a setting, only a rational intermediary will be sufficiently optimistic to find it worthwhile to invest in a technology for screening entrepreneurs' projects, and yet be pessimistic enough to use this technology. Our framework produces implications consistent with heretofore unexplained stylized facts, and conjectures which are thus far untested.","['Joshua D. Coval', 'Anjan V.

"Investment timing, agency, and information","This paper provides a model of investment timing by managers in a decentralized firm in the presence of agency conflicts and information asymmetries. When investment decisions are delegated to managers, contracts must be designed to provide incentives for managers to both extend effort and truthfully reveal private information. Using a real options approach, we show that an underlying option to invest can be decomposed into two components: a manager's option and an owner's option. The implied investment behavior differs significantly from that of the first-best no-agency solution. In particular, greater inertia occurs in investment, as the model predicts that the manager will have a more valuable option to wait than the owner.","['Steven R.

On the suboptimality of single-factor exercise strategies for Bermudan swaptions,"This paper resolves the disagreement between Longstaff et al. [2001.

Journal of Financial Economics 62, 3–37] over the effectiveness of the common business practice of using best-fit single-factor term structure models to deduce exercise strategies of Bermudan swaptions. I examine the cost of using recalibrated single-factor models to determine the exercise strategy for Bermudan swaptions in a multifactor world. I show that single-factor exercise strategies applied in a multifactor world only give rise to economically insignificant losses. Furthermore, I find that the conditional model risk as defined in Longstaff et al. [2001. Journal of Finance Economics 62, 39–66] is statistically insignificant given the number of observations. Additional tests using the Primal–Dual algorithm of Andersen and Broadie [2004. Management Science 50(9)] indicate that losses found in Longstaff et al. [2001.

Asset pricing with liquidity risk,"This paper solves explicitly a simple equilibrium model with liquidity risk. In our liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model, a security's required return depends on its expected liquidity as well as on the covariances of its own return and liquidity with the market return and liquidity. In addition, a persistent negative shock to a security's liquidity results in low contemporaneous returns and high predicted future returns. The model provides a unified framework for understanding the various channels through which liquidity risk may affect asset prices. Our empirical results shed light on the total and relative economic significance of these channels and provide evidence of flight to liquidity.","['Viral V.

There is a risk-return trade-off after all,"This paper studies the intertemporal relation between the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the aggregate stock market return. We introduce a new estimator that forecasts monthly variance with past daily squared returns, the mixed data sampling (or MIDAS) approach. Using MIDAS, we find a significantly positive relation between risk and return in the stock market. This finding is robust in subsamples, to asymmetric specifications of the variance process and to controlling for variables associated with the business cycle. We compare the MIDAS results with tests of the intertemporal capital asset pricing model based on alternative conditional variance specifications and explain the conflicting results in the literature. Finally, we offer new insights about the dynamics of conditional variance.","['Eric Ghysels', 'Pedro Santa-Clara', 'Rossen Valkanov']","['Risk-return trade-off', 'ICAPM', 'MIDAS', 'Conditional variance']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05000140,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,76,3,Eric Ghysels,2005,168.708979958124
Explaining the size of the mutual fund industry around the world,"This paper studies the mutual fund industry in 56 countries and examines where this financial innovation has flourished. The fund industry is larger in countries with stronger rules, laws, and regulations, and specifically where mutual fund investors’ rights are better protected. The industry is also larger in countries with wealthier and more educated populations, where the industry is older, trading costs are lower and in which defined contribution pension plans are more prevalent. The industry is smaller in countries where barriers to entry are higher.

The “make or take” decision in an electronic market: Evidence on the evolution of liquidity,"This paper uses experimental asset markets to investigate the evolution of liquidity in an electronic limit order market. Our market setting includes salient features of electronic limit order markets, as well as informed traders and liquidity traders. We focus on the strategies of the traders and how these are affected by trader type, characteristics of the market, and characteristics of the asset. We find that informed traders use more limit orders than do liquidity traders. Our main result is that liquidity provision shifts as trading progresses, with informed traders increasingly providing liquidity in markets. The change in the behavior of the informed traders seems to be in response to the dynamic adjustment of prices to information; they take (provide) liquidity when the value of their information is high (low). Thus, a market-making role emerges endogenously in our electronic markets and is ultimately adopted by the traders who are least subject to adverse selection when placing limit orders.","['Robert Bloomfield', 'Maureen O’Hara', 'Gideon Saar']","['Microstructure', 'Limit orders', 'Liquidity']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0400131X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,75,1,Robert Bloomfield,2005,168.708979958124
Issuer surplus and the partial adjustment of IPO prices to public information,"This study develops a model in which rational issuers maximize the expected surplus from going public by choosing an offer price that weighs the benefit of higher proceeds if the offer is completed against the cost of foregone surplus if the offer fails. Increases in the market valuation of comparable firms during the waiting period imply higher surplus associated with going public; issuers respond with a partial revision in the offer price to elevate the probability of completion. The model offers insights into many facts associated with initial public offering pricing, including partial adjustment to market returns, the inverse relation between withdrawal and market returns, the asymmetric price adjustment to up versus down market returns, hot-issue markets, and unconditional underpricing.","['Roger M.

How much value can blockholders tunnel? Evidence from the Bulgarian mass privatization auctions,"This study examines the emergence of the Bulgarian stock market and the role of controlling blockholders. A new approach using mass privatization auction data measures the premium for control and demonstrates that, in the absence of legal constraints, majority owners extract more than 85% of firm value as private benefits of control. Institutional investors form portfolios of predominantly controlling positions or participate in majority coalitions. Ownership stakes cluster at 51%. After the privatized companies begin trading on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange, majority-owned firms trade at 40–60% discounts. Overall, the results support the Fama and Jensen (J. law Ecorg 26 (1983) 301) view that majority-owned firms cannot persist as publicly traded corporations if the expropriating activities of controlling blockholders are not legally restricted.",['Vladimir Atanasov'],"['Private benefits of control', 'Large shareholders']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04002053,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,76,1,Vladimir Atanasov,2005,168.708979958124
Valuation waves and merger activity: The empirical evidence,"To test recent theories suggesting that valuation errors affect merger activity, we develop a decomposition that breaks the market-to-book ratio (M/B) into three components: the firm-specific pricing deviation from short-run industry pricing; sector-wide, short-run deviations from firms’ long-run pricing; and long-run pricing to book. We find strong support for recent theories by Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan [2004. Market valuation and merger waves. Journal of Finance, forthcoming] and Shleifer and Vishny [2003. Stock market driven acquisitions. Journal of Financial Economics 70, 295–311], which predict that misvaluation drives mergers. So much of the behavior of M/B is driven by firm-specific deviations from short-run industry pricing, that long-run components of M/B run counter to the conventional wisdom: Low long-run value to book firms buy high long-run value-to-book firms. Misvaluation affects who buys whom, as well as method of payment, and combines with neoclassical explanations to explain aggregate merger activity.","['Matthew Rhodes–Kropf', 'David T. Robinson', 'S.

"Pricing, exit, and location decisions of firms: Evidence on the role of debt and operating efficiency","We compare pricing and exit decisions of discounters across the business cycle. Cities containing high debt and/or low efficiency firms display higher prices during non-recession years. During recessions, prices increase in cities with less efficient incumbents, but decrease in cities with a mix of high and low debt firms. High debt firms are more likely to exit cities with lower prices, and high debt exiting firms are more likely to be efficient. Apparently, low debt firms strategically lower prices during recessions to force exit of efficient, financially constrained rivals. Weaker competitors face another cost.

Crossborder dividend taxation and the preferences of taxable and nontaxable investors: Evidence from Canada,"We consider how fund managers respond to the conflicting preferences of their investors. We focus on the conflict between the taxable and retirement accounts of international funds, which face different tradeoffs between dividends and capital gains. In principle, managers could resolve this conflict through dividend arbitrage, but a proprietary database of dividend-arbitrage transactions shows that in practice they cannot. Thus, managers must resolve it through their investment policies. We find robust evidence that managers with more retirement money favor the preferences of retirement investors and further evidence for this view in the difference between U.S. and Canadian funds’ portfolio weights.","['Susan E.K.

The effect of external finance on the equilibrium allocation of capital,"We develop an equilibrium model to understand how the efficiency of capital allocation depends on outside investor protection and the external financing needs of firms. We show that when capital allocation is constrained by poor investor protection, an increase in firms' external financing needs may improve allocative efficiency by fostering the reallocation of capital from low to high productivity projects. We also find novel empirical support for this prediction.","['Heitor Almeida', 'Daniel Wolfenzon']","['Capital reallocation', 'Financial development', 'Investor protection', 'External finance']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0400128X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,75,1,Heitor Almeida,2005,168.708979958124
The choice between rights offerings and private equity placements,"We develop and test a nested logit model to examine how firms choose between a rights offering and a private equity placement. Family controlled firms avoid issue methods that dilute control benefits or subject them to more monitoring, especially when the family's control margin is small and the wedge between votes and capital is large. Control considerations also affect security design. Private placements reduce contracting and ex post holdup costs in new product market relationships. Finally, firms with higher asymmetric information about firm value tend to involve underwriter certification in a rights offering, and to choose a private placement when information asymmetries are extreme.","['Henrik Cronqvist', 'Mattias Nilsson']","['Seasoned equity offerings', 'Rights offerings', 'Private equity placements']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05000796,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,78,2,Henrik Cronqvist,2005,168.708979958124
"Management quality, certification, and initial public offerings","We empirically examine the relationship between the quality and reputation of a firm's management and various aspects of its IPO and post-IPO performance, a relationship that has so far received little attention in the literature. We hypothesize that better and more reputable managers are able to convey the intrinsic value of their firm more credibly to outsiders, thereby reducing the information asymmetry facing their firm in the equity market. Therefore, IPOs of firms with higher management quality will be characterized by lower underpricing, greater institutional interest, more reputable underwriters, and smaller underwriting expenses. Further, if higher management quality is associated with lower heterogeneity in investor valuations, firms with better managers will have greater long-term stock returns. Finally, since better managers are likely to select better projects (having a larger NPV for any given scale) and implement them more ably, higher management quality will also be associated with larger IPO offer sizes and stronger post-IPO operating performance. We present evidence consistent with the above hypotheses.","['Thomas J.

Interactions of corporate financing and investment decisions: The effects of agency conflicts,"We examine interactions between flexible financing and investment decisions in a model with stockholder–bondholder conflicts over investment policy. We find that financial flexibility encourages the choice of short-term debt thereby dramatically reducing the agency costs of under- and overinvestment. However, the reduction in agency costs may not encourage the firm to increase leverage, since the firm's initial debt level choice depends on the type of growth options in its investment opportunity set. The model has a number of testable predictions for the joint choice of leverage and maturity, and how these choices interact with a firm's growth opportunities.","['Paul D. Childs', 'David C.

Do hedge funds have enough capital? A value-at-risk approach,"We examine the risk characteristics and capital adequacy of hedge funds through the Value-at-Risk approach. Using extensive data on nearly 1,500 hedge funds, we find only 3.7% live and 10.9% dead funds are undercapitalized as of March 2003. Moreover, the undercapitalized funds are relatively small and constitute a tiny fraction of total fund assets in our sample. Cross-sectionally, the variability in fund capitalization is related to size, investment style, age, and management fee. Hedge fund risk and capitalization also display significant time variation. Traditional risk measures like standard deviation or leverage ratios fail to detect these trends.","['Anurag Gupta', 'Bing Liang']","['Hedge funds', 'Value-at-Risk', 'Capital adequacy', 'Extreme value theory', 'Monte Carlo simulation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05000206,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,77,1,Anurag Gupta,2005,168.708979958124
"Industry structure and horizontal takeovers: Analysis of wealth effects on rivals, suppliers, and corporate customers","We examine the wealth effects of horizontal takeovers on rivals of the merging firms, and on firms in the takeover industry's supplier and customer industries. Inconsistent with the collusion and buyer power motives, we find significant positive abnormal returns to rivals, suppliers, and corporate customers for the subsample of takeovers with positive combined wealth effect to target and bidder shareholders. Overall, our findings suggest that the average takeover in our sample is driven by efficiency considerations.

Does it pay to be loyal? An empirical analysis of underwriting relationships and fees,"We examine underwriting fees for repeat issuers of new securities to determine the relation between loyalty to an underwriting bank and the fees charged. For a sample of offers over the 1975–2001 period, we find that loyalty is associated with lower fees for common stock offers, consistent with valuable relationship capital being built through loyalty. For debt offers, however, we find the opposite pattern, consistent with relationship capital not being as valuable. For both offer types, firms that graduate to higher-quality banks face lower fees. Firms that are more likely to be switching banks to improve analyst coverage face higher fees for common stock offers, but not for debt offers.","['Timothy R.

Determinants and implications of arbitrage holdings in acquisitions,"We find evidence of passive and active roles for arbitrageurs in the acquisition process. Using a simultaneous-equation framework to recognize endogeneity, we analyze 608 acquisition bids over the 1992–1999 period. Our results indicate that the change in arbitrage holdings is greater in successful offers. However, changes in arbitrage holdings are also related to the probability of success, bid premia, and arbitrage returns. In addition, the change in arbitrage holdings is positively associated with both revision returns and the occurrence of subsequent bids. Overall, we find that merger arbitrageurs play an important role in the market for corporate control.","['Jim Hsieh', 'Ralph A.

Expected returns and expected dividend growth,"We investigate a consumption-based present-value relation that is a function of future dividend growth and find that changing forecasts of dividend growth are an important feature of the post-war U.S. stock market, despite the failure of the dividend–price ratio to uncover such variation. In addition, dividend forecasts are found to covary with changing forecasts of excess stock returns over business cycle frequencies. This covariation is important because positively correlated fluctuations in expected dividend growth and expected returns have offsetting effects on the log dividend–price ratio. The market risk premium and expected dividend growth thus vary considerably more than is apparent using the log divided–price ratio alone as a predictive variable.","['Martin Lettau', 'Sydney C.

The many facets of privately negotiated stock repurchases,"We investigate the causes and consequences of 737 privately negotiated share repurchases in the years 1984–2001. In contrast to the negative announcement returns and positive repurchase premiums reported by past research, we find positive announcement returns and premiums that are not significantly different from zero. Only when we investigate the 60 greenmail events separately do we find results similar to past research. However, for this subsample, we find long-horizon excess returns that are comparable to the average 18% repurchase premium, challenging the widely accepted opinion that managers overpay in greenmail repurchases. Moreover, we find that our understanding of the event improves when we split the non-greenmail repurchases according to the price paid. Repurchases at a premium can be modeled as signals, while other repurchases are mere wealth transfers between the corporation and the selling stockholders, the extent of which is determined by the relative bargaining power of the seller and the repurchasing firm.","['Urs C.

Postprivatization corporate governance: The role of ownership structure and investor protection,"We investigate the role of ownership structure and investor protection in postprivatization corporate governance. Using a sample of 209 privatized firms from 39 countries over the period 1980 to 2001, we find that the government relinquishes control over time to the benefit of local institutions, individuals, and foreign investors, and that private ownership tends to concentrate over time. Firm size, growth, and industry affiliation, privatization method, as well as the level of institutional development and investor protection, explain the cross-firm differences in ownership concentration. The positive effect of ownership concentration on firm performance matters more in countries with weak investor protection.","['Narjess Boubakri', 'Jean-Claude Cosset', 'Omrane Guedhami']","['Corporate governance', 'Privatization', 'Performance']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04002004,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,76,2,Narjess Boubakri,2005,168.708979958124
Optimal toeholds in takeover contests,We offer an explanation for why raiders do not acquire the maximum possible toehold prior to announcing a takeover bid. By endogenously modeling the target firm's value following an unsuccessful takeover we demonstrate that a raider may optimally acquire a small toehold even if the acquisition does not drive up the pre-tender target price. This occurs because although a larger toehold increases profits if the takeover succeeds it also conveys a higher level of managerial entrenchment and hence a lower firm value if the takeover fails. We derive new predictions regarding the optimal toehold and target value following a failed takeover. We also examine the impact of a rival bidder and dilution.,"['Eitan Goldman', 'Jun Qian']","['Toehold', 'Entrenchment', 'Free-Rider problem', 'Takeover', 'Tender offer']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05000358,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,77,2,Eitan Goldman,2005,168.708979958124
Dynamic risk management: Theory and evidence,"We present and test an infinite-horizon, continuous-time model of a firm that can dynamically adjust the use of risk management instruments which seek to reduce product price uncertainty and thereby mitigate financial distress losses and reduce taxes. The dynamic setting relaxes several restrictive assumptions common to static models. In the model, the firm can adjust its use and the hedge ratio and maturity of risk management instruments over time, risk management instruments expire as time progresses, the available maturity of the risk management instruments is shorter than the lifetime of the firm, and transaction costs are associated with initiation and adjustment of risk management contracts. The model produces a number of new time-series and cross-sectional implications on how firms use short-term instruments to hedge long-term cash flow uncertainty. Numerical results describe the optimal timing, adjustment, and rollover of risk management instruments and the choice of contract maturity and hedge ratio in response to changes in the firm's product price. The results show that the structure of transaction costs can have an important effect on the firm's risk management strategy. The model predicts that firms that are either far from financial distress or deep in financial distress neither initiate nor adjust their risk management instruments, while firms between the two extremes initiate and actively adjust their risk management instruments. Using quarterly panel data on gold mining firms between 1993 and 1999, we find evidence of a non-monotonic relation between measures of financial distress and risk management activity consistent with the model. We also provide evidence supportive of the model's predictions with respect to the maturity choice of risk management contracts.","['Frank Fehle', 'Sergey Tsyplakov']","['Dynamic risk management', 'Maturity choice', 'Hedge ratio', 'Distress', 'Transaction costs']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05000516,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,78,1,Frank Fehle,2005,168.708979958124
Why stocks may disappoint,"We provide a formal treatment of both static and dynamic portfolio choice using the Disappointment Aversion preferences of Gul (1991. Econometrica 59(3), 667–686), which imply asymmetric aversion to gains versus losses. Our dynamic formulation nests the standard CRRA asset allocation problem as a special case. Using realistic data generating processes, we find reasonable equity portfolio allocations for disappointment averse investors with utility functions exhibiting low curvature. Moderate variation in parameters can robustly generate substantial cross-sectional variation in portfolio holdings, including optimal non-participation in the stock market.","['Andrew Ang', 'Geert Bekaert', 'Jun Liu']","['First order risk aversion', 'Loss aversion', 'Portfolio choice', 'Downside risk']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05000164,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,76,3,Andrew Ang,2005,168.708979958124
"Earnings expectations, investor trade size, and anomalous returns around earnings announcements","We provide evidence that identifiable subsets of investors use significantly different information sets. Investors initiating large trades respond to analysts’ earnings forecast errors, while investors initiating small trades respond to a less-sophisticated signal that underestimates the implications of current earnings innovations for future earnings levels. This suggests small investors exhibit the behavior that Bernard and Thomas [Journal of Accounting and Economics 13, 305–340] theorize causes post-earnings announcement drift. We also use analysts’ forecasts to significantly improve the predictability of returns around earnings announcements previously documented by Bernard and Thomas.

Does financial liberalization spur growth?,"We show that equity market liberalizations, on average, lead to a 1% increase in annual real economic growth. The effect is robust to alternative definitions of liberalization and does not reflect variation in the world business cycle. The effect also remains intact when an exogenous measure of growth opportunities is included in the regression. We find that capital account liberalization also plays a role in future economic growth, but, importantly, it does not subsume the contribution of equity market liberalizations. Other simultaneous reforms only partially account for the equity market liberalization effect. Finally, the largest growth response occurs in countries with high-quality institutions.","['Geert Bekaert', 'Campbell R.

The direction of trade is most important, but we also find that the information effect increases with trade size in direct bilateral trades. All four dealers control their inventory intensively. Inventory control is not, however, manifested through a dealer's own prices in contrast to findings by Lyons (J. Financial Econ. 39(1995) 321).

We characterize the timing dimension of the decision to go public and its impact on firm value and the evolution of firm risk over time. By endogenizing the timing of the decision to go public, we explain the clustering of IPOs and buyouts in time, the industry concentration of IPO waves, the high incidence of reprivatization of recent IPOs, and the long-run underperformance of recently issued stock relative to the shares of longer-listed companies.","['Simon Benninga', 'Mark Helmantel', 'Oded Sarig']","['IPO', 'Privatization', 'Timing', 'Underpricing']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04001291,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,75,1,Simon Benninga,2005,168.708979958124
News spillovers in the sovereign debt market,"We study the effect of a sovereign credit rating change of one country on the sovereign credit spreads of other countries from 1991 to 2000. We find evidence of spillover effects; that is, a ratings change in one country has a significant effect on sovereign credit spreads of other countries. This effect is asymmetric: positive ratings events abroad have no discernable impact on sovereign spreads, whereas negative ratings events are associated with an increase in spreads. On average, a one-notch downgrade of a sovereign bond is associated with a 12 basis point increase in spreads of sovereign bonds of other countries. The magnitude of the spillover effect following a negative ratings change is amplified by recent ratings changes in other countries. We distinguish between common information and differential components of spillovers. While common information spillovers imply that sovereign spreads move in tandem, differential spillovers are expected to result in opposite effects of ratings events across countries. Despite the predominance of common information spillovers, we also find evidence of differential spillovers among countries with highly negatively correlated capital flows or trade flows vis-á-vis the United States. That is, spreads in these countries generally fall in response to a downgrade of a country with highly negatively correlated capital or trade flows. Variables proxying for cultural or institutional linkages (e.g., common language, formal trade blocs, common law legal systems), physical proximity, and rule of law traditions across countries do not seem to affect estimated spillover effects.","['Amar Gande', 'David C.

Inflation risk premia and the expectations hypothesis,"We study the properties of the nominal and real risk premia of the term structure of interest rates. We develop and solve the bond pricing implications of a structural monetary version of a real business cycle model, with taxes and endogenous monetary policy. We show the relation of this model with the class of essentially affine models that incorporate an endogenous state-dependent market price of risk. We characterize and estimate the inflation risk premium and find that over the last 40 years the ten-year inflation risk premium has been has averaged 70 basis points. It is time-varying, ranging from 20 to 140 basis points over the business cycle and its term structure is sharply upward sloping. The inflation risk premium explains 23% (42%) of the time variation in the five (ten)-year forward risk premium and it plays an important role in help explain deviations from the expectations hypothesis of interest rates.","['Andrea Buraschi', 'Alexei Jiltsov']","['Term structure', 'Bond prices', 'Inflation', 'Expectations hypothesis', 'Risk premium']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04001333,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,75,2,Andrea Buraschi,2005,168.708979958124
Is value riskier than growth?,"We study the relative risk of value and growth stocks. We find that time-varying risk goes in the right direction in explaining the value premium. Value betas tend to covary positively, and growth betas tend to covary negatively with the expected market risk premium. Our inference differs from that of previous studies because we sort betas on the expected market risk premium, instead of on the realized market excess return. However, we also find that this beta-premium covariance is too small to explain the observed magnitude of the value premium within the conditional capital asset pricing model.","['Ralitsa Petkova', 'Lu Zhang']","['Value', 'Growth', 'Time-varying expected returns']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X05000929,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.019022659689834853,78,1,Ralitsa Petkova,2005,168.708979958124
Payout policy in the 21st century,"We survey 384 financial executives and conduct in-depth interviews with an additional 23 to determine the factors that drive dividend and share repurchase decisions. Our findings indicate that maintaining the dividend level is on par with investment decisions, while repurchases are made out of the residual cash flow after investment spending. Perceived stability of future earnings still affects dividend policy as in Lintner (1956. American Economic Review 46, 97–113). However, 50 years later, we find that the link between dividends and earnings has weakened. Many managers now favor repurchases because they are viewed as being more flexible than dividends and can be used in an attempt to time the equity market or to increase earnings per share. Executives believe that institutions are indifferent between dividends and repurchases and that payout policies have little impact on their investor clientele. In general, management views provide little support for agency, signaling, and clientele hypotheses of payout policy. Tax considerations play a secondary role.","['Alon Brav', 'John R.

Reversals are more pronounced and stock returns are lower for sued firms than for those that are not sued. The incidence of lawsuits involving stock offers and settlement amounts are significantly positively related to abnormal accruals around the offer and significantly negatively related to post-offer stock returns.

Are dividends disappearing? Dividend concentration and the consolidation of earnings,"Aggregate real dividends paid by industrial firms increased over the past two decades even though, as Fama and French (J. Financial Econ. 60, 3) (2001a) document, the number of dividend payers decreased by over 50%. The reason is that (i) the reduction in payers occurs almost entirely among firms that paid very small dividends, and (ii) increased real dividends from the top payers swamp the modest dividend reduction from the loss of many small payers. These trends reflect high and increasing concentration in the supply of dividends which, in turn, reflects high and increasing earnings concentration. For example, the 25 firms that paid the largest dividends in 2000 account for a majority of the aggregate dividends and earnings of industrial firms. Industrial firms exhibit a two-tier structure in which a small number of firms with very high earnings collectively generates the majority of earnings and dominates the dividend supply, while the vast majority of firms has at best a modest collective impact on aggregate earnings and dividends.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Douglas J Skinner']","['Dividends', 'Payout policy', 'Earnings concentration', 'Losses']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001867,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,3,Harry DeAngelo,2004,168.62483582846906

We find that accounting for fat tails leads to nontrivial changes in both parameter estimates and optimal portfolio weights, but the certainty–equivalent losses associated with ignoring fat tails are small. This suggests that the normality assumption works well in evaluating portfolio performance for a mean-variance investor.","['Jun Tu', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Asset pricing tests: Investments', 'Data generating process', 't distribution', 'Bayesian analysis']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002472,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,2,Jun Tu,2004,168.62483582846906
Why are foreign firms listed in the U.S. worth more?,"At the end of 1997, foreign companies with shares cross-listed in the U.S. had Tobin's q ratios that were 16.5% higher than the q ratios of non-cross-listed firms from the same country. The valuation difference is statistically significant and reaches 37% for those companies that list on major U.S. exchanges, even after controlling for a number of firm and country characteristics. We suggest that a U.S. listing reduces the extent to which controlling shareholders can engage in expropriation and thereby increases the firm's ability to take advantage of growth opportunities. We show that growth opportunities are more highly valued for firms that choose to cross-list in the U.S., particularly those from countries with poorer investor rights.","['Craig Doidge', 'G.Andrew Karolyi', 'René M Stulz']","['International cross-listings', 'Valuation', 'Controlling shareholders', 'Governance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001831,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,71,2,Craig Doidge,2004,168.62483582846906
"Tick size, NYSE rule 118, and ex-dividend day stock price behavior","Bali and Hite (1998) and Dubofsky (1992) propose models in which market microstructure effects play a role in the ex-dividend day price drop anomaly. Bali and Hite suggest that the anomaly is caused solely by price discreteness, while Dubofsky suggests that NYSE Rule 118 is also involved. We test these models by examining cum- to ex-day price drops during the one-eighth, one-sixteenth, and decimal tick size regimes. While the evidence is qualitatively consistent with Dubofsky's predictions, neither model is satisfactory in a quantitative sense. One of our main empirical findings is that no significant decline was evident in the magnitude of the ex-day anomaly after the tick size reduction.","['Keith Jakob', 'Tongshu Ma']","['Ex-dividend day price drop', 'Tick size', 'NYSE Rule 118']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001892,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,3,Keith Jakob,2004,168.62483582846906
Corporate earnings and the equity premium,"Corporate cash flows are highly volatile and strongly procyclical. We examine the asset-pricing implications of the sensitivity of corporate cash flows to economic shocks within a continuous-time model in which dividends are a stochastic fraction of aggregate consumption. We provide closed-form solutions for stock values and show that the equity premium can be represented as the sum of three components which we call the consumption-risk, event-risk, and corporate-risk premia. Calibrated to historical data, the model implies a total equity premium many times larger than in the standard model. The model also generates levels of equity volatility consistent with those experienced in the stock market.","['Francis A.

Order preferencing and market quality on NASDAQ before and after decimalization,"Despite the widely held belief that order preferencing affects market quality, no hard evidence exists on the extent and determinants of order preferencing and its impact on dealer competition and execution quality. This study shows that the bid-ask spread (dealer quote aggressiveness) is positively (negatively) related to the proportion of internalized volume during both the pre- and post-decimalization periods. Although decimal pricing led to lower order preferencing on NASDAQ, the extent of order preferencing after decimalization is higher than what prior studies had predicted. The price impact of preferenced trades is smaller than that of unpreferenced trades and preferenced trades receive greater (smaller) size (price) improvements than unpreferenced trades.","['Kee H Chung', 'Chairat Chuwonganant', 'D.Timothy McCormick']","['Decimalization', 'Internalization', 'Payment for order flow', 'Quote aggressiveness', 'Spreads', 'Execution quality']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001740,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,71,3,Kee H Chung,2004,168.62483582846906
Corporate governance and firm value: evidence from the Korean financial crisis,"During the 1997 Korean financial crisis, firms with higher ownership concentration by unaffiliated foreign investors experienced a smaller reduction in their share value. Firms that had higher disclosure quality and alternative sources of external financing also suffered less. In contrast, chaebol firms with concentrated ownership by controlling family shareholders experienced a larger drop in the value of their equity. Firms in which the controlling shareholders’ voting rights exceeded cash flow rights and those who borrowed more from the main banks also had lower returns.

Tax-loss trading and wash sales,"Finnish investors realize losses more than gains toward the end of December. Moreover, they repurchase the same stocks recently sold. The repurchase rate depends on loss magnitude, firm size, and how late in the year the sale takes place. This trading pattern generates net tax-loss buying pressure that is negative prior to the turn of the year and positive afterward.

Earnings management and the market performance of acquiring firms,"I examine the market's efficiency in processing manipulated accounting reports and provide an explanation for the post-merger underperformance anomaly. I find strong evidence suggesting that acquiring firms overstate their earnings in the quarter preceding a stock swap announcement. I also find evidence of a reversal of the stock price effects of the earnings management in the days leading to the merger announcement. However, the pre-merger reversal is only partial. I find evidence of a post-merger reversal of the stock price effects of the pre-merger earnings management. The results suggest that the extant evidence of post-merger underperformance by acquiring firms is partly attributable to the reversal of the price effects of earnings management. The study also suggests that the post-merger reversal is not fully anticipated by financial analysts in the month immediately following the merger announcement. However, consistent with suggestions in the financial press that managers guide analysts’ forecasts to “beatable” levels, the effect of the earnings management reversal seems to be reflected in the consensus analysts’ forecasts by the time of the subsequent quarterly earnings releases.",['Henock Louis'],"['Merger', 'Earnings management', 'Market efficiency', 'Analyst forecast']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000534,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,74,1,Henock Louis,2004,168.62483582846906

We analyze how this capture affects the loan portfolio allocation of informed lenders. First, we show that banks charge higher interest rates and finance relatively less creditworthy borrowers in market segments with greater information asymmetries. Second, when faced with greater competition from outside lenders, banks reallocate credit toward more captured borrowers (flight to captivity). Third, if borrower quality and captivity are sufficiently correlated, an increase in the competitiveness of uninformed lenders can worsen the informed lender's overall loan portfolio. The model explains observed consequences of financial liberalizations.","[""Giovanni Dell'Ariccia"", 'Robert Marquez']","['Bank competition', 'Credit allocation', 'Cross-border liberalization']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002101,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,1,Giovanni Dell'Ariccia,2004,168.62483582846906

New lists: Fundamentals and survival rates,"The class of firms that obtain public equity financing expands dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s. The number of new firms listed on major U.S. stock markets jumps from 156 per year for 1973–1979 to 549 per year for 1980–2001. The characteristics of new lists also change. The cross section of profitability becomes progressively more left skewed, and growth becomes more right skewed. The result is a sharp decline in survival rates. We suggest that the changes in the characteristics of new lists are due to a decline in the cost of equity that allows weaker firms and firms with more distant expected payoffs to issue public equity.","['Eugene F Fama', 'Kenneth R French']","['New lists', 'IPOs', 'Survival', 'Profitability', 'Growth']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000315,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,73,2,Eugene F Fama,2004,168.62483582846906

This study develops a simple, parsimonious model for the market maker's spread that accounts for the effects of price discreteness induced by minimum tick size, order-processing costs, inventory-holding costs, adverse selection, and competition. The inventory-holding and adverse selection cost components of spread are modeled as an option with a stochastic time to expiration. This inventory-holding premium embedded in the spread represents compensation for the price risk borne by the market maker while the security is held in inventory. The premium is partitioned in such a way that the inventory-holding and adverse selection cost components, as well as the probability of an informed trade, are identified. The model is tested empirically using Nasdaq stocks in three distinct minimum tick size regimes and is shown to perform well both in an absolute sense and relative to competing specifications.","['Nicolas P.B.

The costs of shared ownership: Evidence from international joint ventures,"This paper analyzes the determinants of partial ownership of the foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational firms and, in particular, the marked decline in the use of joint ventures over the last 20 years. The evidence indicates that whole ownership is most common when firms coordinate integrated production activities across different locations, transfer technology, and benefit from worldwide tax planning. Because operations and ownership levels are jointly determined, it is helpful to use the liberalization of ownership restrictions by host countries and the imposition of joint venture tax penalties in the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 as instruments for ownership levels to identify these effects. Firms responded to these regulatory and tax changes by using wholly owned affiliates instead of joint ventures and expanding intrafirm trade and technology transfer. The implied complementarity of whole ownership and intrafirm trade suggests that the reduced costs of engaging in integrated global operations contributed substantially to the sharply declining propensity of American firms to organize their foreign operations as joint ventures over the last two decades. Estimates imply that as much as one-fifth to three-fifths of the decline in the use of joint ventures by multinational firms is attributable to the increased importance of intrafirm transactions. The forces of globalization appear to have diminished, rather than accelerated, the use of shared ownership.","['Mihir A Desai', 'C.Fritz Foley', 'James R Hines']","['Organizational form', 'Joint ventures', 'Intrafirm transactions', 'Taxation', 'Multinational firms']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000121,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,73,2,Mihir A Desai,2004,168.62483582846906
Portfolio choice and health status,"This paper analyzes the role health status plays in household portfolio decisions using data from the Health and Retirement Study. The results indicate that health is a significant predictor of both the probability of owning different types of financial assets and the share of financial wealth held in each asset category. Households in poor health are less likely to hold risky financial assets, other things (including the level of total wealth) being the same. Poor health is associated with a smaller share of financial wealth held in risky assets and a larger share in safe assets. We find no evidence that the relationship between health status and portfolio allocation is driven by “third variables” that simultaneously affect health and financial decisions. Further, the relationship between health status and portfolio choice does not appear to operate through the effect of poor health on individuals’ attitudes toward risk, their planning horizons, or their health insurance status.","['Harvey S Rosen', 'Stephen Wu']","['Portfolio', 'Health', 'Risk']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001788,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,3,Harvey S Rosen,2004,168.62483582846906
The timing and terms of mergers motivated by economies of scale,"This paper analyzes the timing of mergers motivated by economies of scale. We show that firms have an incentive to merge in periods of economic expansion. Relaxing the assumption that firms are price takers, we find that market power strengthens the firms’ incentive to merge and speeds up merger activity. Finally, comparing mergers with hostile takeovers we show that the way merger synergies are divided not only influences the acquirer's and the acquiree's returns from merging, but also the timing of the restructuring.",['Bart M Lambrecht'],"['Merger waves', 'Real option', 'Economies of scale']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002423,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,1,Bart M Lambrecht,2004,168.62483582846906
The effect of capital structure when expected agency costs are extreme,"This paper conducts powerful new tests of whether debt can mitigate the effects of agency and information problems. We focus on emerging market firms for which pyramid ownership structures create potentially extreme managerial agency costs. Our tests incorporate both traditional financial statement data and new data on global debt contracts. Our analysis is mindful of the potential endogeneity between debt, ownership structure, and value, and it takes into account differences in the debt capacity of a firm's assets in place and future growth opportunities. The results indicate that the incremental benefit of debt is concentrated in firms with high expected managerial agency costs that are also most likely to have overinvestment problems resulting from high levels of assets in place or limited future growth opportunities. Subsequent internationally syndicated term loans are particularly effective at creating value for these firms. Our results support the recontracting hypothesis that equity holders value compliance with monitored covenants, particularly when firms are likely to overinvest.","['Campbell R. Harvey', 'Karl V.

Bailout and conglomeration,"This paper develops a model of business groups in emerging markets where banks cannot accurately distinguish between good (high productivity) and bad (low productivity) borrower firms. For stand-alone firms, banks can infer the proportion of bad firms among those that default on contracted debt repayments, and might optimally choose to liquidate all defaulting firms in order to reduce the number of bad firms. Business groups, however, obscure the productivity of individual firms. The optimal policy might then be full bailout so as not to risk eliminating good firms. Given the bank's bailout policy, risk-averse firms might form a conglomerate to reduce the risk of liquidation.",['Se-Jik Kim'],"['Bailout', 'Business groups', 'Bank loans', 'Institutions']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001910,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,71,2,Se-Jik Kim,2004,168.62483582846906
The timing and value of forecast and recommendation revisions,"This paper evaluates the information content of analysts’ one-quarter-ahead earnings forecast revisions and recommendation revisions at various points in event time relative to earnings announcement dates. Across three sets of tests, we find that the revisions are least informative in the week after earnings announcements and that the information content of revisions generally increases over event time. We find a sharp increase in the information content of upward forecast revisions and recommendation upgrades in the week before earnings announcements, but we do not find a similar increase for downward revisions or for recommendation downgrades.","['Zoran Ivković', 'Narasimhan Jegadeesh']","['Financial markets', 'Brokerage analysts', 'Earnings forecasts', 'Analysts’ recommendations', 'Asymmetric information']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000522,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,73,3,Zoran Ivković,2004,168.62483582846906
The choice of equity-selling mechanisms,"This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry and monitoring of managers on the choice between public offerings and private placements. Three key findings emerge. First, private placement firms have higher information asymmetry than public offering firms. Second, private placement investors do not engage in more monitoring than public offering investors.

Banking market structure and financial stability: Evidence from the Texas real estate crisis in the 1980s,"This paper examines the relationship between banking market structure and financial stability. Using data on thrifts, a type of banking institution specializing in residential mortgage lending, I test two related hypotheses. First, competition reduces franchise value. Second, reduced franchise value induces risk taking. Testing the second hypothesis exploits predictions that when hit by an exogenous shock, the slope of risk with respect to franchise value becomes more negative because thrifts adopt “bang-bang” strategies and choose minimal or maximal risk. Using the Texas real estate collapse in the 1980s as a natural experiment, I find evidence supporting both hypotheses.",['Jie Gan'],"['Market structure', 'Moral hazard', 'Bank risk', 'Franchise value', 'Financial stability']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000728,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,73,3,Jie Gan,2004,168.62483582846906
Testing market efficiency using statistical arbitrage with applications to momentum and value strategies,"This paper introduces the concept of statistical arbitrage, a long horizon trading opportunity that generates a riskless profit and is designed to exploit persistent anomalies. Statistical arbitrage circumvents the joint hypothesis dilemma of traditional market efficiency tests because its definition is independent of any equilibrium model and its existence is incompatible with market efficiency. We provide a methodology to test for statistical arbitrage and then empirically investigate whether momentum and value trading strategies constitute statistical arbitrage opportunities. Despite adjusting for transaction costs, the influence of small stocks, margin requirements, liquidity buffers for the marking-to-market of short-sales, and higher borrowing rates, we find evidence that these strategies generate statistical arbitrage.","['Steve Hogan', 'Robert Jarrow', 'Melvyn Teo', 'Mitch Warachka']","['Statistical arbitrage', 'Market efficiency', 'Momentum', 'Value']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000947,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,73,3,Steve Hogan,2004,168.62483582846906
Is the IPO pricing process efficient?,"This paper investigates underwriters’ treatment of public information throughout the IPO pricing process. Two key findings emerge. First, public information is not fully incorporated into the initial price range. While the economic magnitude of the bias is small, it is puzzling because it is not clear who benefits from it. Further, it indicates that the filing range midpoint is not an unbiased predictor of the offer price, as prior literature has assumed. Second, while public information is similarly not fully incorporated into the final offer price, the small economic significance of this relation indicates that the IPO pricing process is almost efficient.","['Michelle Lowry', 'G.William Schwert']","['IPO', 'Underpricing', 'Private information', 'Learning', 'Market efficiency']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002058,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,71,1,Michelle Lowry,2004,168.62483582846906
The illiquidity puzzle: theory and evidence from private equity,"This paper presents the theory that managers can use the liquidity of securities as a choice variable to screen for deep-pocket investors, those that have a low likelihood of facing a liquidity shock. We assume an information asymmetry about the quality of the manager between the existing investors and the market. The manager then faces a lemons problem when he has to raise funds for a subsequent fund from outside investors, because the outsiders cannot determine whether the manager is of poor quality or the existing investors were hit by a liquidity shock. Thus, liquid investors can reduce the manager's cost of capital in future fundraising. We test the assumptions and predictions of our model in the context of the private equity industry. Consistent with the theory, we find that transfer restrictions on investors are less common in later funds organized by the same private equity firm, where information problems are presumably less severe. Also, partnerships whose investment focus is in industries with longer investment cycles display more transfer constraints. Finally, we present evidence consistent with the assumptions of our model, including the high degree of continuity in the investors of successive funds and the ability of sophisticated investors to anticipate funds that will have poor subsequent performance.","['Josh Lerner', 'Antoinette Schoar']","['Corporate finance', 'Liquidity', 'Fundraising', 'Venture capital']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002034,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,1,Josh Lerner,2004,168.62483582846906
Estimating the market risk premium,This paper provides a method for estimating the market risk premium that accounts for shifts in investment opportunities by explicitly modeling the underlying process governing the level of market volatility. I find that approximately 50% of the measured risk premium is related to the risk of future changes in investment opportunities. Evidence of a structural shift in the underlying volatility process suggests that the simple historical average of excess market returns may substantially overstate the magnitude of the market risk premium for the period since the Great Depression.,['E Scott Mayfield'],"['Risk premium', 'Asset pricing', 'Structural breaks', 'Markov-switching models']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0400073X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,73,3,E Scott Mayfield,2004,168.62483582846906
Order imbalance and individual stock returns: Theory and evidence,"This paper studies the relation between order imbalances and daily returns of individual stocks. Our tests are motivated by a model which considers how market makers dynamically accommodate autocorrelated imbalances emanating from large traders who optimally choose to split their orders. Price pressures caused by autocorrelated imbalances cause a positive relation between lagged imbalances and returns, which reverses sign after controlling for the current imbalance. We find empirical evidence consistent with these implications. We also find that imbalance-based trading strategies yield statistically significant returns.

The effects of government ownership on bank lending,"This paper uses information on individual loan contracts to study the effects of government ownership on bank lending behavior. State-owned banks charge lower interest rates than do privately owned banks to similar or identical firms, even if firms are able to borrow more from privately owned banks. State-owned banks mostly favor large firms and firms located in depressed areas. The lending behavior of state-owned banks is affected by the electoral results of the party affiliated with the bank: the stronger the political party in the area where the firm is borrowing, the lower the interest rates charged.",['Paola Sapienza'],"['Banking', 'Government', 'Ownership']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002459,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,2,Paola Sapienza,2004,168.62483582846906
Institutional trading and the turn-of-the-year effect,"This study provides evidence that links institutional trading behavior directly to anomalous turn-of-the-year return patterns of small stocks. We find that turn-of-the-year trading patterns of institutions reflect strategies generally consistent with window-dressing and risk-shifting behaviors. Institutions sell more loser small stocks in the last quarter of the year, but buy more small stocks, winners and losers, in the first quarter. Institutional buying (selling) of loser stocks at year-end weakens (strengthens) the turn-of-the-year effect. Buying of winner stocks after year-end causes a statistically significant, though weaker, effect.","['Lilian Ng', 'Qinghai Wang']","['Institutions', 'Window-dressing', 'Risk-shifting', 'Turn-of-the-year effect']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000741,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,74,2,Lilian Ng,2004,168.62483582846906
Investibility and return volatility,"Unlike previous studies that examine how emerging market return volatility changes subsequent to stock market liberalization, this paper investigates the impact of investibility, or the degree to which a stock can be foreign-owned, on emerging market volatility. We find a positive relation between return volatility and the investibility of individual stocks, even after controlling for country, industry, firm size, and turnover. We also find that a highly investible emerging market portfolio is subject to larger world market exposure than a non-investible portfolio, suggesting that highly investible stocks are more integrated with the world and therefore more vulnerable to world market risk.","['Kee-Hong Bae', 'Kalok Chan', 'Angela Ng']","['Emerging market', 'Stock return volatility', 'Investibility', 'Market integration']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001661,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,71,2,Kee-Hong Bae,2004,168.62483582846906
The basis risk of catastrophic-loss index securities,"Using a windstorm simulation model developed by Applied Insurance Research, we analyze the effectiveness of catastrophic-loss index options in hedging hurricane losses for Florida insurers. The results suggest that insurers in the two largest size quartiles can hedge losses almost as effectively using contracts based on four intrastate indices as they can using contracts that settle on their own losses. Many insurers in the third largest size quartile also can hedge effectively using the intrastate indices, but most insurers in the smallest quartile would encounter significant basis risk. Hedging using a statewide loss index is effective only for the largest insurers.","['J.David Cummins', 'David Lalonde', 'Richard D.

Style effects in the cross-section of stock returns,"Using CRSP stock and mutual fund data, we find strong evidence for reversals at the style level (e.g., large value, small growth, etc.). There are significant excess and risk-adjusted returns for stocks in styles characterized by the worst past returns and net inflows. We also find evidence for momentum and positive feedback trading at the style level. These value and momentum effects are driven neither by fundamental risk nor by stock-level reversals and momentum.

Internal capital markets and investment policy: evidence from corporate spinoffs,"We analyze changes in investment policy following 106 spinoffs between 1981 and 1996. Pre-spinoff, the sample firms are valued at a discount and invest less in their high q segments than do their single-segment peers. Post-spinoff, there is a significant increase in measures of investment efficiency and the diversification discount is eliminated. Furthermore, changes in excess value around the spinoff are positively related to changes in measures of investment efficiency. These findings support the view that (i) diversified firms allocate investment funds inefficiently, and (ii) by breaking up the conglomerate, spinoffs create value by improving investment efficiency.","['Seoungpil Ahn', 'David J Denis']","['Internal capital markets', 'Spinoffs', 'Diversification']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0300165X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,71,3,Seoungpil Ahn,2004,168.62483582846906

We find that internal investments exhibit a positive correlation across the firms divisions. Namely, when two single-division firms merge the optimal investment level in one division becomes more positively related to the investment level in the other division. In addition, following a spinoff, divisional investments decline (increase) whenever the separated division has a project with a low (high) Sharpe ratio. Finally, multidivision firms trade at a discount which is larger the more diverse the investment sets of the divisions.",['Eitan Goldman'],"['Internal markets', 'Resource allocation', 'Spinoff', 'Information production']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001776,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,71,1,Eitan Goldman,2004,168.62483582846906
Market evidence on the opaqueness of banking firms’ assets,"We assess the market microstructure properties of U.S. banking firms’ equity, to determine whether they exhibit more or less evidence of asset opaqueness than similar-sized nonbanking firms. The evidence indicates that large bank holding companies (BHC), traded on the NYSE, have very similar trading properties to their matched nonfinancial firms. In contrast, smaller BHCs, traded on NASDAQ, trade much less frequently despite having very similar spreads. Analysis of IBES earnings forecasts indicates that banking assets are not unusually opaque; they are simply boring.

Management turnover in subsidiaries of conglomerates versus stand-alone firms,"We compare turnover of subsidiary managers inside conglomerate firms to turnover of CEOs of comparable stand-alone firms. We find that, compared to turnover of CEOs, subsidiary manager turnover is significantly more sensitive to changes in performance and significantly more likely following poor performance. For subsidiary managers, the relation between turnover and performance is significantly stronger when the subsidiary operates in an industry that is related to the parent's primary industry. Results suggest that boards of directors are relatively ineffective disciplinarians of CEOs and despite their other apparent failings, conglomerate firms have relatively strict disciplining mechanisms for subsidiary managers.","['Chris McNeil', 'Greg Niehaus', 'Eric Powers']","['Management turnover', 'Internal labor market', 'Conglomerates']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001909,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,1,Chris McNeil,2004,168.62483582846906
A theory of corporate spin-offs,"We develop a new rationale for corporate spin-offs, and for the performance and value improvements following them, based on corporate control considerations. We consider a firm with multiple divisions, with incumbent management having different abilities for managing these divisions. If the incumbent loses control to a more able rival, it benefits all shareholders (including the incumbent) by increasing equity value, but involves the incumbent losing his private benefits of control. We show that a spin-off increases the incumbent's chance of losing control to such a rival. This, in turn, motivates the incumbent either to work harder at managing the firm (in order to avoid any loss of control), or to relinquish control of one of the firms resulting from the spin-off (either immediately following the spin-off, or subsequently in a control contest). We show that spin-offs will be associated with positive announcement effects and increases in long-term operating performance. Further, certain categories of spin-offs will exhibit long-term positive abnormal stock returns.","['Thomas J.

The effect of capital market characteristics on the value of start-up firms,"We develop an equilibrium model of contracting, bargaining, and search in which the relative scarcity of venture capital affects the bargaining power of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. This in turn affects the pricing, contracting, and value creation in start-ups. The relative scarcity of venture capital is endogenous and depends on the profitability of venture capital investments, entry costs, and transparency of the venture capital market. Supply and demand conditions also affect the incentives of venture capitalists to screen projects ex ante. We characterize both the short- and long-run dynamics of the venture capital industry, which provides us with a stylized picture of the Internet boom and bust periods.

No such relationship exists for a control sample of matched non-issuers. Issuers with the greatest institutional investment are also found to have the highest ratio of sell-side analyst upgrades less downgrades to total forecasts in the two quarters following the issue.

The equally weighted abnormal announcement return is 1.1%, but acquiring-firm shareholders lose $25.2 million on average upon announcement. This disparity suggests the existence of a size effect in acquisition announcement returns. The announcement return for acquiring-firm shareholders is roughly two percentage points higher for small acquirers irrespective of the form of financing and whether the acquired firm is public or private.

Managerial succession and firm performance,"We examine CEO turnover and firm financial performance. Accounting measures of performance relative to other firms deteriorate prior to CEO turnover and improve thereafter. The degree of improvement is positively related to the level of institutional shareholdings, the presence of an outsider-dominated board, and the appointment of an outsider (rather than an insider) CEO. Turnover announcements are associated with significantly positive average abnormal stock returns, which are in turn significantly positively related to subsequent changes in accounting measures of performance.

We find that increases in price and volume occur after informed trades. During informed trading, market makers decrease depth. Depth falls more on the NYSE and Amex than on the Nasdaq. Spreads increase on the NYSE and Amex, but not on the Nasdaq. We find none of these pre-release changes in a nontraded control sample of stocks mentioned in the column.

Business (1992) 509) prediction that upstairs brokers lower execution costs by tapping into unexpressed liquidity, as actual execution costs upstairs are on average only 20% (35%) as large as they would be if block trades were executed against displayed (displayed and hidden) liquidity in the downstairs limit order book. Consistent with prior analyses, the Paris data also support the Seppi (J. Finance (1990) 73) hypothesis that upstairs brokers certify trades as uninformed. We also find that participants in stocks with less restrictive crossing rules agree to outside-the-quote executions for more difficult trades and at times when downstairs liquidity is lacking. These likely represent trades that could not have been otherwise completed, suggesting that market quality can be enhanced by allowing participants more flexibility to execute blocks at prices outside the quotes.","['Hendrik Bessembinder', 'Kumar Venkataraman']","['Upstairs market', 'Limit order book', 'Electronic exchange', 'Crossing rules']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0400011X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,73,1,Hendrik Bessembinder,2004,168.62483582846906
"Grandstanding, certification and the underpricing of venture capital backed IPOs","We examine the role of venture capital backing in the underpricing of IPOs. Controlling for endogeneity in the receipt of venture funding, we find that venture capital backed IPOs experience larger first-day returns than comparable non-venture backed IPOs. Between 1980 and 2000, the average return difference ranges from 5.01 percentage points to 10.32 percentage points. This return difference is particularly pronounced in the “bubble” period of 1999–2000. Consistent with the grandstanding hypothesis proposed by Gompers (J. Financial Econ. 42 (1996) 133), we find that higher underpricing leads to larger future flows of capital into venture capital funds, particularly after 1996. Cross-sectionally, the effect of underpricing is attenuated for younger venture capital firms and those that have previously conducted fewer IPOs.","['Peggy M.

Determinants of target capital structure: The case of dual debt and equity issues,"We examine whether market and operating performance affect corporate financing behavior because they are related to target leverage. Our focus on firms that issue both debt and equity enhances our ability to draw inferences. Consistent with dynamic trade-off theories, dual issuers offset the deviation from the target resulting from accumulation of earnings and losses. Our results also imply that high market-to-book firms have low target debt ratios. On the other hand, consistent with market timing, high stock returns increase the probability of equity issuance but have no effect on target leverage.","['Armen Hovakimian', 'Gayane Hovakimian', 'Hassan Tehranian']","['Capital structure', 'Target leverage', 'Equity market timing', 'Dual issues']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001818,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,71,3,Armen Hovakimian,2004,168.62483582846906

Limited arbitrage and short sales restrictions: evidence from the options markets,"We investigate empirically the well-known put–call parity no-arbitrage relation in the presence of short sales restrictions. Violations of put–call parity are asymmetric in the direction of short sales constraints, and their magnitudes are strongly related to the cost and difficulty of short selling. These violations are also related to both the maturity of the option and the level of valuations in the stock market, consistent with a behavioral finance theory of over-optimistic stock investors and market segmentation. Moreover, both the size of put–call parity violations and the cost of short selling are significant predictors of future returns for individual stocks.","['Eli Ofek', 'Matthew Richardson', 'Robert F.

We construct a data set that identifies the corporate customers, suppliers, and rivals of the firms initiating horizontal mergers and use this data set to examine announcement-related stock market revaluations and post-merger changes in operating performance. We find little evidence consistent with increased monopolistic collusion.

Further, the market recognizes these performance differences in the five-day period surrounding the recommendation revision. This market reaction, however, is incomplete. Excess returns in the one and three trading months following the revision are significant and positively associated with analysts’ prior performance.

We document significant lead-lag correlations between the moments that also appear related to business cycles. Finally, we show that although the conditional correlation between the mean and volatility is negative, the unconditional correlation is positive due to these lead-lag correlations.","['Michael W.

Cross-country determinants of mergers and acquisitions,"We study the determinants of mergers and acquisitions around the world by focusing on differences in laws and regulation across countries. We find that the volume of M&A activity is significantly larger in countries with better accounting standards and stronger shareholder protection. The probability of an all-cash bid decreases with the level of shareholder protection in the acquirer country. In cross-border deals, targets are typically from countries with poorer investor protection than their acquirers’ countries, suggesting that cross-border transactions play a governance role by improving the degree of investor protection within target firms.","['Stefano Rossi', 'Paolo F.

Leverage decision and manager compensation with choice of effort and volatility,"We study the incentive effects of granting levered or unlevered stock to a risk-averse manager. The stock is granted by risk-neutral shareholders who choose leverage and compensation level. The manager applies costly effort and selects the level of volatility, both of which affect expected return. The results are driven by the attempt of the risk-neutral shareholders to maximize the value of their claims net of the compensation package. We consider a dynamic setting and find that levered stock is optimal for high-type managers, firms with high momentum, large firms, and firms for which additional volatility only implies a modest increase in expected return.","['Abel Cadenillas', 'Jakša Cvitanić', 'Fernando Zapatero']","['Capital structure', 'Principal-agent', 'Stochastic control']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000133,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,73,1,Abel Cadenillas,2004,168.62483582846906

Our evidence suggests that independent directors have a bargaining advantage over the CEO that results in compensation more closely aligned with shareholders’ objectives. Firms with more outsiders on their boards award directors more equity-based compensation. When the CEO's power over the board increases, compensation provides weaker incentives to monitor. Firms with more inside directors and with entrenched CEOs use less equity-based pay.

Many different functions have been suggested, but no standard has emerged. We emphasize that consistency in the choice of loss functions is crucial. First, for any given model, the loss function used in parameter estimation and model evaluation should be the same, otherwise suboptimal parameter estimates may be obtained. Second, when comparing models, the estimation loss function should be identical across models, otherwise inappropriate comparisons will be made. We illustrate the importance of these issues in an application of the so-called Practitioner Black-Scholes model to S&P 500 index options.","['Peter Christoffersen', 'Kris Jacobs']","['Implied volatility functions', 'Valuation errors', 'Out-of-sample forecasting', 'Parameter stability']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002447,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.10318094429980214,72,2,Peter Christoffersen,2004,168.62483582846906

Boundaries of the firm: evidence from the banking industry,"Agency theory implies that asset ownership and decision authority are complements. Using 1998 data from Texas commercial banks, we test whether the likelihood of local ownership of bank offices increases with the importance of granting local managers greater decision authority (for example, due to location or customer base). Our empirical evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. It suggests that complementarities between strategy and organizational structure can foster differentiation among firms in terms of location, customers, and products. It also supports the growing view that small locally-owned banks have a comparative advantage over large banks within specific environments.","['James A Brickley', 'James S Linck', 'Clifford W Smith']","['Boundaries of the firm', 'Banking', 'Economics of organizations', 'Ownership incentives', 'Agency theory', 'Decision authority', 'Locational decisions', 'Riegle–Neal Act', 'Community banks', 'Interstate branching']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001703,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,70,3,James A Brickley,2003,168.54069169881416
Likelihood-based specification analysis of continuous-time models of the short-term interest rate,"An extensive collection of continuous-time models of the short-term interest rate is evaluated over data sets that have appeared previously in the literature. The analysis, which uses the simulated maximum likelihood procedure proposed by Durham and Gallant (2002), provides new insights regarding several previously unresolved questions. For single factor models, I find that the volatility, not the drift, is the critical component in model specification. Allowing for additional flexibility beyond a constant term in the drift provides negligible benefit. While constant drift would appear to imply that the short rate is nonstationary, in fact, stationarity is volatility-induced. The simple constant elasticity of volatility model fits weekly observations of the three-month Treasury bill rate remarkably well but is easily rejected when compared with more flexible volatility specifications over daily data. The methodology of Durham and Gallant can also be used to estimate stochastic volatility models. While adding the latent volatility component provides a large improvement in the likelihood for the physical process, it does little to improve bond-pricing performance.",['Garland B.

Debtor-in-possession financing and bankruptcy resolution: Empirical evidence,"Debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing is unique secured financing available to firms filing for Chapter 11. Opponents of DIP financing argue that it leads to overinvestment. Alternatively, DIP financing can allow funding for positive net present value projects that increase the likelihood of reorganization and reduce time in bankruptcy. Using a large sample of bankruptcy filings, we find little evidence of systematic overinvestment. DIP financed firms are more likely to emerge from Chapter 11 than non-DIP financed firms. DIP financed firms have a shorter reorganization period; they are quicker to emerge and also quicker to liquidate. The reorganization period is even shorter when prior lenders provide the DIP financing.","['Sandeep Dahiya', 'Kose John', 'Manju Puri', 'Gabriel Ramı́rez']","['Chapter 11', 'Bankruptcy', 'Debtor-in-possession financing']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001132,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,69,1,Sandeep Dahiya,2003,168.54069169881416

Stockholders incorporate predictable discounting in stock prices when equity offers are first announced. The surprise component of discounting, reflecting the lead bank's final adjustment to the offer price, releases information that often causes economically large price swings on the offer day. Disparities between the issuer's closing price and the price suggested in the lead bank's final order book are a primary source of information. The discount surprise appears to be used by lead banks to update capital suppliers with that eleventh-hour information before they commit their funds.","['Oya Altınkılıç', 'Robert S Hansen']","['Underwriters', 'Seasoned public offerings', 'Investment banking', 'Underpricing']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001144,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,69,2,Oya Altınkılıç,2003,168.54069169881416

Directors are rarely retained following a completed offer. All target directors hold fewer directorships in the future than a control group, suggesting that the target board seat is difficult to replace. For outside directors, the direct financial impact of a completed merger is predominately negative. This documents a cost to outside directors should they fail as monitors, forcing the external control market to act for them. Future seats are related to pre-bid performance.

Valuation effects of bank financing in acquisitions,"In a sample of 115 cash tender offers between 1990 and 1996, banks extend financing in 70% of the tender offers and finance the entire tender offer in half of these takeovers. Bank financing of tender offers is more likely when internal cash reserves are low. Acquisitions that are entirely financed by banks are associated with large and significantly positive acquirer announcement returns. Announcement returns are also positively related to the fraction of the acquisition value financed by bank debt. The benefits of bank financing are most important for both poorly performing acquirers and acquirers facing substantial informational asymmetries.

Our results indicate that the value of switching from daily to intradaily returns to estimate the conditional covariance matrix can be substantial. We estimate that a risk-averse investor would be willing to pay 50 to 200 basis points per year to capture the observed gains in portfolio performance. Moreover, these gains are robust to transaction costs, estimation risk regarding expected returns, and the performance measurement horizon.","['Jeff Fleming', 'Chris Kirby', 'Barbara Ostdiek']","['Volatility timing', 'Realized volatility', 'Portfolio optimization', 'Mean-variance analysis', 'Rolling estimators']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002593,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,67,3,Jeff Fleming,2003,168.54069169881416
Control benefits and CEO discipline in automatic bankruptcy auctions,"Swedish bankruptcy filing automatically terminates the employment of the chief executive officer (CEO) and triggers an auction of the firm. Critics of this system warn of excessive shareholder risk-shifting incentives prior to filing. We argue that private benefits of control induce managerial conservatism that may override shareholder risk-shifting incentives. By investing conservatively, the CEO increases the joint probability that the auction results in a going-concern sale and that the CEO is rehired. This uniquely implies that the rehiring probability is increasing in private control benefits, which our empirical results support. We also find that buyers in the auction screen on CEO quality. Overall, labor market discipline is dramatic, as filing CEOs suffer large income losses relative to CEOs of matched, non-bankrupt firms. Firms emerging from auction bankruptcy appear healthy as they typically go on to perform at par with industry rivals.","['B Espen Eckbo', 'Karin S Thorburn']","['Bankruptcy', 'Auctions', 'Liquidation', 'Restructuring', 'Risk shifting', 'Asset substitution', 'Managerial conservatism', 'Executive compensation', 'CEO turnover', 'Post-bankruptcy performance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001260,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,69,1,B Espen Eckbo,2003,168.54069169881416
The maturity of debt issues and predictable variation in bond returns,"The maturity of new debt issues predicts excess bond returns. When the share of long-term debt issues in total debt issues is high, future excess bond returns are low. This predictive power comes in two parts. First, inflation, the real short-term rate, and the term spread predict excess bond returns. Second, these same variables explain the long-term share, and together account for much of its own ability to predict excess bond returns. The results are consistent with survey evidence that firms use debt market conditions in an effort to determine the lowest-cost maturity at which to borrow.","['Malcolm Baker', 'Robin Greenwood', 'Jeffrey Wurgler']","['Maturity structure', 'Term structure', 'Interest rates', 'Market efficiency']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001478,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,70,2,Malcolm Baker,2003,168.54069169881416
Cronyism and capital controls: evidence from Malaysia,"The onset of the Asian financial crisis in Malaysia reduced the expected value of government subsidies to politically connected firms, accounting for roughly 9% of the estimated $60 billion loss in their market value from July 1997 to August 1998. Firing the Deputy Prime Minister and imposing capital controls in September 1998 primarily benefited firms with strong ties to Prime Minister Mahathir, accounting for roughly 32% of these firms’ estimated $5 billion gain in market value during September 1998.

Termination fees in mergers and acquisitions,"The paper provides evidence on the effects of including a target termination fee in a merger contract. I test the implications of the hypothesis that termination fees are used by self-interested target managers to deter competing bids and protect “sweetheart” deals with white knight bidders, presumably resulting in lower premiums for target shareholders. An alternative hypothesis is that target managers use termination fees to encourage bidder participation by ensuring that the bidder is compensated for the revelation of valuable private information released during merger negotiations. My empirical evidence demonstrates that merger deals with target termination fees involve significantly higher premiums and success rates than deals without such clauses. Furthermore, only weak support is found for the contention that termination fees deter competing bids. Overall, the evidence suggests that termination fee use is at least not harmful, and is likely beneficial, to target shareholders.",['Micah S Officer'],"['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Takeovers', 'Termination fees', 'Takeover premiums']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001193,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,69,3,Micah S Officer,2003,168.54069169881416
A closing call's impact on market quality at Euronext Paris,"The Paris Bourse (currently Euronext Paris) refined its trading system to include electronic call auctions at market closings in 1996 for its less-liquid Continuous B stocks and in 1998 for its more actively traded Continuous A stocks. This paper analyzes the effects of the innovation on market quality. Our empirical analysis of price behavior for two samples of firms (50 B stocks and 50 A stocks) for two different calendar dates (1996 and 1998) indicates that introduction of the closing calls has lowered execution costs for individual participants and sharpened price discovery for the broad market. We further observe that market quality is improved at market openings, albeit to a lesser extent. We suggest that a positive spillover effect explains the closing call's more pervasive impact.","['Michael S. Pagano', 'Robert A.

The great reversals: the politics of financial development in the twentieth century,"The state of development of the financial sector does not change monotonically over time. In particular, by most measures, countries were more financially developed in 1913 than in 1980 and only recently have they surpassed their 1913 levels. To explain these changes, we propose an interest group theory of financial development where incumbents oppose financial development because it breeds competition. The theory predicts that incumbents’ opposition will be weaker when an economy allows both cross-border trade and capital flows. This theory can go some way in accounting for the cross-country differences in, and the time-series variation of, financial development.","['Raghuram G Rajan', 'Luigi Zingales']","['Financial markets', 'Growth', 'Politics', 'Financial development', 'Reversals', 'Trade', 'Capital flows']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001259,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,69,1,Raghuram G Rajan,2003,168.54069169881416
Allocation of initial public offerings and flipping activity,"There is a general perception that the large trading volume in initial public offerings is mostly due to “flippers” that are allocated shares in the offering and immediately resell them. On average, however, flipping accounts for only 19% of trading volume and 15% of shares offered during the first two days of trading. Institutions do more flipping than retail customers and hot IPOs are flipped much more than cold IPOs.

How do family strategies affect fund performance? When performance-maximization is not the only game in town,"This is a first attempt to study how the structure of the industry affects mutual fund behavior. I show that industry structure matters; the mutual fund families employ strategies that rely on the heterogeneity of the investors in terms of investment horizon by offering the possibility to switch across different funds belonging to the same family at no cost. I argue that this option acts as an externality for all the funds belonging to the same family, affecting the target level of performance the family wants to reach and the number of funds it wants to set up.",['Massimo Massa'],"['Mutual funds', 'Market structure', 'Performance', 'Behavioral finance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002532,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,67,2,Massimo Massa,2003,168.54069169881416
The calendar structure of risk and expected returns on stocks and bonds,"This paper documents, for 1947–2000, seasonalities in economic activity, stock and bond returns, and relationships among them. Evidence is consistent with an annual cycle view of economic activity and risk conditions. The power of lagged stock returns to forecast economic activity is greater for quarters ending in December and March. Mean excess returns on NYSE stocks in October through March account for 78–107% of their annual means and reflect a seasonal asymmetric return reversal tendency, which in turn explains low long-horizon variance ratios. Both market losses in April through September and subsequent returns in October through March are related, but with opposing signs, to October through March economic activity. The forecasting power of five variables is greatest for October through March. Tests of an asset-pricing model indicate that expected returns vary both cross-sectionally and over time.

Earnings management and investor protection: an international comparison,"This paper examines systematic differences in earnings management across 31 countries. We propose an explanation for these differences based on the notion that insiders, in an attempt to protect their private control benefits, use earnings management to conceal firm performance from outsiders. Thus, earnings management is expected to decrease in investor protection because strong protection limits insiders’ ability to acquire private control benefits, which reduces their incentives to mask firm performance. Our findings are consistent with this prediction and suggest an endogenous link between corporate governance and the quality of reported earnings.","['Christian Leuz', 'Dhananjay Nanda', 'Peter D Wysocki']","['Corporate governance', 'Earnings management', 'Investor protection', 'Law', 'Private control benefits']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001211,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,69,3,Christian Leuz,2003,168.54069169881416

We examine the impact of IPO underpricing on website traffic, which is a direct measure of product market performance for internet firms. If underpricing attracts media attention and creates valuable publicity, we expect an increase in web traffic following the IPO. We find that web traffic growth in the month after the IPO is positively and significantly associated with initial returns, and the effect is economically significant. We also investigate media reaction to initial returns for a broader sample of IPOs. The results suggest that the marketing benefits of underpricing extend beyond the internet sector and the “hot issues” market of the late 1990s.","['Elizabeth Demers', 'Katharina Lewellen']","['IPO', 'Underpricing', 'Marketing', 'Internet', 'Web traffic']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000722,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,68,3,Elizabeth Demers,2003,168.54069169881416

The model's focus on executive project selection decisions highlights the multidimensional nature of executive choices that affect the value of the firm. An executive not only makes an effort choice that determines the quality of information on which to base a decision but also sets the decision criteria for selecting projects. A project selection framework is also shown to introduce endogenous uncertainty into compensation that can influence the executive's effort choice. Using an extensive data set, our empirical work supports the main hypotheses of the model, including the significance of executive rank in determining the extent of use of incentive pay in general and equity-based incentive pay in particular.","['John M.

It finds that ordinary inventories best explain dealer firms’ quote placement strategy, which dealer firm executes trades, and the quality of execution offered to the trades.

The value of controlblock votes varies widely across countries. It is close to half of firm market value in South Korea, and close to zero in Finland. The value of control-block votes is interpreted as a lower bound for actual private benefits of the controlling shareholder.

A barrier option framework for corporate security valuation,"This paper proposes a framework for corporate security valuation based on path-dependent, barrier option models instead of the commonly used path-independent approach. We argue that path dependency is an intrinsic and fundamental characteristic of corporate securities because equity can be knocked out whenever a legally binding barrier is breached. A direct implication of this framework is that equity will be priced as a down-and-out call option. We provide empirical validation of the barrier model by showing that implied barriers are statistically and economically significant for a large cross-section of industrial firms. Additional robustness tests confirm that barriers remain significant over a wide range of input variable estimates. And finally, we apply the barrier option framework to bankruptcy prediction and find that implied failure probabilities dominate Z-scores in most cases.","['Paul Brockman', 'H.J.

Convergence is improved greatly; in the extrapolated scheme, a doubling of points can reduce error by a factor of 256. Complex problems (e.g., fixed-strike lookback discrete barrier options) can be evaluated accurately and orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods.","['Ari D.

Capital structure and product markets interactions: evidence from business cycles,"This paper provides firm- and industry-level evidence of the effects of capital structure on product market outcomes for a large cross-section of industries over a number of years. The analysis uses shocks to aggregate demand as surrogates for exogenous changes in the product market environment. I find that debt financing has a negative impact on firm (relative-to-industry) sales growth in industries in which rivals are relatively unlevered during recessions, but not during booms. In contrast, no such effects are observed for firms competing in high-debt industries. At the industry level, markups are more countercyclical when industry debt is high. The cyclical dynamics I find for firm sales growth and for industry markups are consistent with Chevalier and Scharfstein's (American Economic Review (1996)) prediction that firms which rely heavily on external financing are more likely to cut their investment in market share building in response to negative shocks to demand and that the competitive outcomes resulting from such actions depend on the financial structures of their industry rivals.",['Murillo Campello'],"['Product markets', 'Capital structure', 'Business cycles', 'Industry rivalry', 'Markups']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000709,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,68,3,Murillo Campello,2003,168.54069169881416
Capital structure choice: macroeconomic conditions and financial constraints,"This paper provides new evidence of how macroeconomic conditions affect capital structure choice. We model firms’ target capital structures as a function of macroeconomic conditions and firm-specific variables. We split our sample based on a measure of financial constraints. Target leverage is counter-cyclical for the relatively unconstrained sample, but pro-cyclical for the relatively constrained sample. Macroeconomic conditions are significant for issue choice for unconstrained firms but less so for constrained firms.

Arbitrage risk and the book-to-market anomaly,"This paper shows that the book-to-market (B/M) effect is greater for stocks with higher idiosyncratic return volatility, higher transaction costs, and lower investor sophistication, consistent with the market-mispricing explanation for the anomaly. The B/M effect for high volatility stocks exceeds that for the low volatility stocks in 20 of the 22 sample years. Also, volatility exhibits significant incremental power beyond transaction costs and investor sophistication measures in explaining cross-sectional variation in the B/M effect. These findings are consistent with the Shleifer and Vishny (1997) thesis that risk associated with the volatility of arbitrage returns deters arbitrage activity and is an important reason why the B/M effect exists.","['Ashiq Ali', 'Lee-Seok Hwang', 'Mark A.

Corporate governance and firm profitability: evidence from Korea before the economic crisis,"This study examines how ownership structure and conflicts of interest among shareholders under a poor corporate governance system affected firm performance before the crisis. Using 5,829 Korean firms subject to outside auditing during 1993–1997, the paper finds that firms with low ownership concentration show low firm profitability, controlling for firm and industry characteristics. Controlling shareholders expropriated firm resources even when their ownership concentration was small. Firms with a high disparity between control rights and ownership rights showed low profitability. When a business group transferred resources from a subsidiary to another, they were often wasted, suggesting that “tunneling” occurred. In addition, the negative effects of control-ownership disparity and internal capital market inefficiency were stronger in publicly traded firms than in privately held ones.",['Sung Wook Joh'],"['Corporate governance', 'Ownership', 'Profitability', 'Shareholder expropriation', 'Business group']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000680,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,68,2,Sung Wook Joh,2003,168.54069169881416
Quote-based competition and trade execution costs in NYSE-listed stocks,"This study examines quotations, order routing, and trade execution costs for seven markets that compete for orders in large-capitalization NYSE-listed stocks. The competitiveness of quote updates from each market varies with measures of the profitability of attracting additional order and with volatility and inventory measures. The probability of a trade executing on each market increases when the market posts competitive quotes. Execution costs for non-NYSE trades when the local market posts competitive (non-competitive) quotes are virtually the same (substantially exceed) costs for matched NYSE trades. Collectively, these results imply a significant degree of quote-based competition for order flow and are consistent with off-NYSE liquidity providers using competitive quotations to signal when they are prepared to give better-than-normal trade executions.",['Hendrik Bessembinder'],"['Competition for order flow', 'Quotation strategies', 'Trading costs']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001685,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,70,3,Hendrik Bessembinder,2003,168.54069169881416

Firms with the highest credit quality borrow from public sources, firms with medium credit quality borrow from banks, and firms with the lowest credit quality borrow from non-bank private lenders. Non-bank private debt thus plays a unique role in accommodating the financing needs of firms with low credit quality.

An examination of own account trading by dual traders in futures markets,"Using proprietary audit trail transaction data compiled by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we investigate at the individual trader level (1) the timing and (2) the determinants of dual traders’ personal trades. Our analysis reveals an absence of any trade timing by dual traders in relation to the execution of their customers’ orders. Further examination employing correlation statistics and time series regressions provides strong support for the proposition that dual traders supply liquidity and actively manage inventory. Even after simultaneously controlling for factors representing information, liquidity supply, and inventory control, within a multivariate regression framework, liquidity supply and inventory control remain as the determinants of dual traders’ personal trades.

Evidence from our analysis of major fund restructuring decisions, including share repurchases, open-ending proposals and right offerings, is largely consistent with the expense ratio analysis. Overall, board characteristics that we identify with effective board independence are associated with lower expense ratios and value-enhancing restructurings.","['Diane Del Guercio', 'Larry Y Dann', 'M.Megan Partch']","['Closed-end funds', 'Boards of directors', 'Corporate governance', 'Open-endings', 'Repurchases', 'Rights offerings']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001107,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,69,1,Diane Del Guercio,2003,168.54069169881416
Payment for order flow,"We develop a dynamic model of price competition in broker and dealer markets. With no payment for order flow, a zero-profit equilibrium exists. With payment for order flow, spreads widen to more than compensate for this payment; hence, there is no equilibrium in which market makers earn zero profits. While brokerage commissions for market orders can fall, the total transactions cost to submitting a market order remains positive. Consumer and social welfare are both lower in any equilibrium with payment for order flow; payment for order flow redistributes payoffs from traders who demand liquidity to those who supply it.","['Christine A.

A multivariate model of strategic asset allocation,We develop an approximate solution method for the optimal consumption and portfolio choice problem of an infinitely long-lived investor with Epstein–Zin utility who faces a set of asset returns described by a vector autoregression in returns and state variables. Empirical estimates in long-run annual and post-war quarterly U.S. data suggest that the predictability of stock returns greatly increases the optimal demand for stocks. The role of nominal bonds in long-term portfolios depends on the importance of real interest rate risk relative to other sources of risk. Long-term inflation-indexed bonds greatly increase the utility of conservative investors.,"['John Y. Campbell', 'Yeung Lewis Chan', 'Luis M.

China share issue privatization: the extent of its success,"We evaluate the performance changes of 634 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) listed on China's two exchanges upon share issuing privatisation (SIP) in the period 1994–1998. We find that SIP is effective in improving SOEs’ earnings ability, real sales, and workers’ productivity but is not successful in improving profit returns and leverage after privatisation. We also find state ownership having negative impacts on firm performance and legal-person ownership having positive impacts on firm performance after SIP, which suggests that legal persons behave differently from the state government. Surprisingly, foreign ownership does not show uniformly strong, positive impacts on firm performance.","['Qian Sun', 'Wilson H.S Tong']","['China', 'Partial privatization', 'State-owned enterprise', 'Performance change', 'Restructuring']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001454,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,70,2,Qian Sun,2003,168.54069169881416
"Executive stock option repricing, internal governance mechanisms, and management turnover","We examine firms that reprice their executive stock options and find little evidence that repricing reflects managerial entrenchment or ineffective governance. Repricing grants are economically significant, but there is little else unusual about compensation in repricing firms. Repricers tend to be smaller, younger, rapidly growing firms that experience a deep, sudden shock to growth and profitability. They are also more concentrated in the technology, trade, and service sectors and have smaller boards of directors. Repricers have abnormally high CEO turnover rates, which is inconsistent with the entrenchment hypothesis. Over 40% of repricers exclude the CEO's options when they reprice.","['N.K.

Breaking up is hard to do? An analysis of termination fee provisions and merger outcomes,"We examine the provision of termination fee clauses in merger agreements between 1989 and 1998. Target-payable fees are observed more frequently when bidding is costly and the potential for information expropriation by third parties is significant. Fee provisions appear to benefit target shareholders through higher deal completion rates and greater negotiated takeover premiums. We conclude that target-payable fees serve as an efficient contracting device, rather than a means by which to deter competitive bidding. Bidder fee provisions appear to be used to secure target wealth gains in deals with higher costs associated with negotiation and bid failure.","['Thomas W. Bates', 'Michael L.

"Allocations, adverse selection, and cascades in IPOs: Evidence from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange","We examine theories of IPO underpricing using unique data from Israel where the allocation to subscribers is by equal proration. This enables us to simulate the return earned by uninformed investors. Consistent with Rock's (1986) theory of adverse selection, allocations were negatively related to underpricing. But uninformed investors earned a negative allocation-weighted initial return, although the average initial return was 12%. They could break even, however, by using publicly available information. The data also supports Welch's (1992) theory of information cascades: demand is either extremely high or there is undersubscription, with very few cases in between.","['Yakov Amihud', 'Shmuel Hauser', 'Amir Kirsh']","['IPO', 'Underpricing', 'Uninformed subscribers', 'Proration']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002519,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,68,1,Yakov Amihud,2003,168.54069169881416
Control as a motivation for underpricing: a comparison of dual and single-class IPOs,"We find that dual-class firms experience less underpricing than single-class firms and explore several hypotheses which explain this phenomenon. Compared to single-class firms, dual-class companies have slightly higher post-IPO institutional ownership and experience fewer control events. Although dual-class firms achieve a lower underpricing cost, they trade at lower prices relative to earnings and sales than single-class IPOs. This pricing differential, combined with evidence that dual-class managers earn higher compensation and that dual-class shares are common among media and entertainment industry IPOs, suggests that dual-class ownership structures protect private control benefits.","['Scott B Smart', 'Chad J Zutter']","['Initial public offerings (IPO)', 'Underpricing', 'Dual class', 'Ownership structure', 'Governance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001090,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,69,1,Scott B Smart,2003,168.54069169881416
Founding family ownership and the agency cost of debt,"We investigate the impact of founding family ownership structure on the agency cost of debt. We find that founding family ownership is common in large, publicly traded firms and is related, both statistically and economically, to a lower cost of debt financing. Our results are consistent with the idea that founding family firms have incentive structures that result in fewer agency conflicts between equity and debt claimants. This suggests that bond holders view founding family ownership as an organizational structure that better protects their interests.","['Ronald C. Anderson', 'Sattar A. Mansi', 'David M.

We find that aggregate institutional ownership and the number of institutional investors decline in the year prior to forced CEO turnover. However, selling by institutions is far from universal. Overall, there is an increase in shareholdings of individual investors and a decrease in holdings of institutional investors who are more concerned with holding prudent securities, are better informed, or are engaged in momentum trading. Measures of institutional ownership changes are negatively related to the likelihoods of forced CEO turnover and that an executive from outside the firm is appointed CEO.","['Robert Parrino', 'Richard W Sias', 'Laura T Starks']","['Corporate governance', 'Institutional investors', 'CEO turnover']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002477,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.18733922890976942,68,1,Robert Parrino,2003,168.54069169881416

Concealing and confounding adverse signals: insider wealth-maximizing behavior in the IPO process,"We study a known negative signal, the sale of insider shares in an IPO and find that insiders adopt two concealment strategies consistent with wealth-maximizing behavior. First, insiders underreport the number of personally owned shares in the prominent original prospectus and use an obscure amendment to communicate the true higher level of shares to be offered. Second, when insiders increase shares in a later amendment, they tend to either increase secondary shares disproportional to primary share increases, or to reduce primary shares to wholly or partly conceal the increase in secondary shares offered. Insiders confound the negative secondary share signal by simultaneously sending a positive lockup signal.","['James S. Ang', 'James C.

Style investing,"We study asset prices in an economy where some investors categorize risky assets into different styles and move funds among these styles depending on their relative performance. In our economy, assets in the same style comove too much, assets in different styles comove too little, and reclassifying an asset into a new style raises its correlation with that style. We also predict that style returns exhibit a rich pattern of own- and cross-autocorrelations and that while asset-level momentum and value strategies are profitable, their style-level counterparts are even more so.

The problem is solved in closed form. Derivatives extend the risk and return tradeoffs associated with stochastic volatility and price jumps. As a means of exposure to volatility risk, derivatives enable non-myopic investors to exploit the time-varying opportunity set; and as a means of exposure to jump risk, they enable investors to disentangle the simultaneous exposure to diffusive and jump risks in the stock market.

Contrary to the pecking order theory, net equity issues track the financing deficit more closely than do net debt issues. While large firms exhibit some aspects of pecking order behavior, the evidence is not robust to the inclusion of conventional leverage factors, nor to the analysis of evidence from the 1990s.

Firms and their distressed banks: lessons from the Norwegian banking crisis,"We use the near-collapse of the Norwegian banking system during the period 1988–1991 to measure the impact of bank distress announcements on the stock prices of firms maintaining a relationship with a distressed bank. Although banks experienced large and permanent downward revisions in their equity value during the event period, firms maintaining relationships with these banks faced only small and temporary changes, on average, in stock price. Firms with access to unused liquid bank funds and firms that issued equity just prior to the crisis experience relatively high abnormal returns.

The personal-tax advantages of equity,"We value a firm that pays its cash flows to equity through share repurchases in a dynamic environment where personal taxes are paid on capital gains upon realization. The cost of capital is reduced by approximately 0.8% through the use of repurchases relative to dividends. We use the empirical distribution of pre-tax free cash flows in Fama and French (1999) to evaluate the tradeoffs between the costs of financial distress, the personal-tax advantages of equity, and the corporate-tax advantage to debt.

We trace these profits to practical limits on risk arbitrage. In our model of risk arbitrage, arbitrageurs’ risk-bearing capacity is constrained by deal completion risk and the size of the position they hold. Consistent with this model, we document that the returns to risk arbitrage increase in an ex ante measure of completion risk and target size. We also examine the influence of the general supply of arbitrage capital, measured by the total equity holdings of arbitrageurs, on arbitrage profits.","['Malcolm Baker', 'Serkan Savaşoglu']","['Arbitrage', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Market efficiency']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000727,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,64,1,Malcolm Baker,2002,168.45654756915923
"Asset liquidity, debt covenants, and managerial discretion in financial distress:","A hot growth stock in the 1980s, L.A. Gear's equity fell from $1 billion in market value in 1989 to zero in 1998. For over six years as revenues declined precipitously, management tried a series of radical strategy shifts while subsidizing the firm's large losses through working-capital liquidations. The L.A. Gear case illustrates that asset liquidity (broadly construed, not limited to excess cash) can give managers substantial operating discretion during financial distress. It also shows (1) that debt covenants can be stronger disciplinary mechanisms than requirements to meet cash interest payments, (2) why debt contracts typically constrain earnings instead of cash flow, (3) why cash balances are not equivalent to negative debt, and (4) why debt maturity matters. We find that many firms have highly liquid asset structures, thus their managers have the potential to subsidize losing operations should the need arise.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Karen H.

Who underreacts to cash-flow news? evidence from trading between individuals and institutions,"A large body of literature suggests that firm-level stock prices “underreact” to news about future cash flows; i.e., shocks to a firm's expected cash flows are positively correlated with shocks to expected returns on its stock. We examine the joint behavior of returns, cash-flow news, and trading between individuals and institutions. Institutions buy shares from (sell shares to) individuals in response to positive (negative) cash-flow news, thus exploiting the underreaction phenomenon. Institutions are not simply following price momentum strategies: When price goes up (down) in the absence of any cash-flow news, institutions sell shares to (buy shares from) individuals. Although institutions are trading in the “right” direction, institutions as a group outperform individuals by only 1.44% per annum before transaction and other costs, because they are extremely conservative in deviating from the value-weighted market index.","['Randolph B.

The impact of specialist firm acquisitions on market quality,"Acquisitions among New York Stock Exchange specialist firms can increase specialist firm size, capitalization, and market concentration, and thereby affect the market quality of the stocks they trade. We find that while traded stocks show significant improvement in several market quality measures following acquisitions, similar changes are evident in matched control stocks not involved in acquisitions. We conclude that specialist firm acquisitions either do not improve market quality, or improve market quality, but competitive and other pressures (resulting partly from the acquisitions themselves) force improvements in market quality for control stocks also. Either interpretation implies that specialist acquisitions have not had deleterious effects on market quality.","['Brian C. Hatch', 'Shane A.

Asymmetric correlations of equity portfolios,"Correlations between U.S. stocks and the aggregate U.S. market are much greater for downside moves, especially for extreme downside moves, than for upside moves. We develop a new statistic for measuring, comparing, and testing asymmetries in conditional correlations. Conditional on the downside, correlations in the data differ from the conditional correlations implied by a normal distribution by 11.6%. We find that conditional asymmetric correlations are fundamentally different from other measures of asymmetries, such as skewness and co-skewness. We find that small stocks, value stocks, and past loser stocks have more asymmetric movements. Controlling for size, we find that stocks with lower betas exhibit greater correlation asymmetries, and we find no relationship between leverage and correlation asymmetries. Correlation asymmetries in the data reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normal distributions at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies.

Corporate leverage and currency crises,"Currency crises can arise because it is optimal to bail out financially distressed exporting firms through a currency depreciation. Exporting firms will not undertake profitable investments when high leverage causes debt overhang problems. A currency depreciation increases the profitability of new investments when revenues are foreign-currency denominated and domestic-currency costs are nominally rigid. Ex ante, currency depreciation leads to excessive investment in risky projects even if safer, more valuable projects are available. However, currency depreciation is optimal ex ante if the risky projects have higher expected returns and if firms must rely on debt financing because of underdeveloped equity markets.","['Arturo Bris', 'Yrjö Koskinen']","['Currency depreciation', 'Debt overhang', 'Emerging markets', 'Efficient investment policy', 'Excessive risk taking']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000976,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,63,2,Arturo Bris,2002,168.45654756915923

We find that exogenous changes in diversity, due to changes in industry investment, are negatively related to firm value. Thus diversification destroys value, consistent with the inefficient internal capital markets hypothesis. Measurement error does not cause this finding.

Additionally, we show that certain “risk-premium adjusted” projections of changes in yields on the slope of the yield curve recover the coefficients of unity predicted by the models. Key to this matching are parameterizations of the market prices of risk that let the risk factors affect the market prices of risk directly, and not only through factor volatilities. The risk premiums have a simple form consistent with Fama's findings on the predictability of forward rates, and are also shown to be consistent with interest-rate feedback rules used by a monetary authority in setting monetary policy.","['Qiang Dai', 'Kenneth J.

Firm diversification and asymmetric information: evidence from analysts’ forecasts and earnings announcements,"Managers frequently cite the desire to mitigate asymmetric information as a motivation for increasing firm focus. The information benefits of focus appear relevant for the subset of firms that actually increase their focus; however, the relevance of focus-related information benefits for the population of diversified firms is an open question. This paper examines the relation between corporate diversification and asymmetric information proxies derived from analysts’ forecasts and abnormal returns associated with earnings announcements. I find that greater diversification is not associated with increased asymmetric information. These results call into question the notion that corporate diversification strictly exacerbates information problems.",['Shawn Thomas'],"['Transparency', 'Diversification', 'Focus', 'Asymmetric information', 'Corporate structure']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001290,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,64,3,Shawn Thomas,2002,168.45654756915923
"Strategic IPO underpricing, information momentum, and lockup expiration selling","Managers usually do not sell any of their own shares in an initial public offering but instead wait until the end of the lockup period. We develop a model in which managers strategically underprice IPOs to maximize personal wealth from selling shares at lockup expiration. First-day underpricing generates information momentum by attracting attention to the stock and thereby shifting the demand curve for the stock outwards. This allows managers to sell shares at the lockup expiration at prices higher than they would otherwise obtain. We test the model on a sample of IPOs in the 1990s. We find that higher ownership by managers is positively correlated with first-day underpricing, underpricing is positively correlated with research coverage, and research coverage is positively correlated with stock returns and insider selling at the lockup expiration. These results are consistent with the model.","['Rajesh K. Aggarwal', 'Laurie Krigman', 'Kent L.

Dating the integration of world equity markets,"Regulatory changes that appear comprehensive will have little impact on the functioning of a developing market if they fail to lead to foreign portfolio inflows. We specify a reduced-form model for a number of financial time series and search for a common, endogenous break in the data generating process. We also estimate a confidence interval for the break. Our endogenous break dates are accurately estimated but do not always correspond closely to dates of official capital market reforms. Indeed, the endogenous dates are usually later than official dates, highlighting the important distinction between market liberalization and market integration.","['Geert Bekaert', 'Campbell R.

Liquidity risk and specialness,"Repo contracts, the most important form of collateralized lending, are widely used by financial institutions and hedge funds to create short-selling positions and manage their leverage profile. Moreover, they have become the primary tool of money management and monetary control of several central banks, including the Bundesbank and the newly born European Central Bank. This paper is an empirical study of this market. More specifically, we study the extent to which the current term structure of long term “special” repo spreads discount the future collateral value (specialness) of Treasuries. We ask whether repo spreads embed a liquidity risk premium and whether such a risk premium is time-varying. We quantify the size of the average liquidity risk premium and we provide empirical evidence of the extent of its time-variation.","['Andrea Buraschi', 'Davide Menini']","['Liquidity risk', 'Treasury bonds', 'Repo contracts', 'Special repo rate', 'Expectation hypothesis', 'Treasury auctions']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000776,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,64,2,Andrea Buraschi,2002,168.45654756915923
A theory of strategic venture investing,"Some venture capital investors seek purely financial gains while others, such as corporations, also pursue strategic objectives. The paper examines a model where a strategic investor can achieve synergies, but can also face a conflict of interest with the entrepreneur. If the start-up is a complement to the strategic partner, it is optimal to obtain funding from the strategic investor. If the start-up is a mild substitute, the entrepreneur prefers an independent venture capitalist. With a strong substitute, syndication becomes optimal, such that the independent venture capitalist is the active lead investor and the strategic partner a passive co-investor. The expected returns for the entrepreneur are nonmonotonic, lowest for a mild substitute, and higher for a strong substitute as well as for a complement. The paper also explains why a strategic investor often pays a higher valuation than an independent venture capitalist.",['Thomas Hellmann'],"['Venture capital', 'Strategic investing', 'Contracts', 'Valuation']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000788,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,64,2,Thomas Hellmann,2002,168.45654756915923
Short-sale constraints and stock returns,"Stocks can be overpriced when short-sale constraints bind. We study the costs of short-selling equities from 1926 to 1933, using the publicly observable market for borrowing stock. Some stocks are sometimes expensive to short, and it appears that stocks enter the borrowing market when shorting demand is high. We find that stocks that are expensive to short or which enter the borrowing market have high valuations and low subsequent returns, consistent with the overpricing hypothesis. Size-adjusted returns are 1–2% lower per month for new entrants, and despite high costs it is profitable to short them.","['Charles M Jones', 'Owen A Lamont']","['Mispricing', 'Short-selling', 'Short-sale constraints', 'Securities lending']",[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002246,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,66,2,Charles M Jones,2002,168.45654756915923
Divestitures and the liquidity of the market for corporate assets,"The liquidity of the market for corporate assets plays an important role in explaining whether a firm divests a business segment, which segment the firm divests, and whether it divests a core segment or an unrelated segment. Firms are more likely to divest segments from industries with a more liquid market for corporate assets, unrelated segments, poorly performing segments, and small segments. Strikingly, the segment with the least liquid market is less likely to be divested than the best-performing segment, while the worst-performing segment is less likely to be divested than the segment with the most liquid market.","['Frederik P.

Growth opportunities and corporate debt policy: the case of the U.S. defense industry,"The U.S. defense industry provides a natural experiment for examining how changes in growth opportunities affect the level and structure of corporate debt. The growth opportunities of defense firms, compared with other firms, increased substantially during the Reagan defense buildup of the early 1980s but then declined significantly with the end of the cold war and associated defense budget cuts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We examine how the level and structure of corporate debt changed for a sample of 61 defense firms and a benchmark sample of 61 manufacturing firms during 1980–95, a period spanning the changes in growth opportunities. The debt levels of weapons manufacturers, which were most affected by the changes in growth opportunities, increased significantly as their growth opportunities declined. In addition, these firms lengthened the maturity structure of their debt, decreased the ratio of private to public debt, and decreased the use of senior debt as their growth opportunities declined. The results complement other studies that have found cross-sectional relations between proxies for growth opportunities and leverage variables and validate the prominent role played by growth opportunities in the theory of corporate finance.","['Vidhan K Goyal', 'Kenneth Lehn', 'Stanko Racic']","['Capital structure', 'Debt policy', 'Payout policy', 'Growth opportunities']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000703,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,64,1,Vidhan K Goyal,2002,168.45654756915923
Conditional performance measurement using portfolio weights: evidence for pension funds,"This paper combines the use of portfolio holdings data and conditioning information to create a new performance measure. Our conditional weight-based measure has several advantages. Using conditioning information avoids biases in weight-based measures as discussed by Grinblatt and Titman (J. Business 60 (1993)). When conditioning information is used, returns-based measures face a bias if managers can trade between observation dates. The new measures avoid this interim trading bias.

When a buyback isn’t a buyback: open market repurchases and employee options,"This paper examines how stock options affect the decision to repurchase shares. Firms announce repurchases when executives have large numbers of options outstanding and when employees have large numbers of options currently exercisable. Once the decision to repurchase is made, the amount repurchased is positively related to total options exercisable by all employees but independent of managerial options. These results are consistent with managers repurchasing both to maximize their own wealth and to fund employee stock option exercises. The market appears to recognize this motive, however, and reacts less positively to repurchases announced by firms with high levels of nonmanagerial options.",['Kathleen M Kahle'],"['Share repurchase', 'Executive stock options', 'Employee stock options']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000952,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,63,2,Kathleen M Kahle,2002,168.45654756915923
"Protection of minority shareholder interests, cross-listings in the United States, and subsequent equity offerings","This paper examines the hypothesis that non-US firms cross-list in the United States to increase protection of their minority shareholders. Cross-listing on the NYSE or Nasdaq subjects a non-US firm to a number of provisions of US securities law, and requires the firm to conform to US GAAP. It therefore increases the expected cost to managers of extracting private benefits, and commits the firm to protect minority shareholders’ interests. The expected relation between the quantity of cross-listings and shareholder protection in the home country is ambiguous, because managers will consider both expected private benefits and the public value of their shares. However, there are clear predictions about the relation between subsequent equity issues, shareholder protection, and cross-listings:(1)Equity issues increase following all cross-listings, regardless of shareholder protection.(2)The increase should be larger for cross-listings from countries with weak protection.(3)Equity issues following cross-listings in the US will tend to be in the US for firms from countries with strong protection and outside the US for firms from countries with weak protection.We find evidence consistent with each of these predictions. Overall, the desire to protect shareholder rights appears to be an important reason why some non-US firms cross-list in the United States.","['William A Reese', 'Michael S Weisbach']","['Cross-listings', 'Shareholder protection', 'Equity offerings', 'Legal systems']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001514,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,66,1,William A Reese,2002,168.45654756915923

"CEO compensation, diversification, and incentives","This paper examines the relation between chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) incentive levels and their firms’ risk characteristics. I show theoretically that, when CEOs cannot trade the market portfolio, optimal incentive level decreases with firm's nonsystematic risk but is ambiguously affected by firm's systematic risk; when CEOs can trade the market portfolio, optimal incentive level decreases with nonsystematic risk but is unaffected by systematic risk. Empirically I find support for these predictions. Furthermore, I find that incentives for CEOs likely facing binding short-selling constraints decrease with systematic as well as nonsystematic risk, as predicted by theory.

Depositor discipline and changing strategies for regulating thrift institutions,"This paper examines the role of uninsured deposits as a source of thrift funding from 1984 to 1994, and tests whether uninsured depositors have adjusted their holdings at thrifts in response to market forces, such as indications of impending institutional failure. It also examines how the reactions have changed over time as new legislation has been implemented. The study finds that failed institutions exhibit declining proportions of uninsured deposits-to-total-deposits prior to failure and that failing institutions attract fewer deposits from uninsured depositors prior to failure than do solvent institutions. Though there are some differences between the periods, the empirical results indicate that uninsured deposits will be governed by market discipline and that reducing the insurance limits on deposits will increase market discipline on thrifts.","['Lawrence G Goldberg', 'Sylvia C Hudgins']","['Depositor discipline', 'Uninsured deposits', 'Thrifts', 'Regulation']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000964,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,63,2,Lawrence G Goldberg,2002,168.45654756915923
Agents watching agents?: evidence from pension fund ownership and firm value,"This paper examines the valuation effects associated with the incentive structures of different types of institutional investors using the ownership levels of public and private pension funds in a firm. The results suggest that institutional monitoring is associated with valuation effects when both observable and unobservable aspects of the relationship between institutions and firms are taken into account. Moreover, the valuation effects vary according to the objective functions of institutions’ administrators. Thus, other shareholders do not necessarily benefit from relationships between institutions and managers, and they could be hurt when the institutional agents watching firm agents have conflicts of interest with other shareholders.",['Tracie Woidtke'],"['Agency theory', 'Institutional investors', 'Corporate governance', 'Ownership structure']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000915,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,63,1,Tracie Woidtke,2002,168.45654756915923
Do after-tax returns affect mutual fund inflows?,"This paper explores the relationship between the after-tax returns that taxable investors earn on equity mutual funds and the subsequent cash inflows to these funds. Previous studies have documented that funds with high pretax returns attract greater inflows. This paper presents evidence, based on a large sample of retail equity mutual funds over the period 1993–1999, that after-tax returns have more explanatory power than pretax returns in explaining inflows. In addition, funds with large overhangs of unrealized capital gains experience smaller inflows, all else equal, than funds without such unrealized gains. A large capital gain overhang discourages both gross fund inflows and gross outflows, but the inflow effect dominates the outflow effect.","['Daniel Bergstresser', 'James Poterba']","['Mutual funds', 'Income taxation', 'Taxes and portfolio choice', 'After-tax returns']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000661,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,63,3,Daniel Bergstresser,2002,168.45654756915923
Empirical pricing kernels,"This paper investigates the empirical characteristics of investor risk aversion over equity return states by estimating a time-varying pricing kernel, which we call the empirical pricing kernel (EPK). We estimate the EPK on a monthly basis from 1991 to 1995, using S&P 500 index option data and a stochastic volatility model for the S&P 500 return process. We find that the EPK exhibits counter cyclical risk aversion over S&P 500 return states. We also find that hedging performance is significantly improved when we use hedge ratios based the EPK rather than a time-invariant pricing kernel.","['Joshua V. Rosenberg', 'Robert F.

Pricing and capital allocation in catastrophe insurance,"This paper studies multi-line pricing and capital allocation by insurance companies when solvency matters to consumers, capital is costly to hold, and the average loss is uncertain. In this environment, product quality concerns lead firms to diversify across markets and charge high prices for risk that threatens company solvency, even if the risk is unrelated to other asset risk. Price differences across markets are traced to differences in capital required at the margin to maintain solvency. Finally, the paper shows that capital costs have significant effects on catastrophe insurance markets because of high marginal capital requirements.",['George Zanjani'],"['Insurance', 'Insurance companies', 'Capital allocation']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001411,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,65,2,George Zanjani,2002,168.45654756915923
Governance with poor investor protection: evidence from top executive turnover in Italy,"This paper studies the determinants of executive turnover and firm valuation as a function of ownership and control structure in Italy, a country that features low legal protection for investors, firms with controlling shareholders, and pyramidal groups.

"Order imbalance, liquidity, and market returns","Traditionally, volume has provided the link between trading activity and returns. We focus on a hitherto unexplored but intuitive measure of trading activity: the aggregate daily order imbalance, buy orders less sell orders, on the New York Stock Exchange. Order imbalance increases following market declines and vice versa, which reveals that investors are contrarians on aggregate. Order imbalances in either direction, excess buy or sell orders, reduce liquidity. Market-wide returns are strongly affected by contemporaneous and lagged order imbalances.

Synchronization risk and delayed arbitrage,We argue that arbitrage is limited if rational traders face uncertainty about when their peers will exploit a common arbitrage opportunity. This synchronization risk—which is distinct from noise trader risk and fundamental risk—arises in our model because arbitrageurs become sequentially aware of mispricing and they incur holding costs. We show that rational arbitrageurs “time the market” rather than correct mispricing right away. This leads to delayed arbitrage. The analysis suggests that behavioral influences on prices are resistant to arbitrage in the short and intermediate run.,"['Dilip Abreu', 'Markus K Brunnermeier']","['Limits to arbitrage', 'Synchronization risk', 'Market timing', 'Efficient markets hypothesis', 'Behavioral finance']",[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002271,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,66,2,Dilip Abreu,2002,168.45654756915923

By including both benchmark and nonbenchmark indexes, we distinguish pricing-model inaccuracy from managerial skill.

Investing in active mutual funds can be optimal even for investors who believe managers cannot outperform passive indexes.

Breadth of ownership and stock returns,"We develop a stock market model with differences of opinion and short-sales constraints. When breadth is low—i.e., when few investors have long positions—this signals that the short-sales constraint is binding tightly, and that prices are high relative to fundamentals. Thus reductions in breadth should forecast lower returns. Using data on mutual fund holdings, we find that stocks whose change in breadth in the prior quarter is in the lowest decile of the sample underperform those in the top decile by 6.38% in the twelve months after formation. Adjusting for size, book-to-market, and momentum, the figure is 4.95%.","['Joseph Chen', 'Harrison Hong', 'Jeremy C.

Execution times are very sensitive to the limit price, but are not sensitive to limit size.

IPO allocations: discriminatory or discretionary?,"We estimate the structural links between IPO allocations, pre-market information production, and initial underpricing and find that (1) allocation policies favor institutional investors, both in the US and worldwide; (2) increasing institutional allocations results in offer prices that deviate more from the pre-marketing price range; (3) constraints on bankers’ discretion reduce institutional allocations and result in smaller price revisions, indicating diminished information production; and (4) initial returns are directly related to information production and inversely related to institutional allocations. Our results indicate that discretionary allocations promote price discovery in the IPO market and reduce indirect issuance costs for IPO firms.","['Alexander P Ljungqvist', 'William J Wilhelm']","['Initial public offerings', 'Bookbuilding', 'Underpricing', 'Intermediation', 'Allocation policy']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001381,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,65,2,Alexander P Ljungqvist,2002,168.45654756915923
Performance consequences of mandatory increases in executive stock ownership,"We examine a sample of firms that adopt “target ownership plans”, under which managers are required to own a minimum amount of stock. We find that prior to plan adoption, such firms exhibit low managerial equity ownership and low stock price performance. Managerial equity ownership increases significantly in the two years following plan adoption. We also observe that excess accounting returns and stock returns are higher after the plan is adopted. Thus, for our sample of firms, the required increases in the level of managerial equity ownership result in improvements in firm performance.","['John E. Core', 'David F.

The dilution impact of daily fund flows on open-end mutual funds,"We examine how mutual fund flows that are correlated with subsequent fund returns can have a dilution impact on the performance of open-end funds. Active trading of open-end funds has a meaningful economic impact on the returns of passive, nontrading shareholders, particularly in U.S.-based international funds. The overall sample of domestic equity funds shows no dilution impact, but we find an annualized negative impact of 0.48% in international funds (and nearly 1% for a subsample of funds whose daily flows are particularly large). The exchange and pricing policies of mutual funds can thus have important performance-related implications.","['Jason T Greene', 'Charles W Hodges']","['Mutual funds', 'Flows', 'Daily fund flows']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0200137X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,65,1,Jason T Greene,2002,168.45654756915923
Liquidity provision and specialist trading in NYSE-listed non-U.S. stocks,"We examine how the intrinsic differences between U.S. and non-U.S. stocks affect market participants and the market quality of non-U.S. stocks relative to U.S. stocks. Using proprietary data on NYSE specialist trading, we find that, all else equal, specialist closing inventory positions for non-U.S. stocks are closer to zero than U.S. stocks. The evidence on specialist participation and stabilization rates is mixed. Non-U.S. stocks from developed markets have higher specialist participation and stabilization rates than U.S. stocks, while emerging market stocks have lower participation and stabilization rates than U.S. stocks. With respect to market quality, we find that, all else equal, non-U.S. stocks have wider spreads, less depth, and greater transitory volatility than U.S. stocks. We investigate the reasons behind the difference in liquidity and find that the larger non-U.S. spreads are primarily due to higher information asymmetry and increased adverse selection risk. We conclude that liquidity providers demand greater compensation for trading non-U.S. stocks, but this additional compensation is necessary to offset the higher adverse selection risk.","['Jeffrey M.

Building the IPO order book: underpricing and participation limits with costly information,"We examine the book-building method for marketing IPOs. In our model, the underwriter selects a group of investors along with a pricing and allocation mechanism to maximize (at minimum cost) the information generated during the process of going public. We also address the moral hazard problem faced by investors when evaluation is costly. When there is little need for accurate pricing, the expected gain from underpricing exactly offsets the investors’ costs of acquiring information. When pricing accuracy is important, however, the number of investors participating in the offering is larger, underpricing is greater, and investors can earn economic rents.","['Ann E.

Litigation risk and IPO underpricing,"We examine the relation between risk and IPO underpricing and test two aspects of the litigation-risk hypothesis: (1) firms with higher litigation risk underprice their IPOs by a greater amount as a form of insurance (insurance effect) and (2) higher underpricing lowers expected litigation costs (deterrence effect). To adjust for the endogeneity bias in previous studies, we use a simultaneous equation framework.

Using firm-level data for 40 countries, we compute the proportion of firms in each country relying on external finance and examine how that proportion differs across financial systems. We find that the development of a country's legal system predicts access to external finance, and stock markets and the banking system affect access to external finance differently. However, we find no evidence that firms’ access to external financing is predicted by several proxies for relative development of stock markets to the development of the banking system.","['Aslı Demirgüç-Kunt', 'Vojislav Maksimovic']","['Financial system', 'Firm growth', 'Law', 'Financial institutions']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001459,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,65,3,Aslı Demirgüç-Kunt,2002,168.45654756915923
"Securities lending, shorting, and pricing","We present a model of asset valuation in which short-selling requires searching for security lenders and bargaining over the lending fee. If lendable securities are difficult to locate, then the price of the security is initially elevated, and expected to decline. This price decline is to be anticipated, for example, after an initial public offering, and is increasing in the degree of heterogeneity of beliefs about the future value of the security. The prospect of lending fees may push the initial price of a security above even the most optimistic buyer's valuation of the security's future dividends. A higher price can thus be obtained with some shorting than if shorting is disallowed.","['Darrell Duffie', 'Nicolae Gârleanu', 'Lasse Heje Pedersen']","['Shorting', 'Lending fee', 'Pricing', 'Differences of opinion']",[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0200226X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,66,2,Darrell Duffie,2002,168.45654756915923

Equilibrium and welfare in markets with financially constrained arbitrageurs,"We propose a multiperiod model in which competitive arbitrageurs exploit discrepancies between the prices of two identical risky assets traded in segmented markets. Arbitrageurs need to collateralize separately their positions in each asset, and this implies a financial constraint limiting positions as a function of wealth. In our model, arbitrage activity benefits all investors because arbitrageurs supply liquidity to the market. However, arbitrageurs might fail to take a socially optimal level of risk, in the sense that a change in their positions can make all investors better off. We characterize conditions under which arbitrageurs take too much or too little risk.","['Denis Gromb', 'Dimitri Vayanos']",[],[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002283,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.2714975135197367,66,2,Denis Gromb,2002,168.45654756915923

We find that term and market premia are robust predictors. Moreover, small-cap value stocks appear more predictable than large-cap growth stocks. We also investigate the implications of model uncertainty from investment management perspectives.

Stocks are special too: an analysis of the equity lending market,"With a year of equity loans by a major lender, we measure the effect of actual short-selling costs and constraints on trading strategies that involve short-selling. We find the loans of initial public offering (IPOs), DotCom, large-cap, growth and low-momentum stocks to be cheap relative to the strategies’ documented profits and that investors who can short only stocks that are cheap and easy to borrow can enjoy at least some of the profits of unconstrained investors. Most IPOs are loaned on their first settlement days and throughout their first months, and the underperformance around lockup expiration is significant even for the IPOs that are cheap and easy to borrow. The effect of short-selling frictions appears strongest in merger arbitrage. Acquirers’ stock is expensive to borrow, especially when the acquirer is small, though the major influence on trading profits is not through expense but availability.","['Christopher C.

The option to withdraw IPOs during the premarket: empirical analysis,"American IPOs are priced after a process of bookbuilding, during which issuers can withdraw at any time. We hypothesize that the option to withdraw reduces underpricing by strengthening the issuers’ bargaining power with respect to investors. Empirical analysis reveals that underpricing is lower when investor perception of an IPO's likelihood of withdrawal is higher. Withdrawing issuers are neither smaller nor less profitable than issuers completing their IPOs, and engage underwriters that are as reputable as those managing completed offerings. Withdrawal is correlated with leverage, intended use of proceeds, expected issue size, venture backing, revenues, NASDAQ returns, and IPO activity.","['Walid Y. Busaba', 'Lawrence M.

The information content of litigation participation securities: the case of CalFed Bancorp,"CalFed Bancorp is one of 126 S&Ls suing the U.S. government for breach of contract related to supervisory goodwill, a form of goodwill created by the acquisition of insolvent thrifts during the early 1980s. Before a determination of damages in its lawsuit, CalFed announced and issued a litigation participation security giving shareholders a proportional claim on recovered damages, if any. This announcement generated a positive excess return in part because it made CalFed a more likely acquisition target. Trading in the security also reveals important, yet previously unavailable, information about CalFed's lawsuit: its price reveals a market-based estimate of damages while its beta reveals information regarding expected returns and trial duration. In a broader context, this paper identifies acquisition facilitation as a benefit of issuing targeted stock and highlights a series of lawsuits that will set important precedents regarding the determination of liability and the estimation of damages in breach of contract cases.",['Benjamin C.

Further, we find that firms reprice in response to poor firm-specific, not poor industry, performance. However, we find no evidence that repricing is related to agency problems.

Locking out rival bidders: The use of lockup options in corporate mergers,"Conventional wisdom suggests that lockup options are granted by self-interested target managers to discourage competition and hand-select an acquirer, thus harming target shareholder wealth. Evidence from 2,067 deals announced during 1988–1995 suggests that lockup options inhibit competition, but on average, deals with lockup options have higher target announcement and overall returns and lower bidder announcement returns, even after controlling for shareholder anticipation and other factors. An examination of 100 merger proxies suggests lockup options are no more prevalent in privately negotiated, preemptive deals, and average target returns are higher when such deals include a lockup option. The overall evidence is more consistent with managers using lockup options to enhance bargaining power than with lockup options harming shareholder wealth.",['Timothy R Burch'],"['Lockup option', 'Merger', 'Takeover', 'Bidder discrimination']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000411,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,60,1,Timothy R Burch,2001,168.3724034395043

Motivated by this observation, we analyze the relation between expected equity returns and the level as well as the volatility of trading activity, a proxy for liquidity. We document a result contrary to our initial hypothesis, namely, a negative and surprisingly strong cross-sectional relationship between stock returns and the variability of dollar trading volume and share turnover, after controlling for size, book-to-market ratio, momentum, and the level of dollar volume or share turnover. This effect survives a number of robustness checks, and is statistically and economically significant.

I show that managerial ownership, while substantially different across firms, typically changes slowly from year to year within a company. With rational managers maximising long-term utility, small, one-year changes in ownership are not likely to reflect notable changes in incentives that would lead to substantive within-year changes in performance.

Commonality in the order flows explains roughly two-thirds of the commonality in returns. Second, we examine variation and common covariation in various liquidity proxies and market depth (trade impact) coefficients. Liquidity proxies such as the bid–ask spread and bid–ask quote sizes help explain time variation in trade impacts.

Convergence trading with wealth effects: an amplification mechanism in financial markets,"I study convergence traders with logarithmic utility in a continuous-time equilibrium model. In general, convergence traders reduce asset price volatility and provide liquidity by taking risky positions against noise trading. However, when an unfavorable shock causes them to suffer capital losses, thus eroding their risk-bearing capacity, they liquidate their positions, thereby amplifying the original shock. In extreme circumstances, this wealth effect causes convergence traders to be destabilizing in that they trade in exactly the same direction as noise traders.

Pay for performance? Government regulation and the structure of compensation contracts,"In 1992–1993, the SEC required enhanced disclosure on executive compensation and Congress enacted tax legislation limiting the deductibility of non-performance related compensation over one million dollars, i.e. Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). We examine the effects of these regulatory changes and report small and large sample evidence that many million-dollar firms have reduced salaries in response to 162(m) and that salary growth rates have declined post-1993 for the firms most likely to be affected by the regulations. We further document that bonus and total compensation payouts are increasingly sensitive to stock returns after 1993, especially for firms with million-dollar pay packages. We also document that, once we control for other factors affecting CEO incentives, the sensitivity of the CEO's wealth to changes in shareholder wealth has increased from 1993 to 1996 for firms with CEOs near or above the million dollar compensation level. Overall, our results suggest that some firms have reduced salaries in response to 162(m).

Credit enhancement through financial engineering: Freeport McMoRan's gold-denominated depositary shares,"In 1993 and 1994, FreeportMcMoRan Copper and Gold issued two series of gold-denominated depositary shares to finance the expansion of its mining capacity in Indonesia. The pricing of these securities reflected their enhanced credit quality, which arose from the positive correlation between the value of the firm and the value of the securities. This feature of the securities effectively bundles a gold hedge with financing. A bundled hedge avoids wealth transfers to senior bondholders, since junior bondholders can effectively net their bond-related claims on the firm against their hedge-related liability to the firm. Such securities cannot be replicated by conventional hedging strategies, and they also mitigate the asset substitution problem.","['N.K Chidambaran', 'Chitru S Fernando', 'Paul A Spindt']","['Risk management', 'Credit enhancement', 'Gold-linked', 'Hybrid securities']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000514,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,60,2,N.K Chidambaran,2001,168.3724034395043
Sixteenths: direct evidence on institutional execution costs,"In June 1997, the New York Stock Exchange lowered its minimum price increment on most stocks from eighths to sixteenths. We use a sample of institutional trades to directly measure the effect of this tick size reduction on execution costs. Though quoted and effective spreads decline, realized execution costs for these institutions increase after the change to sixteenths. Costs increase most for orders that aggressively demand liquidity, including large orders, orders placed by momentum traders, and orders not worked by the trading desk. These findings emphasize that spreads are not a sufficient statistic for market quality. Smaller tick sizes may actually reduce market liquidity.","['Charles M Jones', 'Marc L Lipson']","['Minimum tick', 'Decimalization', 'Implementation costs', 'Transaction costs']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000878,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,2,Charles M Jones,2001,168.3724034395043
Why do firms switch underwriters?,"In the mid-1990s, 30% of firms completing an SEO within three years of their IPO switched lead underwriter. This article provides evidence on why they switched. Contrary to predictions of prior research, there is little evidence that firms switch due to dissatisfaction with underwriter performance at the time of the IPO. A surprising result is that switchers’ IPOs were significantly less underpriced than non-switchers’ IPOs. However, switchers raised fewer proceeds than expected, compared to the mid-point of the filing range, while non-switchers raised significantly more proceeds. There are two main reasons for switching. Firms graduate to higher reputation underwriters, and they strategically buy additional and influential analyst coverage from the new lead underwriter. Survey results support these conclusions.","['Laurie Krigman', 'Wayne H Shaw', 'Kent L Womack']","['Underwriter services', 'Underpricing', 'Sell-side research', 'Reputation', 'All-star analysts']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000459,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,60,2,Laurie Krigman,2001,168.3724034395043
"Direct foreign ownership, institutional investors, and firm characteristics","In this paper, we characterize foreign ownership using a dataset of ownership and attributes of Swedish firms. The analysis reveals that foreigners show a preference for large firms, firms paying low dividends, and firms with large cash positions on their balance sheets. When we further analyze the preference for large firms, we find that market liquidity and presence in international markets, measured through export sales or listings on other exchanges, seem to characterize foreign holdings better than firm size alone. Foreigners also tend to underweight firms with a dominant owner. Importantly, we demonstrate that most of the features associated with foreign ownership are driven by the fact that foreign investors typically are mutual funds or other institutional investors. Hence, we identify an institutional investor bias rather than a foreign investor bias. Finally, using ownership data on a country level, we conclude that the results are particularly strong among U.S. investors, who comprise the largest institutions among foreign investors.","['Magnus Dahlquist', 'Göran Robertsson']","['Individual investors', 'Home bias', 'Market portfolio', 'Mutual funds']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000921,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,3,Magnus Dahlquist,2001,168.3724034395043
Discretionary reductions in warrant exercise prices,"Managers can decide to reduce a warrant's exercise price. A reduction in exercise price can induce exercise (a conversion-forcing reduction) or not (a long-term reduction). Conversion-forcing firms show an abnormal return of −1.53% on the announcement day but they perform well over the three years following the announcement. This finding suggests that the funds raised from warrant exercise are invested in profitable projects. Long-term reductions show an abnormal return of −1.15% on the announcement day. These firms also perform well following the reduction, which suggests that the lower exercise price restores managerial incentives.","['John S.

Pricing the strategic value of putable securities in liquidity crises,"Putable security holders have a de facto first claim on the firm's liquid assets and can threaten to force solvent issuers to bear financial distress costs. Their threatening power implies that the puts have a strategic value larger than their intrinsic value. Strategic value depends on the issuer's size, potential distress costs, and the distribution of put ownership relative to the firm's liquidity position. The analysis of Kmart's put-induced crisis in 1995, and a calibration to observed secondary market yield reductions on poison put bonds, shows that strategic value is an important determinant of payouts received by bondholders.",['Alexander David'],"['Credit risk protection', 'Poison puts', 'Liquidity trigger', 'Bankruptcy costs', 'Multilateral negotiations']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000829,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,1,Alexander David,2001,168.3724034395043
CEO compensation and bank mergers,"Recent bank mergers generally did not improve relative operating performance or produce positive abnormal returns to acquiring bank shareholders. We examine the relationship between mergers and CEO compensation during 1986–1995, a period marked by overcapacity and frequent mergers. We find that mergers have a net positive effect on compensation, mainly via the effect of size on compensation. Compensation generally increases even if mergers cause the acquiring bank's stock price to decline, as is typical after a merger announcement. The form of compensation affects merger decisions, since CEOs with more stock-based compensation were less likely to make an acquisition.","['Richard T Bliss', 'Richard J Rosen']","['Banking', 'Mergers', 'Compensation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000575,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,61,1,Richard T Bliss,2001,168.3724034395043
Do investment banks compete in IPOs?: the advent of the “7% plus contract”,"The large number of initial public offerings (IPOs) with a 7% spread suggests either that investment bankers collude to profit from 7% IPOs or that the 7% contract is an efficient innovation that better suits the IPO. My tests do not support the collusion theory. Low concentration and ease of entry characterize the IPO market. Moreover, the 7% spread is not abnormally profitable, nor has its use been diminished by public awareness of collusion allegations.

Disappearing dividends: changing firm characteristics or lower propensity to pay?,"The proportion of firms paying cash dividends falls from 66.5% in 1978 to 20.8% in 1999, due in part to the changing characteristics of publicly traded firms. Fed by new listings, the population of publicly traded firms tilts increasingly toward small firms with low profitability and strong growth opportunities – characteristics typical of firms that have never paid dividends. More interesting, we also show that regardless of their characteristics, firms have become less likely to pay dividends. This lower propensity to pay is at least as important as changing characteristics in the declining incidence of dividend-paying firms.","['Eugene F Fama', 'Kenneth R French']","['Dividends', 'Payout policy', 'Stock repurchases', 'New listings']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000381,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,60,1,Eugene F Fama,2001,168.3724034395043

The capital gain lock-in effect and long-horizon return reversal,This paper develops and tests an asset pricing model that allows for the presence of a capital gain lock-in effect. The principal empirical implication of this model is that stock returns exhibit reversal behavior over long horizons because of investors’ accrued capital gains. Empirical tests on the cross-section of stock returns find that long-horizon return reversal is primarily attributable to the effect of investors’ accrued capital gains and that the effect is nonlinear in the manner predicted by the model. These finds are robust to the addition of size and past total return to the empirical tests.,['Peter Klein'],"['Capital gains taxation', 'Lock-in effect', 'General equilibrium', 'Return reversal']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000817,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,1,Peter Klein,2001,168.3724034395043

Further, we find that performance rankings based on forecast timeliness are more informative than rankings based on abnormal trading volume and forecast accuracy. We also present evidence that analyst's forecast revisions are correlated with recent stock price performance, suggesting that security analysts use publicly available information to revise their earnings forecasts.","['Rick A.

We allow the parameters of each model's pricing kernel to fluctuate with the business cycle. While we cannot reject correct pricing for Campbell's (J.

Portfolio choice and equity characteristics: characterizing the hedging demands induced by return predictability,"This paper examines portfolio allocation across equity portfolios formed on the basis of characteristics like size and book-to-market. In particular, the paper assesses the impact of return predictability on portfolio choice for a multi-period investor with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 4. Compared to the investor's allocation in her last period, return predictability with dividend yield causes the investor early in life to tilt her risky-asset portfolio away from high book-to-market stocks and away from small stocks. These results are explained using Merton's (Econometrica 41 (1973) 867) characterization of portfolio allocation by a multi-period investor in a continuous time setting. Abnormal returns relative to the investor's optimal early life portfolio are also calculated. These abnormal returns are found to exhibit the same cross-sectional patterns as abnormal returns calculated relative to the market portfolio: higher for small rather than large firms, and higher for high rather than low book-to-market firms. Thus, hedging demand may be a partial explanation for the high expected returns documented for small firms and high book-to-market firms. However, even with this hedging demand, the investor wants to sell short the low book-to market portfolio to hold the high book-to-market portfolio. The utility costs of using a value-weighted equity index or of ignoring predictability are also calculated. An investor using a value-weighted equity index would give up a much larger fraction of her wealth to have access to book-to-market portfolio than size portfolios. Finally, an investor would give up a much larger fraction of her wealth to have access to dividend yield information than term spread information.",['Anthony W Lynch'],"['Portfolio choice', 'Return predictability', 'Multiple risky assets', 'Hedging demands']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000745,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,62,1,Anthony W Lynch,2001,168.3724034395043
The market for catastrophe risk: a clinical examination,"This paper examines the market for catastrophe event risk – i.e., financial claims that are linked to losses associated with natural hazards, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Risk management theory suggests protection by insurers and other corporations against the largest cat events is most valuable. However, most insurers purchase relatively little cat reinsurance against large events, and premiums are high relative to expected losses. To understand why the theory fails, we examine transactions that look to capital markets, rather than traditional reinsurance markets, for risk-bearing capacity.

The structure of debt and active equity investors: The case of the buyout specialist,"This paper examines the role buyout specialists play in structuring the debt used to finance the LBO and in monitoring management in the post-LBO firm. We find that when buyout specialists control the majority of the post-LBO equity, the LBO transaction is likely to be financed with less short-term and/or senior debt and less likely to experience financial distress. We also find that buyout specialists have greater board representation on smaller boards, suggesting that they actively monitor managers, and that for these transactions, using debt with tighter terms does not significantly increase the firm's performance. In contrast, in all other transactions using such debt does significantly increase the firm's performance. These findings suggest that active monitoring by a buyout specialist substitutes for tighter debt terms in monitoring and motivating managers of LBOs.","['James F Cotter', 'Sarah W Peck']","['Leveraged buyouts', 'Buyout specialists', 'Active investors', 'Financial distress', 'Debt structure']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000830,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,1,James F Cotter,2001,168.3724034395043
The portfolio flows of international investors,"This paper explores daily international portfolio flows into and out of 44 countries from 1994 through 1998. We find several facts concerning the behavior of flows and their relationship with equity returns. First, we detect regional flow factors that have increased in importance through time. Second, the flows appear to be stationary, but far more persistent than returns. Third, flows are strongly influenced by past returns, a finding consistent with positive feedback trading by international investors. Fourth, inflows have positive forecasting power for future equity returns, and this power is statistically significant in emerging markets. Fifth, the sensitivity of local stock prices to foreign inflows is positive and large. Sixth, prices seem consistent with flow persistence, in that transitory inflows impact future returns negatively.","['Kenneth A. Froot', 'Paul G.J. O’Connell', 'Mark S.

Factor dependence of Bermudan swaptions: fact or fiction?,"This paper investigates the effect of interest rate correlation in pricing and exercise of Bermudan swaptions.

We explain the rationale behind these results, and also demonstrate that exercise information generated within a best-fit one-factor model only leads to insignificant losses when properly applied in a two-factor model. Our results provide support for the standard Wall Street practice of using continuously re-calibrated one-factor models to price Bermudan swaptions, as long as calibration procedures are sufficiently comprehensive.","['Leif Andersen', 'Jesper Andreasen']","['Bermudan swaptions', 'Multi-factor gaussian models', 'Multi-factor libor market models', 'Model calibration']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000721,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,62,1,Leif Andersen,2001,168.3724034395043

Our clinical analysis provides support for the explanatory power of our model. Calibrating the predictions of the model with data from these STACs, we demonstrate a correspondence between theory and actual corporate behavior.

The new method is simple to use and requires no assumptions stronger than those made by Connor and Korajczyk. It is demonstrated through simulations and analysis of actual stock market data that allowing heteroskedasticity sometimes improves the quality of the extracted factors quite dramatically. Over the period from 1989 to 1993, for example, a single factor extracted using the Connor and Korajczyk method explains only 8.2% of the variation of the CRSP value-weighted index, while the factor extracted allowing heteroskedasticity explains 57.3%.

Throwing away a billion dollars: the cost of suboptimal exercise strategies in the swaptions market,"This paper studies the costs of applying single-factor exercise strategies to American swap options when the term structure is actually driven by multiple factors.

Based on estimates of notional amounts outstanding, the total present value costs of following single-factor strategies could be several billion dollars. These results illustrate the importance of using well-specified term structure models.","['Francis A Longstaff', 'Pedro Santa-Clara', 'Eduardo S Schwartz']","['American option', 'Exercise strategy', 'Term structure', 'Model misspecification']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000733,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,62,1,Francis A Longstaff,2001,168.3724034395043
Exchange rate exposure and competition: evidence from the automotive industry,"This study examines the effect of real exchange rate changes on multinational firms and incorporates the effect of intra-industry competition on the relation between exchange rates and firm value. To test the relation more effectively, tests are conducted using a sample of automotive firms from the United States and Japan. Consistent with theoretical predictions, there is significant exposure to exchange rate shocks. Moreover, there is evidence of time-variation in exchange rate exposure, which is consistent with changes in the competitive environment within the industry. Finally, evidence is presented that is consistent with foreign sales being a major determinant of exposure and the effectiveness of operational hedging through foreign production.",['Rohan Williamson'],"['Exchange rate exposure', 'Risk management', 'Currency exposure', 'International corporate finance']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000933,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,3,Rohan Williamson,2001,168.3724034395043
Managing foreign exchange risk with derivatives,"This study investigates the foreign exchange risk management program of HDG Inc. (pseudonym), a US-based manufacturer of durable equipment. Precise examination of factors affecting why and how the firm manages its foreign exchange exposure are explored through the use of internal firm documents, discussions with managers, and data on3,110 foreign-exchange derivative transactions. Informational asymmetries, facilitation of internal contracting, and competitive pricing concerns appear to motivate why the firm hedges. How HDG hedges depends on accounting treatment, derivative market liquidity, exchange rate volatility, exposure volatility, and recent hedging outcomes.",['Gregory W Brown'],"['Derivative securities', 'Hedging', 'Corporate risk management']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000496,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,60,2,Gregory W Brown,2001,168.3724034395043
Where do merger gains come from? Bank mergers from the perspective of insiders and outsiders,"Traditional studies fail to find conclusive evidence that bank mergers create value. We analyze a sample of the largest bank mergers between 1985 and 1996. For a subset of this sample, we obtain management estimates of projected cost savings and revenue enhancements. We find that recent mergers appear to result in positive revaluations of the combined value of bidder and target stocks. Although not as large as the present value of management's estimates, with the bulk of the revaluation being attributable to estimated cost savings rather than projected revenue enhancements.","['Joel F Houston', 'Christopher M James', 'Michael D Ryngaert']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Bank mergers']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000460,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,60,2,Joel F Houston,2001,168.3724034395043
Do the individuals closest to internet firms believe they are overvalued,"Two explanations are commonly offered for the large number of recent IPOs by Internet firms. The first argues that Internet firms are trying to grab market share in an industry with large economies of scale. The second argues that Internet firms are rushing to go public when Internet stock prices are irrationally high. In this paper we examine the actions of those closest to Internet firms – firm managers, underwriters, and venture capitalists – to determine their motives for going public. Numerous strategic alliances and mergers and acquisitions provide strong evidence of a rush to grab market share. Other factors provide only weak evidence that Internet IPOs are attempts to sell overpriced stock.","['Paul Schultz', 'Mir Zaman']","['Internet', 'IPO', 'Mergers', 'Market efficiency']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000908,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,3,Paul Schultz,2001,168.3724034395043
Stealth-trading: Which traders’ trades move stock prices?,Using audit trail data for a sample of NYSE firms we show that medium-size trades are associated with a disproportionately large cumulative stock price change relative to their proportion of all trades and volume. This result is consistent with the predictions of Barclay and Warner's (1993) stealth-trading hypothesis. We find that the source of this disproportionately large cumulative price impact of medium-size trades is trades initiated by institutions. This result is robust to various sensitivity checks. Our findings appear to confirm street lore that institutions are informed traders.,['Sugato Chakravarty'],"['Stealth-trading', 'Price impact', 'Institutions', 'Individuals', 'Microstructure']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000630,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,61,2,Sugato Chakravarty,2001,168.3724034395043
The duration of bank relationships,"We analyze the duration of bank relationships using a unique panel data set of listed firms and their banks from the bank-dominated Norwegian market. We find that firms are more likely to leave a bank as the relationship matures. Small, profitable, and highly leveraged firms maintain shorter bank relationships, as do firms with multiple bank relationships. These findings are robust to censoring, alternate specifications for the distribution of relationship duration, and other control variables relevant to the Norwegian market. Overall, our results cast doubt on theories suggesting that firms become locked into bank relationships.","['Steven Ongena', 'David C Smith']","['bank relationships', 'hazard models', 'duration analysis']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000691,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,61,3,Steven Ongena,2001,168.3724034395043
Capital budgeting and compensation with asymmetric information and moral hazard,"We consider optimal capital allocation and managerial compensation mechanisms for decentralized firms when division managers have an incentive to misrepresent project quality and to minimize privately costly but value-enhancing effort. We show that in the optimal mechanism firms always underinvest in capital relative to a naive application of the net present value (NPV) rule. We make a number of novel cross-sectional predictions about the severity of the underinvestment problem and the composition of managerial compensation contracts. We also find that firms will optimally give greater performance-based pay (at the expense of fixed wages) to managers of higher quality projects to mitigate the incentive for managers to overstate project quality. Managers may thus receive greater performance-based pay because they manage higher quality projects, not that greater performance-based pay causes firm value to increase.","['Antonio E.

"Forecasting crashes: trading volume, past returns, and conditional skewness in stock prices","We develop a series of cross-sectional regression specifications to forecast skewness in the daily returns of individual stocks. Negative skewness is most pronounced in stocks that have experienced (1) an increase in trading volume relative to trend over the prior six months, consistent with the model of Hong and Stein (NBER Working Paper, 1999), and (2) positive returns over the prior 36 months, which fits with a number of theories, most notably Blanchard and Watson's (Crises in Economic and Financial Structure. Lexington Books, Lexington, MA, 1982, pp. 295–315) rendition of stock-price bubbles. Analogous results also obtain when we attempt to forecast the skewness of the aggregate stock market, though our statistical power in this case is limited.","['Joseph Chen', 'Harrison Hong', 'Jeremy C Stein']","['Crashes', 'Trading volume', 'Skewness']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000666,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,61,3,Joseph Chen,2001,168.3724034395043
The distribution of realized stock return volatility,"We examine “realized” daily equity return volatilities and correlations obtained from high-frequency intraday transaction prices on individual stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We find that the unconditional distributions of realized variances and covariances are highly right-skewed, while the realized logarithmic standard deviations and correlations are approximately Gaussian, as are the distributions of the returns scaled by realized standard deviations. Realized volatilities and correlations show strong temporal dependence and appear to be well described by long-memory processes. Finally, there is strong evidence that realized volatilities and correlations move together in a manner broadly consistent with latent factor structure.","['Torben G.

Stock option plans for non-executive employees,"We examine determinants of non-executive employee stock option holdings, grants, and exercises for 756 firms during 1994–1997. We find that firms use greater stock option compensation when facing capital requirements and financing constraints. Our results are also consistent with firms using options to attract and retain certain types of employees as well as to create incentives to increase firm value. After controlling for economic determinants and stock returns, option exercises are greater (less) when the firm's stock price hits 52-week highs (lows), which confirms in a broad sample the psychological bias documented by Heath et al. (Quarterly Journal of Economics 114 (1999) 601–628).","['John E. Core', 'Wayne R.

Corporate payout policy and managerial stock incentives,"We examine how corporate payout policy is affected by managerial stock incentives using data on more than 1,100 nonfinancial firms during 1993–97. We find that management stock ownership is associated with higher payouts by firms with potentially the greatest agency problems – those with low management stock ownership and few investment opportunities or high free cash flow. We also find that management stock options are related to the composition of payouts. We find a strong negative relationship between dividends and management stock options, as predicted by Lambert et al (1989), and a positive relationship between repurchases and management stock options. Our results suggest that the growth in stock options may help to explain the rise in repurchases at the expense of dividends.","['George W.

The performance of professional market timers: daily evidence from executed strategies,"We examine the performance of 30 professional market timers during 1986–1994. Prior studies have analyzed implicit recommendations from mutual fund returns or explicit recommendations from newsletters. We analyze explicit recommendations executed in customer accounts. Using four tests, three benchmark portfolios, and daily data, we find significant unconditional and conditional ability that is robust with respect to transaction costs and survivorship bias. Relative ability persists and varies with the frequency of recommendation changes. When recommendations of successful timers are observed monthly instead of daily, significant ability generally disappears. Hence, the frequency with which recommendations are observed can change inferences regarding ability.","['Don M Chance', 'Michael L Hemler']","['Market timing', 'Performance evaluation', 'Portfolio management', 'Asset allocation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000812,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,62,2,Don M Chance,2001,168.3724034395043
"Information production, dilution costs, and optimal security design","We investigate the problem of a firm wishing to finance a project by issuing securities under asymmetric information. We find that, when outside investors can produce (noisy) information on the firm's quality, the degree of information asymmetry resulting in equilibrium is endogenous and depends on the information sensitivity of the security issued. Thus, in contrast to the prediction of the pecking order theory (see, e.g. Myers and Majluf, J. Financial Econom. 13 (1984) 187) a security with low sensitivity to private information, such as debt, does not always dominate one with high information sensitivity, such as equity. A firm's preference for equity rather than debt depends on the costs of information production, the precision of the information-production technology, and the extent of the information asymmetry. We also study the optimal security design problem and find that, depending on the cost and precision of the information-production technology, risky debt or a composite security with a convex payoff emerges as optimal securities.","['Paolo Fulghieri', 'Dmitry Lukin']","['Security design', 'Information production', 'Pecking order theory']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0100054X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,61,1,Paolo Fulghieri,2001,168.3724034395043
Managerial timing and corporate liquidity:,"We investigate the timing of open market share repurchases and the resultant impact on firm liquidity. Using the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's unique disclosure environment, we identify the exact implementation dates for more than five thousand equity buybacks. We find that managers exhibit substantial timing ability. Consistent with the information-asymmetry hypothesis, bid–ask spreads widen and depths narrow during repurchase periods. We decompose bid–ask spreads and show that adverse selection costs increase substantially as market participants respond to the presence of informed managerial trading. Our findings provide additional insight into how markets process information and have significant implications for corporate payout and disclosure policies.","['Paul Brockman', 'Dennis Y.

Bankers on boards:,"We investigate the trade-off between the benefits from bank monitoring when a banker is represented on a firm's board and the costs from two sources: conflicts of interests between lenders and shareholders, and U.S. legal doctrines that generate lender liability for bankers on boards of firms in financial distress. Consistent with high costs of active involvement, bankers are on boards of large, stable firms with high proportions of collateralizable assets and low reliance on short-term financing. While permitting banks to own equity could mitigate conflicts, the protection of shareholder versus creditor rights could continue to reduce the role of U.S. banks in corporate governance.","['Randall S Kroszner', 'Philip E Strahan']","['Banking and commerce', 'Boards of directors', 'Conflicts of interest', 'Lender liability']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000824,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,62,3,Randall S Kroszner,2001,168.3724034395043
Predictable changes in yields and forward rates,"We make two contributions to the study of interest rates. The first is to characterize their dynamics in a new way. We estimate forecasting relations based on one-period changes in forward rates, which are more easily compared than earlier work on yields to the stationary theory of bond pricing. The second is to approximate these dynamics and other salient features of interest rates with an affine model. We show that models with “negative” factors come closer to accounting for the properties of interest rates, including their dynamics, than multifactor Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models.","['David Backus', 'Silverio Foresi', 'Abon Mozumdar', 'Liuren Wu']","['Forecasting', 'Term premiums', 'Expectations hypothesis', 'Pricing kernels', 'Affine models']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0000088X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,3,David Backus,2001,168.3724034395043
Pricing and hedging in incomplete markets,"We present a new approach for positioning, pricing, and hedging in incomplete markets that bridges standard arbitrage pricing and expected utility maximization. Our approach for determining whether an investor should undertake a particular position involves specifying a set of probability measures and associated floors which expected payoffs must exceed in order for the investor to consider the hedged and financed investment to be acceptable. By assuming that the liquid assets are priced so that each portfolio of assets has negative expected return under at least one measure, we derive a counterpart to the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing. We also derive a counterpart to the second fundamental theorem, which leads to unique derivative security pricing and hedging even though markets are incomplete. For products that are not spanned by the liquid assets of the economy, we show how our methodology provides more realistic bid–ask spreads.","['Peter Carr', 'Helyette Geman', 'Dilip B Madan']","['Risk management', 'State price density', 'Unique Martingale measure', 'Complete markets', 'Option pricing']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000757,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,62,1,Peter Carr,2001,168.3724034395043
Leverage and internal capital markets: evidence from leveraged recapitalizations,"We study the internal allocation of resources for diversified firms that complete a leveraged recapitalization. Before the recapitalization, internal capital markets allocate investment to high q segments. After the recapitalization, segment investment becomes less sensitive to q and more sensitive to segment cash flow. We show that firm value is positively related to investment's sensitivity to segment q and negatively related to investment's sensitivity to segment cash flow. Our analysis highlights an indirect cost of debt that has received little attention: pressure to meet interest obligations creates an incentive to emphasize investments that generate high levels of current cash flow.","['Urs C.

Linking pay to performance—compensation proposals in the S&P 500,"We study the proposal of manager-sponsored compensation plans linking pay to performance by S&P 500 firms in the 1990s. We examine the market perception of these proposals and the characteristics of the firms that propose them. Shareholders gain at the announcement of the plans, especially when the plans are directed toward the firm's top executives. Proposing firms are those that can most benefit from the plans, given their asset type and agency considerations. Firms with more potential agency costs have the highest vote-for percentages for the plans. However, shareholders are less approving of plans with negative features such as high dilution levels. Our work suggests that stock-based compensation plans are helpful in improving managerial efforts to increase shareholder wealth.","['Angela G Morgan', 'Annette B Poulsen']","['Incentives', 'Executive compensation', 'Proxy voting']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000848,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,62,3,Angela G Morgan,2001,168.3724034395043
Aggregate price effects of institutional trading: a study of mutual fund flow and market returns,"We study the relation between market returns and aggregate flow into U.S. equity funds, using daily flow data. The concurrent daily relation is positive. Our tests show that this concurrent relation reflects flow and institutional trading affecting returns. This daily relation is similar in magnitude to the price impact reported for an individual institution's trades in a stock. Aggregate flow also follows market returns with a one-day lag. The lagged response of flow suggests either a common response of both returns and flow to new information, or positive feedback trading.","['Roger M Edelen', 'Jerold B Warner']","['Mutual funds', 'Institutional trading', 'Price impact']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000854,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,59,2,Roger M Edelen,2001,168.3724034395043
The theory and practice of corporate finance: evidence from the field,"We survey 392 CFOs about the cost of capital, capital budgeting, and capital structure. Large firms rely heavily on present value techniques and the capital asset pricing model, while small firms are relatively likely to use the payback criterion. A surprising number of firms use firm risk rather than project risk in evaluating new investments. Firms are concerned about financial flexibility and credit ratings when issuing debt, and earnings per share dilution and recent stock price appreciation when issuing equity. We find some support for the pecking-order and trade-off capital structure hypotheses but little evidence that executives are concerned about asset substitution, asymmetric information, transactions costs, free cash flows, or personal taxes.","['John R Graham', 'Campbell R Harvey']","['Capital structure', 'Cost of capital', 'Cost of equity', 'Capital budgeting', 'Discount rates', 'Project valuation', 'Survey']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000447,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.355655798129704,60,2,John R Graham,2001,168.3724034395043
DOS Kapital: Has antitrust action against Microsoft created value in the computer industry?,"Antitrust enforcement that efficiently constrains Microsoft's behavior benefits firms supplying complements to and/or substitutes for Microsoft's operating system and applications software. However, from 1991 through 1997, 29 reports of federal antitrust enforcement action against Microsoft were accompanied by declines in the value of an index of 159 computer industry firms (excluding Microsoft). The mean loss to those firms exceeded $1 billion per event. Eight retreats or setbacks in enforcement were associated with increased computer sector value. Thus, financial markets reveal compelling evidence against the joint hypothesis that (a) Microsoft conduct is anticompetitive and (b) antitrust policy enforcement produces net efficiency gains.","['George Bittlingmayer', 'Thomas W Hazlett']","['Financial effects of regulation', 'Antitrust', 'Monopoly', 'Computer industry', 'Microsoft']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000537,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,55,3,George Bittlingmayer,2000,168.28825930984937
When is time continuous?,"Continuous-time stochastic processes are approximations to physically realizable phenomena. We quantify one aspect of the approximation errors by characterizing the asymptotic distribution of the replication errors that arise from delta-hedging derivative securities in discrete time, and introducing the notion of temporal granularity which measures the extent to which discrete-time implementations of continuous-time models can track the payoff of a derivative security. We show that granularity is a particular function of a derivative contract's terms and the parameters of the underlying stochastic process. Explicit expressions for the granularity of geometric Brownian motion and an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process for call and put options are derived, and we perform Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the empirical properties of granularity.","['Dimitris Bertsimas', 'Leonid Kogan', 'Andrew W.

Uniformly least powerful tests of market efficiency,"Defenders of market efficiency argue that anomalies involving long-term abnormal returns are not robust to alternative methodologies. We argue that because various methodologies use different weighting schemes, the magnitude of abnormal returns should differ, and in a predictable manner. Three problems are identified that cause low power in value-weighted three-factor time series regressions when abnormal returns following managerial actions are being estimated. We illustrate the sensitivities in the context of the new issues puzzle as well as with simulations. More generally, multifactor models as currently used do not, and cannot, test market efficiency.","['Tim Loughran', 'Jay R.

Financial markets and the allocation of capital,"Financial markets appear to improve the allocation of capital. Across 65 countries, those with developed financial sectors increase investment more in their growing industries, and decrease investment more in their declining industries, than those with undeveloped financial sectors. The efficiency of capital allocation is negatively correlated with the extent of state ownership in the economy, positively correlated with the amount of firm-specific information in domestic stock returns, and positively correlated with the legal protection of minority investors. In particular, strong minority investor rights appear to curb overinvestment in declining industries.",['Jeffrey Wurgler'],"['Capital allocation', 'Investment', 'Economic growth', 'State ownership']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000702,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,58,1,Jeffrey Wurgler,2000,168.28825930984937
Speed of issuance and the adequacy of disclosure in the 144A high-yield debt market,"I document the shift of high-yield issuance from the public to the Rule 144A private placement market and exploit data on credit spreads to investigate whether investors regard disclosure in the two markets as comparable. The key implications of the inadequate-disclosure hypothesis are that investors require premiums on 144A securities and that such premiums are largest for first-time bond issuers and privately owned firms about whom less information is publicly available. I find that 144A premiums, though positive initially, have vanished over time, and I find no evidence of larger 144A premiums for first-time issuers or private firms. Investors do, however, require premiums of first-time issuers, and to a lesser extent of privately owned firms, regardless of whether securities are issued in the 144A or public market. These findings imply that sophisticated investors do not value the incremental information provided by securities registration, but do value ongoing disclosure.",['George W Fenn'],"['Junk bonds', 'Rule 144A', 'Private placements']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000453,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,56,3,George W Fenn,2000,168.28825930984937

Just another day in the inter-bank foreign exchange market,"In this paper, I develop a theory of bid–ask quotes provided by foreign exchange dealers in the inter-bank market based on their beliefs and their inventory positions. I then build an agent-based model of the inter-dealer market where dealers learn in a Bayesian manner from quotes from other dealers.

Investor protection and corporate governance,"Recent research has documented large differences among countries in ownership concentration in publicly traded firms, in the breadth and depth of capital markets, in dividend policies, and in the access of firms to external finance. A common element to the explanations of these differences is how well investors, both shareholders and creditors, are protected by law from expropriation by the managers and controlling shareholders of firms. We describe the differences in laws and the effectiveness of their enforcement across countries, discuss the possible origins of these differences, summarize their consequences, and assess potential strategies of corporate governance reform. We argue that the legal approach is a more fruitful way to understand corporate governance and its reform than the conventional distinction between bank-centered and market-centered financial systems.","['Rafael La Porta', 'Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes', 'Andrei Shleifer', 'Robert Vishny']","['Investor, protection', 'Corporate governance', 'Law']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000659,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,58,1,Rafael La Porta,2000,168.28825930984937
When an event is not an event: the curious case of an emerging market,"Shares trading in the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores do not seem to react to company news. Using a sample of Mexican corporate news announcements from the period July 1994 through June 1997, this paper finds that there is nothing unusual about returns, volatility of returns, volume of trade or bid–ask spreads in the event window. We provide evidence that suggests that unrestricted insider trading causes prices to fully incorporate the information before its public release. The paper thus points toward a methodology for ranking emerging stock markets in terms of their market integrity, an approach that can be used with the limited data available in such markets.","['Utpal Bhattacharya', 'Hazem Daouk', 'Brian Jorgenson', 'Carl-Heinrich Kehr']","['Insider trading', 'Event studies', 'Emerging markets']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000458,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,55,1,Utpal Bhattacharya,2000,168.28825930984937

The information content of stock markets: why do emerging markets have synchronous stock price movements?,"Stock prices move together more in poor economies than in rich economies. This finding is not due to market size and is only partially explained by higher fundamentals correlation in low-income economies. However, measures of property rights do explain this difference. The systematic component of returns variation is large in emerging markets, and appears unrelated to fundamentals co-movement, consistent with noise trader risk. Among developed economy stock markets, higher firm-specific returns variation is associated with stronger public investor property rights. We propose that strong property rights promote informed arbitrage, which capitalizes detailed firm-specific information.","['Randall Morck', 'Bernard Yeung', 'Wayne Yu']","['Asset pricing', 'Information and market efficiency', 'Event studies', 'International financial markets', 'Financial economics']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000714,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,58,1,Randall Morck,2000,168.28825930984937
Seasoned public offerings: resolution of the ‘new issues puzzle’,"The ‘new issues puzzle’ is that stocks of common stock issuers subsequently underperform nonissuers matched on size and book-to-market ratio. With 7000+ seasoned equity and debt issues, we document that issuer underperformance reflects lower systematic risk exposure for issuing firms relative to the matches. A consistent explanation is that, as equity issuers lower leverage, their exposures to unexpected inflation and default risks decrease, thus decreasing their stocks’ expected returns relative to matched firms. Equity issues also significantly increase stock liquidity (turnover), again lowering expected returns relative to nonissuers. We conclude that the ‘new issue puzzle’ is explained by a failure of the matched-firm technique to provide a proper control for risk. This conclusion is robust to issue characteristics and the choice of factor model framework.","['B.Espen Eckbo', 'Ronald W.

Herding among security analysts,"The paper shows that the buy or sell recommendations of security analysts have a significant positive influence on the recommendations of the next two analysts. This influence can be traced to short-lived information in the most recent revisions. In contrast, the influence of the prevailing consensus is not stronger if the consensus accurately forecasts subsequent stock price movements. This indicates consensus herding consistent with models in which analysts herd based on little information. The consensus also has a stronger influence when market conditions are favorable.

On the optimality of resetting executive stock options,"The practice of resetting strike prices on underwater executive stock options has drawn criticism for weakening managerial incentives. Our model shows that although the anticipation of resetting can negatively affect initial incentives, resetting can still be an important, value-enhancing aspect of compensation contracts, even from an ex-ante standpoint. In fact, we find that some resetting is almost always optimal. The relative advantages of resetting diminish with greater ability of managers to influence the resetting process, greater relative importance of external factors on stock performance, and lower costs of replacing incumbent managers.","['Viral V.

A study towards a unified approach to the joint estimation of objective and risk neutral measures for the purpose of options valuation,"The purpose of this paper is to bridge two strands of the literature, one pertaining to the objective or physical measure used to model an underlying asset and the other pertaining to the risk-neutral measure used to price derivatives. We propose a generic procedure using simultaneously the fundamental price, St, and a set of option contracts [(σitI)i=1,m] where m⩾1 and σitI is the Black–Scholes implied volatility. We use Heston's (1993. Review of Financial Studies 6, 327–343) model as an example, and appraise univariate and multivariate estimation of the model in terms of pricing and hedging performance. Our results, based on the S&P 500 index contract, show dominance of univariate approach, which relies solely on options data. A by-product of this finding is that we uncover a remarkably simple volatility extraction filter based on a polynomial lag structure of implied volatilities. The bivariate approach, involving both the fundamental security and an option contract, appears useful when the information from the cash market reflected in the conditional kurtosis provides support to price long term.","['Mikhail Chernov', 'Eric Ghysels']","['Derivative securities', 'Efficient method of moments', 'State price densities', 'Stochastic volatility models', 'Filtering']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000465,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,56,3,Mikhail Chernov,2000,168.28825930984937
From cradle to grave: How to loot a 401(k) plan,"The regulations governing asset distributions from many retirement plans give participants the option to time retirement or rollovers from the plan strategically. They possess a long-lived put option, whose exercise price resets periodically to the current value of the assets in the plan. I derive a recursive closed-form valuation formula for the option and develop a numerical algorithm for implementing the result. I find that, for reasonable assumptions about volatility and life expectancy, the option's value may approach 40% of the value of the assets in the plan, financed entirely by those still contributing. This wealth transfer can, however, be easily avoided by making a simple change to the current regulations governing valuation and payout of these retirement plans.",['Richard Stanton'],"['401(k) plan', 'Pension plan', 'Rollover', 'Option valuation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000489,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,56,3,Richard Stanton,2000,168.28825930984937
Controlling stockholders and the disciplinary role of corporate payout policy: a study of the Times Mirror Company,"The Times Mirror Company, a NYSE-listed Fortune 500 firm controlled for 100 years by the Chandler family, hired an industry outsider as CEO in 1995 following an extended period of poor operating and stock price performance under non-family management. This change was apparently an unintended consequence of actions taken by old management to fund its capital expansion plans while satisfying the family's desire for dividends. Specifically, in 1994 old management agreed to (1) sell TM's cable business and reinvest most of the $1.3 billion proceeds in new technology, and (2) maintain the Chandlers’ dividends while radically cutting those to minority stockholders. While Wall Street reacted favorably to the cable sale, it punished TM's stock when it later learned about management's reinvestment plans. Shortly thereafter TM's board brought in a noted financial disciplinarian, who as CEO substantially increased stockholder value by terminating low return investments and distributing free cash flow. While pressure to pay dividends and monitoring by large block stockholders ultimately improved TM's performance, the path to this outcome was slow and circuitous, so that these disciplinary forces were weaker than theory typically implies.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo']","['Payout policy', 'Controlling stockholders', 'Family control']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000398,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,56,2,Harry DeAngelo,2000,168.28825930984937

The potential for market segmentation and price discrimination by the underwriter is used to analyze the structuring process.

Corporate policies restricting trading by insiders,"This paper examines policies and procedures put in place by corporations to regulate trading in the stock by the firm's own insiders. Over 92% of our sample companies have their own policies restricting trading by insiders, and 78% have explicit blackout periods during which the company prohibits trading by its insiders. Our data indicate that blackout periods successfully suppress trading, both purchases and sales, by insiders, and that the blackout period is associated with a bid–ask spread that's narrower by about two basis points. Consistent with this effect on the spread, allowed insider trades are modestly more profitable than insider trades made during prohibited blackout periods.","['J.C Bettis', 'J.L Coles', 'M.L Lemmon']","['Insider trading', 'Regulation', 'Corporate policy', 'Liquidity']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000556,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,57,2,J.C Bettis,2000,168.28825930984937
An empirical examination of the convexity bias in the pricing of interest rate swaps,"This paper examines the convexity bias, caused by the non-linearity of payoffs, in the pricing of interest rate swaps off the Eurocurrency futures curve. The evidence from four major currencies – $, £, DM and ¥ – during 1987–1996 suggests that swaps were initially being priced off the futures curve (ignoring the convexity adjustment); subsequently, the market swap rates drifted below the rates implied by futures prices. After rejecting alternative explanations, we use alternative term structure models to show that the convexity bias is related to the empirically observed swap-futures differential. We interpret these results as evidence of mispricing of swap contracts during the early years, which was eliminated over time.","['Anurag Gupta', 'Marti G.

Aggressive orders have larger price impacts but smaller opportunity costs than passive orders. Price impacts are amplified by large orders, small firms, and volatile stock prices. To minimize the implementation shortfall, the optimal strategy is to enter buy (sell) orders at the bid (ask). Aggressive buy (sell) orders tend to follow other aggressive buy (sell) orders and occur when bid–ask spreads are narrow and depth on the same (opposite) side of the limit book is large (small).

After controlling for the return impact of order imbalance, the volatility–volume relation becomes much weaker.

Can transparent markets survive?,"This paper investigates whether transparent markets can survive when faced with direct competition from less transparent markets. We first construct a game-theoretic model in which in equilibrium the low-transparency dealers capture early order flow, and use the resulting informational advantage to quote narrower spreads and earn more profits than their more transparent competitors. We then conduct a laboratory experiment that tests and supports all of these predictions. A second experiment shows that most dealers choose to be of lower transparency when they are allowed to do so. However, the informational advantage of low-transparency decreases as there are more such dealers, while the high-transparency dealers get increasing benefit from informed traders who attempt to broadcast deceptive trades. As a result, a small number of transparent dealers persist in our markets.","['Robert Bloomfield', ""Maureen O'Hara""]","['Market microstructure', 'Experimental economics', 'Stock market competition']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000562,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,55,3,Robert Bloomfield,2000,168.28825930984937
Financial flexibility and the choice between dividends and stock repurchases,"This paper measures the growth in open market stock repurchases and the manner in which stock repurchases and dividends are used by U.S. corporations. Stock repurchases and dividends are used at different times from one another, by different kinds of firms. Stock repurchases are very pro-cyclical, while dividends increase steadily over time. Dividends are paid by firms with higher “permanent” operating cash flows, while repurchases are used by firms with higher “temporary”, non-operating cash flows. Repurchasing firms also have much more volatile cash flows and distributions. Finally, firms repurchase stock following poor stock market performance and increase dividends following good performance. These results are consistent with the view that the flexibility inherent in repurchase programs is one reason why they are sometimes used instead of dividends.","['Murali Jagannathan', 'Clifford P Stephens', 'Michael S Weisbach']","['Payout policy', 'Stock repurchases', 'Dividends']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000611,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,57,3,Murali Jagannathan,2000,168.28825930984937

Commonality in liquidity,"Traditionally and understandably, the microscope of market microstructure has focused on attributes of single assets. Little theoretical attention and virtually no empirical work has been devoted to common determinants of liquidity nor to their empirical manifestation, correlated movements in liquidity. But a wider-angle lens exposes an imposing image of commonality. Quoted spreads, quoted depth, and effective spreads co-move with market- and industry-wide liquidity. After controlling for well-known individual liquidity determinants, such as volatility, volume, and price, common influences remain significant and material. Recognizing the existence of commonality is a key to uncovering some suggestive evidence that inventory risks and asymmetric information both affect intertemporal changes in liquidity.","['Tarun Chordia', 'Richard Roll', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam']","['Liquidity', 'Trading costs', 'Co-movement', 'Microstructure']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000574,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,56,1,Tarun Chordia,2000,168.28825930984937

We show that the founder of the firm can optimally choose an ownership structure with several large shareholders to force them to form coalitions to obtain control.

The model has implications for the optimal bundling of cash flow and voting rights, and for the optimal number and size of shareholders.","['Morten Bennedsen', 'Daniel Wolfenzon']","['Closely held corporations', 'Ownership structure', 'Control dilution', 'Controlling coalition', 'One-share–one vote']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000684,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,58,1,Morten Bennedsen,2000,168.28825930984937
Why firms issue targeted stock,"We analyze market reaction to targeted stock issuances and investigate possible motives for their use. We find a statistically significant abnormal return of 3.61% within a three-day window around the announcement of proposed targeted stock issuances, possibly attributable to greater information on targeted stock segments as well as monitoring and motivational advantages. We find lower tax-loss carry forwards among firms that issue targeted stock compared to those that spin off segments, suggesting that tax reasons motivate targeted stock use. The return and cash flows of targeted stocks are affected more by their common corporate affiliation, although industry influences remain strong.","[""Julia D'Souza"", 'John Jacob']","['Tracking stock', 'Diversification', 'Corporate focus', 'Corporate structure', 'Ownership structure']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000477,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,56,3,Julia D'Souza,2000,168.28825930984937
"‘Time to build, option value and investment decisions’: a comment","We correct the analysis of the model of time to build in Majd and Pindyck (1987 Journal of Financial Economics 18, 7–27) for the omission of an essential optimality condition. Our analysis reveals an additional insight: long times to build reduce the effects of increased project value volatility (i.e., higher investment thresholds) in comparison to standard real option models of investment under uncertainty, where investment is instantaneous. Thus, a ‘naı̈ve’ NPV rule can sometimes be an appropriate initial guide to investment.","['Alistair Milne', 'A Elizabeth Whalley']","['Irreversible investment', 'Time to build']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0000043X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,56,2,Alistair Milne,2000,168.28825930984937
Indexed executive stock options,"We design and derive a pricing model for an executive stock option with a strike price indexed to a benchmark and investigate its valuation and incentive implications. In both up and down markets, the indexed option filters out common risks beyond the executive's control, thereby increasing the efficiency of incentive contracts. The indexed option has a different payoff structure and much lower initial value than a traditional option. Incentive effects of the indexed option also differ from those of traditional options. We design an optional penalty function to reduce the payoff if executives manipulate specified model parameters such as volatility.","['Shane A Johnson', 'Yisong S Tian']","['Executive stock options', 'Executive compensation', 'Option valuation', 'Indexed options']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000507,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,57,1,Shane A Johnson,2000,168.28825930984937
"Liquidity, investment ability, and mutual fund structure","We develop a model of the mutual fund industry in which the management fees and loads charged by actively managed open-end funds and average fund returns are determined endogenously in a competitive market setting. It is shown that heterogeneity in managerial skills at investing and minimizing costs, and the existence of investor clienteles with differing liquidity and marketing needs, gives rise to a variety of open-end fund structures that differ in the average return delivered to investors. Managers choose a fund's structure to maximize the rents they capture from their ability, taking into account the effect on investor flows. In equilibrium, funds that constrain liquidity withdrawals may have to charge lower fees and share some profits in the form of higher investor returns, when there is relative scarcity of investors with low liquidity needs.","['Vikram Nanda', 'M.P Narayanan', 'Vincent A Warther']","['Mutual funds', 'Liquidity', 'Loads', 'Fund performance', 'Fund returns']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000635,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,57,3,Vikram Nanda,2000,168.28825930984937
Abnormal returns to rivals of acquisition targets: A test of the `acquisition probability hypothesis',"We develop and test the Acquisition Probability Hypothesis, which asserts that rivals of initial acquisition targets earn abnormal returns because of the increased probability that they will be targets themselves. On average, rival firms earn positive abnormal returns regardless of the form and outcome of acquisition. These returns increase significantly with the magnitude of surprise about the initial acquisition. Moreover, the cross-sectional variation of rival abnormal returns in the announcement period is systematically related to variables associated with the probability of acquisition. In addition, rivals that subsequently become targets earn significantly higher abnormal returns in the announcement period.","['Moon H Song', 'Ralph A Walkling']","['Acquisition', 'Rivals', 'Tender offer', 'Mergers', 'Collusion']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000483,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,55,2,Moon H Song,2000,168.28825930984937
Universal banking and the performance of German firms,"We empirically investigate the influence of German universal banks on the performance of German firms. We take into account banks’ control rights from equity ownership, banks’ proxy-voting rights, and the concentration of control rights from equity ownership (which includes complex forms such as pyramids, cross-shareholdings, and stocks with multiple votes). We also account for voting restrictions and the German codetermination system (under which employees of large firms have control rights that are unrelated to equity ownership). We find that firm performance improves to the extent that equity control rights are concentrated. Moreover, bank control rights from equity ownership significantly improve firm performance beyond what nonbank blockholders can achieve.","['Gary Gorton', 'Frank A Schmid']","['Corporate control', 'Corporate finance', 'Ownership structure', 'Universal banking']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000660,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,58,1,Gary Gorton,2000,168.28825930984937
The `repricing’ of executive stock options,"We examine a sample of firms that reset the exercise prices on their executive options. These repricings follow a period of about one year of poor firm-specific performance in which the average firm loses one-fourth of its value. No other offsetting changes to option terms or compensation are made, and many firms reprice more than once. Without repricing, a majority of the options would have been at-the-money within two years. We find that when faced with circumstances in which repricing might be chosen, firms with greater agency problems, smaller size, and insider- dominated boards are more likely to reprice.","['Don M Chance', 'Raman Kumar', 'Rebecca B Todd']","['Executive', 'Option', 'Incentives', 'Repricing']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000532,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,57,1,Don M Chance,2000,168.28825930984937
Managerial discipline and corporate restructuring following performance declines,"We examine the incidence of disciplinary events that reduce the control of current managers, and corporate restructuring among firms experiencing a large decline in operating performance during an active takeover period (1985–1988) and a less active period (1989–1992). We document a significant decline in the disciplinary events from the active to the less active period that is driven by a significant decline in disciplinary takeovers, those takeovers that result in a top executive change. Following the performance decline, however, there is a substantial amount of corporate restructuring, and a significant improvement in operating performance, during both the active and the less active takeover period. We conclude that, although some managerial disciplinary events are related to overall takeover activity, the decline in takeover activity does not result in fewer performance-enhancing restructurings following performance declines.","['David J Denis', 'Timothy A Kruse']","['Management turnover', 'Takeovers', 'Restructuring']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000550,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,55,3,David J Denis,2000,168.28825930984937
Altering the terms of executive stock options,"We examine the practice of resetting the terms of previously-issued executive stock options. We identify properties of reset options, develop a model for valuing resettable options, and characterize the firms that have reset options. We find the vast majority of options are reset at-the-money, resulting, on average, in the strike price dropping 40%. Our valuation model suggests that resetting has only a small impact on the ex-ante value of an option award, but the ex-post gain can be substantial. Finally, we find resetting has a strong negative relation with firm performance even after correcting for industry performance.","['Menachem Brenner', 'Rangarajan K Sundaram', 'David Yermack']","['Executive stock options', 'Executive compensation', 'Resetting', 'Repricing', 'Valuation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000520,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,57,1,Menachem Brenner,2000,168.28825930984937
The separation of ownership and control in East Asian Corporations,"We examine the separation of ownership and control for 2,980 corporations in nine East Asian countries. In all countries, voting rights frequently exceed cash-flow rights via pyramid structures and cross-holdings. The separation of ownership and control is most pronounced among family-controlled firms and small firms. More than two-thirds of firms are controlled by a single shareholder. Managers of closely held firms tend to be relatives of the controlling shareholder's family. Older firms are generally family-controlled, dispelling the notion that ownership becomes dispersed over time. Finally, significant corporate wealth in East Asia is concentrated among a few families.","['Stijn Claessens', 'Simeon Djankov', 'Larry H.P Lang']","['Ownership', 'Control', 'East Asian corporations']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000672,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,58,1,Stijn Claessens,2000,168.28825930984937
The value and incentive effects of nontraditional executive stock option plans,"We examine the value and incentive effects of six nontraditional executive stock options: premium options, performance-vested options, repriceable options, purchased options, reload options, and indexed options. With reasonable parameter values, four options have lower value than a traditional option when granted, and large differences in value are evident across the types. Holding option value constant, five options create stronger incentives than traditional options to increase stock price, five create stronger incentives to increase risk, and three create stronger incentives to reduce dividend yield. Changing various option-specific parameters can produce large changes in incentive strengths.","['Shane A. Johnson', 'Yisong S.

"Alternative flotation methods, adverse selection, and ownership structure: evidence from seasoned equity issuance in the U.K.","We examine valuation effects of announcements of seasoned equity issuance and assess the impact of the choice of flotation method in the U.K. Rights offerings are predominant, but in 1986, British firms gained the flexibility to conduct placings, which are comparable to U.S. firm commitment offerings. A placing is a fixed-price bought deal that increases ownership dispersion. Placings generate significantly positive share price effects, whereas rights offerings have large negative valuation effects that become more adverse after 1985. We conclude that the option to conduct placings enhances the ability of firms to signal their quality and to use a seasoned equity offering to reduce ownership concentration.","['M.B Slovin', 'M.E Sushka', 'K.W.L Lai']","['Equity issuance', 'Flotation method', 'Rights offerings', 'Placings', 'Ownership concentration']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000544,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,57,2,M.B Slovin,2000,168.28825930984937
Is the abnormal return following equity issuances anomalous?,"We examine whether a distinct equity issuer underperformance anomaly exists. In a sample of initial public offering (IPO) and seasoned equity offering (SEO) firms from 1975 to 1992, we find that underperformance is concentrated primarily in small issuing firms with low book-to-market ratios. SEO firms, that underperform these standard benchmarks have time series returns that covary with factor returns constructed from nonissuing firms. We conclude that the stock returns following equity issues reflect a more pervasive return pattern in the broader set of publicly traded companies.","['Alon Brav', 'Christopher Geczy', 'Paul A.

The cash-flow permanence and information content of dividend increases versus repurchases,"We hypothesize that firms choose dividend increases to distribute relatively permanent cash-flow shocks and repurchases to distribute more transient shocks. As predicted, we find that post-shock cash flows of dividend increasing firms exhibit less reversion to pre-shock levels compared with repurchasing firms. We also examine whether the stock market uses the announcement of the payout method to update its beliefs about the permanence of cash-flow shocks. Controlling for payout size and the market's expectation about the permanence of the cash-flow shock, the stock price reaction to dividend increases is more positive than the reaction to repurchases.","['Wayne Guay', 'Jarrad Harford']","['Payout policy', 'Stock repurchase', 'Buy-back', 'Payout choice', 'Dividend signaling']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000623,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,57,3,Wayne Guay,2000,168.28825930984937

Comparing asset pricing models: an investment perspective,"We investigate the portfolio choices of mean-variance-optimizing investors who use sample evidence to update prior beliefs centered on either risk-based or characteristic-based pricing models. With dogmatic beliefs in such models and an unconstrained ratio of position size to capital, optimal portfolios can differ across models to economically significant degrees. The differences are substantially reduced by modest uncertainty about the models’ pricing abilities. When the ratio of position size to capital is subject to realistic constraints, the differences in portfolios across models become even less important and are nonexistent in some cases.","['Ľuboš Pástor', 'Robert F.

The initial purchases resulted in a wealth gain to shareholders of approximately $400 million. Anticipated synergies did not materialize, however, and Sears’ retail performance deteriorated. Coincident with pressure from institutional investor activists in 1992, Sears announced the divestiture of financial services and a refocusing on retail operations.

Money chasing deals? The impact of fund inflows on private equity valuation,"We show that inflows of capital into venture funds increase the valuation of these funds’ new investments. This effect is robust to (i) controlling for firm characteristics and public market valuations, (ii) examining first differences, and (iii) using inflows into leveraged buyout funds as an instrumental variable. Interaction terms suggest that the impact of venture capital inflows on prices is greatest in states with the most venture capital activity. Changes in valuations do not appear related to the ultimate success of these firms. The findings are consistent with competition for a limited number of attractive investments being responsible for rising prices.","['Paul Gompers', 'Josh Lerner']","['Venture capital', 'Financing']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000525,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.43981408273967126,55,2,Paul Gompers,2000,168.28825930984937

The voting analysis documents that sponsor identity, issue type, prior performance and time period are important influences on the voting outcome.

Understanding the determinants of managerial ownership and the link between ownership and performance,"Both managerial ownership and performance are endogenously determined by exogenous (and only partly observed) changes in the firm's contracting environment. We extend the cross-sectional results of Demsetz and Lehn (1985), (Journal of Political Economy, 93, 1155–1177) and use panel data to show that managerial ownership is explained by key variables in the contracting environment in ways consistent with the predictions of principal-agent models. A large fraction of the cross-sectional variation in managerial ownership is explained by unobserved firm heterogeneity. Moreover, after controlling both for observed firm characteristics and firm fixed effects, we cannot conclude (econometrically) that changes in managerial ownership affect firm performance.","['Charles P.

Commercial banks as underwriters: implications for the going public process,"Commercial bank entry into securities underwriting can affect underwriter behavior because, unlike investment houses, banks also lend to firms. This raises several issues. Are banks better certifiers of firms’ securities than investment houses? If banks hold equity in firms rather than debt, does this make certification more credible? Would one type of underwriter drive out the other? This paper provides a model for analyzing such issues, and derives several interesting results. First, banks, as lenders to firms, can actually be better certifiers than investment houses. Second, equity holding can hinder banks’ certification ability.

Deregulation and the adaptation of governance structure: the case of the U.S. airline industry,"Deregulation provides a natural experiment for examining how governance adapts to structural changes in the business environment. We investigate the evolution of governance structure, characterized by ownership concentration, compensation policy, and board composition, in the U.S. airline industry during a 22-year period surrounding the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Consistent with theory, we find that after deregulation (i) equity ownership is more concentrated, (ii) CEO pay increases, (iii) stock option grants to CEOs increase, and (iv) board size decreases. Airlines’ governance structures gravitate toward the system of governance mechanisms used by unregulated firms. The adaptation process is gradual, however, suggesting that it is costly to alter organizational capital.

Board meeting frequency and firm performance,"For 307 firms over the 1990–1994 period, I find that board meeting frequency is related to corporate governance and ownership characteristics in a manner that is consistent with contracting and agency theory. The annual number of board meetings is inversely related to firm value. This result is driven by increases in board activity following share price declines. I further find that operating performance improves following years of abnormal board activity. These improvements are most pronounced for firms with poor prior performance and firms not engaged in corporate control transactions.

The ‘9–10 Fund’ is based on the CRSP 9–10 Index, an index of small-cap stocks constituting the ninth and tenth deciles of NYSE market capitalization, although the 9–10 Fund incorporates investment rules and a trading strategy that are aimed at minimizing the potentially excessive trade costs associated with such illiquid stocks. As a result, the 9–10 Fund provided a 2.2% annual premium over the 9–10 Index for the 1982–1995 period.

The resolution of bankruptcy by auction: allocating the residual right of design,"In this paper, we examine the value of the right to choose the method of sale of corporate assets. We show that this right is valuable, and that its value comes from recognizing conflicting incentives of claimants at the time of sale. As with risky projects, senior and junior claimants are shown to have distinct preferences on a set of common auction procedures. They also differ on the issue of allocation of resources towards attracting bidders for the auction. As a consequence, the optimal allocation of the design right must depend on circumstances prevailing at the time of the sale. While, in general, selling the firm by auction does not guarantee the use of optimal selling arrangements, a suitable allocation of design rights may help mitigate inefficiency problems significantly.","['Sugato Bhattacharyya', 'Rajdeep Singh']","['Bankruptcy', 'Auctions', 'Residual rights']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000380,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,54,3,Sugato Bhattacharyya,1999,168.20411518019444
"Deregulation, disintermediation, and agency costs of debt: evidence from Japan1","Many Japanese firms reduced dependence on banks following financial deregulation in the 1980s. The financial architecture of Japanese firms after liberalization provides an opportunity to investigate the choice of financing with public bonds versus monitored bank loans. Examination of accounting and stock price data for a sample of Japanese firms in the late 1980s suggests that debt structure is related to variables that serve as proxies for agency costs of debt. In particular, we find that the proportion of bond debt is inversely related to growth opportunities, while the proportion of bank debt is positively related to growth opportunities.","['Christopher W.

The adaptive mesh model: a new approach to efficient option pricing,"Most derivative securities must be priced by numerical techniques. These models contain “distribution error” and “nonlinearity error”. The Adaptive Mesh Model (AMM) sharply reduces nonlinearity error by grafting one or more small sections of fine high-resolution lattice onto a tree with coarser time and price steps. Three different AMM structures are presented, one for pricing ordinary options, one for barrier options, and one for computing delta and gamma efficiently. The AMM approach can be adapted to a wide variety of contingent claims. For some common problems, accuracy increases by several orders of magnitude with no increase in execution time.","['Stephen Figlewski', 'Bin Gao']","['Adaptive Mesh', 'Option valuation', 'Lattice models', 'Barrier options', 'Numerical valuation techniques']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000240,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,53,3,Stephen Figlewski,1999,168.20411518019444
Investor flows and the assessed performance of open-end mutual funds,"Open-end equity funds provide a diversified equity positions with little direct cost to investors for liquidity. This study documents a statistically significant indirect cost in the form of a negative relation between a fund's abnormal return and investor flows. Controlling for this indirect cost of liquidity changes the average fund's abnormal return (net of expenses) from a statistically significant −1.6% per year to a statistically insignificant −0.2% and also fully explains the negative market-timing performance found in this and other studies of mutual fund returns. Thus, the common finding of negative return performance at open-end mutual funds is attributable to the costs of liquidity-motivated trading.",['Roger M.

The motivation and impact of pension fund activism,"Pension funds have pursued an active role in corporate governance, although some question their effectiveness and motivations. We examine the impact and motivation of pension fund activism by studying the shareholder proposals of the largest, most active funds from 1987 through 1993. We find significant heterogeneity across funds in activism objectives, tactics, and impact on target firms, consistent with differing investment strategies. We find the funds are more successful at monitoring and promoting change in target firms than previously recognized.

Ex-day behavior with dividend preference and limitations to short-term arbitrage: the case of Swedish lottery bonds,"Swedish lottery bonds offer a unique opportunity to study ex-day effects in an environment where cash distributions are tax-advantaged relative to capital gains. Thus, in the lottery bond market, we observe a reversal of the preference for capital gains that researchers have cited as an explanation for the ex-day behavior of U.S. equities. Further, in this market there are barriers to short-term arbitrage when prices do reflect the tax preferences of individual investors. We find the bonds are priced around the ex-day to reflect differential tax rates on income and capital gains consistent with the prevailing tax regimes. The bonds consistently experience negative returns over the coupon payment period, and in fact often sell at negative yields prior to the cash distribution, as one would expect given tax-motivated trading between high-tax investors, who buy prior to the distribution, and low-tax investors, who buy after the distribution.","['Richard C.

The stock pools and the Securities Exchange Act1,"The stated justification for the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) was to eliminate manipulation. The primary evidence of manipulation was the existence of `stock pools,' through which groups of traders jointly traded in a particular stock. The conclusion of Congress that the pools were manipulative is inconsistent with the evidence produced by the Senate's own investigation. The returns on a sample of pool stocks are also inconsistent with manipulation.

Valuing IPOs,"The use of accounting information in conjunction with comparable firm multiples is widely recommended for valuing initial public offerings (IPOs). We find that the price–earnings (P/E), market-to-book, and price-to-sales multiples of comparable firms have only modest predictive ability without further adjustments. This is largely due to the wide variation of these ratios for young firms within an industry.

The performance of investment newsletters,"This paper analyzes the recommendations of common stocks made by the investment newsletters followed by the Hulbert Financial Digest. We conclude that, taken as a whole, the securities that newsletters recommend do not outperform appropriate benchmarks. Our data provide modest evidence that the future performance of a newsletter is related to its past performance, when performance is measure by raw returns. Evidence of persistence vanishes, however, when performance is measured by abnormal returns. We find little, if any, evidence of herding, i.e., cross-sectional dependence of recommendations, across newsletters.

Does stock price elasticity affect corporate financial decisions?,"This paper considers whether stock price elasticity affects corporate financial decisions. Basic economic principles and the existing theoretical literature predict that firms choosing the Dutch auction instead of the fixed price tender offer should be those firms expecting to face greater stock price elasticity. Econometric analysis suggests that firms choosing the Dutch auction instead of the fixed price tender offer between 1984 and 1989 are indeed those firms expecting to face greater stock elasticity, even though the average realized elasticities of the firms conducting the various tender offers fail to be significantly different. The expected elasticity remains an important determinant of the tender offer choice even when allowing for firm characteristics associated with the choice of repurchase method. Firms facing greater elasticity are also characterized. The findings suggest that expected stock price elasticity may be an important determinant of corporate financial decisions that affect the supply of, or demand for, stock.",['Laurie Simon Hodrick'],"['Repurchases', 'Dutch auctions', 'Fixed price tender offers', 'Elasticity', 'Quasi-maximum likelihood estimation']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000094,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,52,2,Laurie Simon Hodrick,1999,168.20411518019444

This effect is strongest among the lower-rated and smaller debt issues of which banks have underwritten a relatively greater share. The early evidence also indicates that bank entry has tended to decrease market concentration.

Both the likelihood that a retired CEO serves on his own board two years after departure, as well as the likelihood of serving as an outside director on other boards, are positively and strongly related to his performance while CEO. Retention on the CEO's own board depends primarily on stock returns, while service on outside boards is better explained by accounting returns.

Using a sample of more than 400 U.S. mutual funds for 1976–94, our findings suggest that mutual funds behave as highly risk averse, benchmark investors.

The sensitivity of CEO wealth to equity risk: an analysis of the magnitude and determinants,"To control risk-related incentive problems, equity holders are expected to manage both the convexity and slope of the relation between firm performance and managers’ wealth. I find stock options, but not common stockholdings, significantly increase the sensitivity of CEOs’ wealth to equity risk. Cross-sectionally, this sensitivity is positively related to firms’ investment opportunities. This result is consistent with managers receiving incentives to invest in risky projects when the potential loss from underinvestment in valuable risk-increasing projects is greatest. Firms’ stock-return volatility is positively related to the convexity provided to managers, suggesting convex incentive schemes influence investing and financing decisions.",['Wayne R.

While the contract required a 57.8% increase in stock price, it did not motivate managers to create value because the rate of return required to reach $100 in ten years was substantially less than Ralston's cost of equity capital at the time of the contract's adoption. Barring any action by managers that would substantially change the market's expectations about the firm, reaching the $100 hurdle price would be easy.

Long-term returns from equity carveouts1,"Using a sample of 628 carveouts during 1981–1995, this paper finds that the newly issued subsidiary stocks do not underperform appropriate benchmarks over a three-year period following the carveout. This result is in striking contrast with the documented poor performance of initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings. I conjecture that the superior performance of subsidiary stocks arises because the subsidiary and parent firms can focus on fewer business segments after carveout, and because the parent firms continue to own a monitoring position in the subsidiary firms. I test whether the subsidiary stock performance is related to the number of business segments the parent firm has before carveout. The relationship is not always significant, which suggests another possible explanation, that the market may react efficiently to the likely future performance of carveouts.",['Anand M Vijh'],"['Carveouts', 'Divestitures', 'Initial public offerings', 'Long-term returns', 'Seasoned equity offerings']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000531,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,51,2,Anand M Vijh,1999,168.20411518019444

An analysis of value destruction and recovery in the alliance and proposed merger of Volvo and Renault1,"Volvo's attempt to merge with Renault in 1993 temporarily destroyed SEK 8.6 billion (US$ 1.1 billion) in Volvo shareholder wealth. This study traces the destruction to hubris, managerialism, and the escalation of commitment – elements suggested in previous research. In addition, the case suggests path dependence as a source of wealth destruction in mergers. An elaborate structure of cross-shareholdings, joint committees, and a poison pill made it difficult for the strategic allies (Volvo and Renault) to follow any strategic path other than merger if they wanted to exploit economies more fully. Activism by institutional investors was instrumental in halting the destruction of shareholder wealth and redirecting the firm. This study reveals significant positive abnormal returns associated with the institutional activism. Consistent with Shleifer and Vishny (1986), institutional `jawboning' is valuable. An analysis of the voting premium between Volvo's `A' and `B' shares suggests that the value created by institutional voice derived from the strategic change in the firm's direction rather than the power of the coalition of institutional investors to expropriate wealth.",['Robert F Bruner'],"['Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'Alliances', 'Institutional investors', 'Privatization']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000464,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,51,1,Robert F Bruner,1999,168.20411518019444
The long-run performance of stock returns following debt offerings,"We document substantial long-run post-issue underperformance by firms making straight and convertible debt offerings from 1975 to 1989. This long-run underperformance is more severe for smaller, younger, and NASDAQ-listed firms, and for firms issuing speculative grade debt. We also find strong evidence that the underperformance of issuers of both straight and convertible debt is limited to those issues that occur in periods with a high volume of issues. In contrast to earlier event studies that found insignificantly negative abnormal returns at the time of debt issue announcements and concluded that debt offerings had no impact on shareholder wealth, our results suggest that debt offerings, like equity offerings, are signals that the firm is overvalued. As with equity offerings and repurchases, the market appears to underreact at the time of the debt offering announcement so that the full impact of the offering is only realized over a longer time horizon.","['D.Katherine Spiess', 'John Affleck-Graves']","['Debt offerings', 'Underperformance']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000318,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,54,1,D.Katherine Spiess,1999,168.20411518019444
"Information asymmetry, valuation, and the corporate spin-off decision","We empirically analyze the information hypothesis that the separation of a firm's divisions into independently traded units through a spin-off enhances value because it mitigates information asymmetry about the firm. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that firms that engage in spin-offs have higher levels of information asymmetry compared to their industry and size matched counterparts and the information problems decrease significantly after the spin-off. The gains around spin-offs are positively related to the degree of information asymmetry, and this relation is more pronounced for firms with fewer negative synergies between divisions. Finally, firms with higher growth opportunities and firms in need of external capital show a higher propensity to engage in spin-offs. They also raise more capital following a spin-off, which is consistent with the view that these firms mitigate information asymmetry before approaching the capital market for funds.","['Sudha Krishnaswami', 'Venkat Subramaniam']","['Spin-offs', 'Divestitures', 'Information asymmetry']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000173,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,53,1,Sudha Krishnaswami,1999,168.20411518019444

"Institutions, financial markets, and firm debt maturity","We examine firm debt maturity in 30 countries during the period 1980–1991. In countries with active stock markets, large firms have more long-term debt. Stock market activity is not correlated with debt levels of small firms. By contrast, in countries with a large banking sector, small firms have less short-term debt and their debt is of longer maturity. Variation in the size of the banking sector is uncorrelated with the capital structures of large firms. Government subsidies to industry are positively related and inflation is negatively related to the use of long-term debt. We also find evidence of maturity matching.","['Asli Demirgüç-Kunt', 'Vojislav Maksimovic']","['Capital structure', 'Debt maturity', 'Financial institutions', 'Legal system']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000392,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,54,3,Asli Demirgüç-Kunt,1999,168.20411518019444
How are stock prices affected by the location of trade?,"We examine pairs of large, `Siamese twin’ companies whose stocks are traded around the world but have different trading and ownership habitats. Twins pool their cash flows, so, with integrated markets, twin stocks should move together. However, the difference between the prices of twin stocks appears to be correlated with the markets on which they are traded most, i.e., a twin's relative price rises when the market on which it is traded relatively intensively rises. We examine several explanations of this phenomenon including: the discretionary use of dividend income by parent companies: differences in parent expenditures; voting rights; currency fluctuations; ex-dividend date timing issues; and tax-induced investor heterogeneity. Only the last hypothesis can explain some, but not all, of the empirical facts. We conjecture that: (a) country-specific sentiment shocks might affect share intensity, (b) investors are rational, but markets are segmented by frictions other than international transactions costs, such as agency problems.","['Kenneth A.

The determinants and implications of corporate cash holdings,"We examine the determinants and implications of holdings of cash and marketable securities by publicly traded U.S. firms in the 1971–1994 period. In time-series and cross-section tests, we find evidence supportive of a static tradeoff model of cash holdings. In particular, firms with strong growth opportunities and riskier cash flows hold relatively high ratios of cash to total non-cash assets. Firms that have the greatest access to the capital markets, such as large firms and those with high credit ratings, tend to hold lower ratios of cash to total non-cash assets. At the same time, however, we find evidence that firms that do well tend to accumulate more cash than predicted by the static tradeoff model where managers maximize shareholder wealth. There is little evidence that excess cash has a large short-run impact on capital expenditures, acquisition spending, and payouts to shareholders. The main reason that firms experience large changes in excess cash is the occurrence of operating losses.","['Tim Opler', 'Lee Pinkowitz', 'René Stulz', 'Rohan Williamson']",[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000033,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,52,1,Tim Opler,1999,168.20411518019444
Ownership and board structures in publicly traded corporations,"We examine the equity ownership structure and board composition of a sample of 583 firms over the ten-year period 1983–1992. Our evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of firms exhibit large changes in ownership and board structure in any given year. These changes are correlated with one another and are not reversed in subsequent years. Ownership and board changes are strongly related to top executive turnover, prior stock price performance, and corporate control threats, but only weakly related to changes in firm-specific determinants of ownership and board structure. Furthermore, large ownership changes are typically preceded by economic shocks and followed by asset restructurings.","['David J Denis', 'Atulya Sarin']","['Ownership structure', 'Board composition']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000082,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,52,2,David J Denis,1999,168.20411518019444
Measuring investment distortions arising from stockholder–bondholder conflicts,We examine the importance of stockholder–bondholder conflicts in capital-structure choice. Numerical techniques are used to compute the expected wealth transfer between stockholders and bondholders when a firm adopts a new project. We characterize the set of positive NPV projects that stockholders prefer to ignore and the set of negative NPV projects that stockholders want to accept. The results illustrate how these distortions vary with firm and project characteristics. We also estimate the impact of stockholder–bondholder conflicts on investment decisions for 23 different firms and examine the extent to which stockholder-bondholder conflicts explain observed cross-sectional variation in capital structures.,"['Robert Parrino', 'Michael S Weisbach']","['Capital structure', 'Stockholder–bondholder conflicts', 'Underinvestment', 'Asset substitution', 'Monte-Carlo simulations']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X9900015X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,53,1,Robert Parrino,1999,168.20411518019444
Capital gains tax rates and the cost of capital for small business: evidence from the IPO market,"We examine the issue prices of small initial public offerings around the 1993 tax law change that reduced the capital gains tax on qualified small business stock. We compare the actual issue price of new stock with a benchmark price that is not affected by the change in capital gains tax. We find that, after controlling for IPO underpricing, the issue prices of qualifying small business stock after the tax rate change are significantly higher than the issue prices before the change. A control sample of nonqualifying firms shows no significant difference in issue prices.","['David A.

Transaction costs and predictability: some utility cost calculations,"We examine the loss in utility for a consumer who ignores any or all of the following: (1) the multi-period nature of the consumer's portfolio-choice problem, (2) the empirically documented predictability of asset returns, or (3) transaction costs. Both the costs of behaving myopically and ignoring predictability can be substantial, although allowing for intermediate consumption reduces these costs. Ignoring realistic transaction costs (fixed and proportional) imposes significant utility costs that range from 0.8% up to 16.9% of wealth. For the scenarios that we consider, the presence of transaction costs always increases the utility cost of behaving myopically, but decreases the utility cost of ignoring predictability.","['Pierluigi Balduzzi', 'Anthony W Lynch']","['Portfolio choice', 'Transaction costs', 'Return predictability', 'Utility cost']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000045,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,52,1,Pierluigi Balduzzi,1999,168.20411518019444
Limit orders and the bid–ask spread,"We examine the role of limit-order traders and specialists in the market-making process. We find that a large portion of posted bid–ask quotes originates from the limit-order book without direct participation by specialists, and that competition between traders and specialists has a significant impact on the bid–ask spread. Specialists’ spreads are widest at the open, narrow until late morning, and then level off. The U-shaped intraday pattern of spreads largely reflects the intraday variation in spreads established by limit-order traders. Lastly, the intraday variation in limit-order spreads is significantly related to the intraday variation in limit-order placements and executions.","['Kee H Chung', 'Bonnie F Van Ness', 'Robert A Van Ness']","['Limit order', 'Bid–ask spread', 'Specialists']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000227,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,53,2,Kee H Chung,1999,168.20411518019444
An analysis of contagion and competitive effects at commercial banks,"We examine whether an adverse event at one bank generates externalities for the banking industry, and assess whether the population of commercial banks is homogeneous. We find dividend reductions are negative events for both announcing money center and regional banks, but only reductions at money center banks have negative, contagion-type externalities. Dividend reductions at regional banks have positive competitive effects on geographic rivals. Regulatory enforcement actions induce negative valuation effects that are idiosyncratic to targeted banks, but actions against regional banks generate positive competitive effects on geographic rivals. Our evidence suggests that regional banking markets are not contestable.","['Myron B. Slovin', 'Marie E. Sushka', 'John A.

Firm performance and focus: long-run stock market performance following spinoffs,"We examine whether an increase in focus is an explanation for the stock market gains associated with spinoffs. For a sample of 155 spinoffs between the years 1975 and 1991, we find that the announcement period as well the long-run abnormal returns for the focus-increasing spinoffs are significantly larger than the corresponding abnormal returns for the non-focus-increasing spinoffs. The results for the change in operating performance are consistent with those for the stock market performance. Cross-sectionally, the stock market performance as well as the operating performance are positively associated with change in focus. An analysis of the non-focus-increasing spinoffs shows that the firms are likely to undertake these spinoffs to separate underperforming subsidiaries from the parents.","['Hemang Desai', 'Prem C.

Using a sample of first public straight debt offers, we test the cross-monitoring effect of bank debt and Diamond's (1991, Journal of Political Economy, 99, 689–721) reputation-building argument. We find that the existence of bank debt lowers the at-issue yield spreads for first public straight bond offers by about 68 basis points, on average. Consistent with Diamond's reputation-building argument, we document that firm reputation is negatively related to the at-issue yield spread for initial public debt offers.","['Sudip Datta', 'Mai Iskandar-Datta', 'Ajay Patel']","['Bank cross-monitoring', 'Public debt pricing', 'Debt reputation', 'Yield spreads', 'Bond IPOs']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000609,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,51,3,Sudip Datta,1999,168.20411518019444

We also find that the predicted component of compensation arising from these characteristics of board and ownership structure has a statistically significant negative relation with subsequent firm operating and stock return performance.

The impact of cash flow volatility on discretionary investment and the costs of debt and equity financing,"We show that higher cash flow volatility is associated with lower average levels of investment in capital expenditures, R&D, and advertising. This association suggests that firms do not use external capital markets to fully cover cash flow shortfalls but rather permanently forgo investment. Cash flow volatility also is associated with higher costs of accessing external capital. Moreover, these higher costs, as measured by some proxies, imply a greater sensitivity of investment to cash flow volatility. Thus, cash flow volatility not only increases the likelihood that a firm will need to access capital markets, it also increases the costs of doing so.","['Bernadette A.

Survivorship bias and attrition effects in measures of performance persistence,"We simulate standard tests of performance persistence using alternative return-generating processes, survival criteria, and test methodologies. When survival depends on performance over several periods, survivorship bias induces spurious reversals, despite the presence of cross-sectional heteroskedasticity in performance. Look-ahead biased methodologies and missing final returns typical of U.S. mutual fund datasets can also materially affect persistence measures. Our results reinforce previous findings that U.S. mutual fund performance is truly persistent. When fund performance is truly persistent, fund attrition affects persistence measures, even when the sample includes all nonsurvivor returns. We also examine the specification and power of the various persistence tests.","['Jennifer N. Carpenter', 'Anthony W.

Using genetic algorithms to find technical trading rules1,"We use a genetic algorithm to learn technical trading rules for the S&P 500 index using daily prices from 1928 to 1995. After transaction costs, the rules do not earn consistent excess returns over a simple buy-and-hold strategy in the out-of-sample test periods. The rules are able to identify periods to be in the index when daily returns are positive and volatility is low and out when the reverse is true. These latter results can largely be explained by low-order serial correlation in stock index returns.","['Franklin Allen', 'Risto Karjalainen']","['Trading rules', 'Genetic algorithms', 'Excess returns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X9800052X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.5239723673496386,51,2,Franklin Allen,1999,168.20411518019444

Predictive regressions,"When a rate of return is regressed on a lagged stochastic regressor, such as a dividend yield, the regression disturbance is correlated with the regressor's innovation. The OLS estimator's finite-sample properties, derived here, can depart substantially from the standard regression setting. Bayesian posterior distributions for the regression parameters are obtained under specifications that differ with respect to (i) prior beliefs about the autocorrelation of the regressor and (ii) whether the initial observation of the regressor is specified as fixed or stochastic.

Managerial compensation and the threat of takeover,"A greater threat of takeover has two opposing effects on managerial compensation. The competition effect in the market for managers reduces compensation. The risk effect increases compensation by making managers' implicitly deferred compensation and firm-specific human capital less secure. Using a sample of about 450 large firms, we find that an increase in the threat of takeover from the first to the third quartile reduces a typical CEO's salary and bonus by $22,800–211,600 due to the competition effect, but raises salary and bonus by $41,500–255,300 due to the risk effect. The net effect is an increase of $18,700–43,700.","['Anup Agrawal', 'Charles R.

Capital budgeting and delegation1,"As part of our ongoing research into capital budgeting processes as responses to decentralized information and incentive problems, we focus in this paper on when a level of a managerial hierarchy will delegate the allocation of capital across projects and time to the level below it. In our model, delegation is a way to save on costly investigation of proposed projects. Therefore, it is more extensive the larger are the costs of such investigations. This delegation takes advantage of the fact that the lower-level manager's preferences are assumed to be similar (though not identical) to those of the higher level.","['Milton Harris', 'Artur Raviv']","['Capital budgeting', 'Delegation', 'Budget rollovers']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000385,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,50,3,Milton Harris,1998,168.11997105053953
Open-end mutual funds and capital-gains taxes1,"Despite the fact that taxable investors would prefer to defer the realization of capital gains indefinitely, most open-end mutual funds regularly realize and distribute a large portion of their gains.

In equilibrium, managers interested in attracting new investors pass through taxable capital gains to reduce the overhang of unrealized gains.

Debt and the terms of employment1,"For the last two decades, firms with higher debt have reduced their employment more often, used more part time and seasonal employees, paid lower wages, and funded pension plans less generously. These effects are economically significant and cannot be explained by variation in performance. Thus debt seems to discipline the employment relationship. However, this result reflects a clear historical reversal, during the years 1967–73, of the opposite effect that prevailed in the 1950s.

The impact of contingent liability on commercial bank risk taking,"From 1863–1935, regulators imposed contingent liability on bank shareholders to discourage risk taking. Using data from 1900 to 1915, I find that banks subject to stricter liability rules have lower equity and asset volatility, hold a lower proportion of risky assets, and are less likely to increase their investment in risky assets when their net worth declines, consistent with the hypothesis that stricter liability discourages commercial bank risk taking. These findings provide lessons for current bank regulatory policy and show that the shape of the residual claimant's payoff function has a significant impact on managerial incentives and firm performance.",['Benjamin C.

An optimal strategy for going public starts with the IPO, which is particularly suited for the sale of dispersed holdings to small and passive investors.

The exercise and valuation of executive stock options1,"In theory, hedging restrictions faced by managers make executive stock options more difficult to value than ordinary options, because they imply that exercise policies of managers depend on their preferences and endowments. Using data on option exercises from 40 firms, this paper shows that a simple extension of the ordinary American option model which introduces random, exogenous exercise and forfeiture predicts actual exercise times and payoffs just as well as an elaborate utility-maximizing model that explicitly accounts for the nontransferability of options. The simpler model could therefore be more useful than the preference-based model for valuing executive options in practice.",['Jennifer N.

Share repurchases and firm performance:,"In this paper we examine tender offer share repurchases to differentiate between the information signaling and free cash flow hypotheses. Previous work in this area has focused on announcement period returns. While we also examine announcement returns, our primary emphasis is on operating performance changes surrounding repurchases. We argue that the information contained in changes in operating performance, and its determinants, enables us to differentiate between the two hypotheses. Our primary finding is that operating performance following repurchases improves only in low-growth firms, and that these gains are generated by more efficient utilization of assets, and asset sales, rather than improved growth opportunities. Thus, repurchases do not appear to be pure financial transactions meant to change the firm's capital structure but are part of a restructuring package meant to shrink the assets of the firm. This evidence leads us to conclude that the positive investor reaction to repurchases is best explained by the free cash flow hypothesis.","['Tom Nohel', 'Vefa Tarhan']","['Share repurchases', 'Free cash flow', 'Signaling', 'Restructuring']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000221,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,49,2,Tom Nohel,1998,168.11997105053953
Why do stock prices drop by less than the value of the dividend?

This has commonly been attributed to the effect of tax clienteles. We examine data from the Hong Kong stock market, where neither dividends nor capital gains are taxed. As in the U.S., the average stock price drop is less than the value of the dividend; specifically, the average dividend for the period 1980–1993 is HK $0.12 and the average price drop is HK $0.06.

Ancient redwoods and the politics of finance: The hostile takeover of the Pacific Lumber Company,"Pacific Lumber was acquired in 1986 by MAXXAM, whose decision to double PL's harvest of old-growth redwoods precipitated 11 years of environmental protests. Intense media coverage blames the Drexel-financed takeover for threatening Headwaters Forest, the largest privately owned ancient redwood forest. This ‘Wall Street greed’ portrayal aroused such public outrage that the Clinton administration agreed to pay $380 million for Headwaters weeks before the 1996 election. We establish that the threat to Head-waters is not attributable to MAXXAM's junk bond-financed takeover. Government's response to dramatic crises encourages interest groups to use emotional appeals to influence resource allocation.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo']","['Takeovers', 'Junk bonds', 'Politics of finance', 'Environmental economics']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000366,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,47,1,Harry DeAngelo,1998,168.11997105053953
The relation between implied and realized volatility1,"Previous research finds the volatility implied by S&P 100 index option prices to be a biased and inefficient forecast of future volatility and to contain little or no incremental information beyond that in past realized volatility. In contrast, we find that implied volatility outperforms past volatility in forecasting future volatility and even subsumes the information content of past volatility in some of our specifications. Our results differ from previous studies because we use longer time series and nonoverlapping data. A regime shift around the October 1987 crash explains why implied volatility is more biased in previous work.","['B.J. Christensen', 'N.R.

The effect of changes in ownership structure on performance: Evidence from the thrift industry1,"Restrictions on stock ownership may harm a company's performance, because restrictions prevent owners from choosing an optimal structure. We examine the stock-price performance and ownership structure of a sample of thrift institutions that converted from mutual to stock ownership. We find that after conversion and the expiration of ownership-structure restrictions, firm performance improves significantly, and the portions of the firm owned by managers and the firm's employee stock ownership plan increase.

Interestingly, the relation between discretionary current accruals and future returns (adjusted for firm size and book-to-market ratio) is stronger and more persistent for seasoned equity issuers than for non-issuers.

Ex dividend day stock price behavior: discreteness or tax-induced clienteles?,"Since prices are constrained to discrete tick multiples while dividends are essentially continuous, ex day price changes will not equal dividends. We argue that the expected price drop is strictly less than the dividend but within one tick of the dividend. The price-drop-to-dividend ratio will (i) be less than one, (ii) increase with dividends generally, and (iii) decline between tick multiples, giving a sawtooth pattern in the data. Since dividends and dividend yields are highly correlated, discreteness will give the impression of tax-induced dividend clienteles even if there are none.

The DJIA book-to-market ratio contains information about future returns that is not captured by other variables such as interest yield spreads and dividend yields. The DJIA book-to-market ratio's predictive ability is specific to the pre-1960 sample. In contrast, the S&P book-to-market ratio provides some predictive ability in the post-1960 period, although this relation is dramatically weaker than the Dow Jones pre-1960 findings.

Venture capital and the structure of capital markets: banks versus stock markets1,"The United States has many banks that are small relative to large corporations and play a limited role in corporate governance, and a well developed stock market with an associated market for corporate control. In contrast, Japanese and German banks are fewer in number but larger in relative size and are said to play a central governance role. Neither country has an active market for corporate control. We extend the debate on the relative efficiency of bank- and stock market-centered capital markets by developing a further systematic difference between the two systems: the greater vitality of venture capital in stock market-centered systems. Understanding the link between the stock market and the venture capital market requires understanding the contractual arrangements between entrepreneurs and venture capital providers; especially, the importance of the opportunity to enter into an implicit contract over control, which gives a successful entrepreneur the option to reacquire control from the venture capitalist by using an initial public offering as the means by which the venture capitalist exits from a portfolio investment. We also extend the literature on venture capital contracting by offering an explanation for two central characteristics of the U.S. venture capital market: relatively rapid exit by venture capital providers from investments in portfolio companies; and the common practice of exit through an initial public offering.","['Bernard S Black', 'Ronald J Gilson']","['Venture Capital', 'Exit Strategy', 'IPO', 'Comparative corporate governance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000457,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,47,3,Bernard S Black,1998,168.11997105053953

We examine amortized spreads for Amex and NYSE stocks over the period 1983–1992. We find that stocks with similar spreads can have vastly different share turnover, and thus, a stock's amortized spread cannot be predicted reliably by its spread alone.

We focus on the agency problem that results when large institutions are the only investors capable of monitoring the firm whereas small shareholders free-ride on these activities. The major conclusion is that some well-known aspects of IPOs may be explained as rational responses by the issuer to the existence of regulatory constraints in public capital markets. There is a two-stage offering mechanism in which the investment banker, acting in the interests of the issuer, optimally rations the allotment of shares to small investors in order to capture the benefits associated with better monitoring by institutions. Importantly, in our model, the existence of underpricing (and oversubscription) is an indication that the issuer has received a higher ex ante price than would have been obtained through a competitive Walrasian-type offering process.","['Neal M Stoughton', 'Josef Zechner']","['IPOs', 'Monitoring', 'Institutions', 'Underwriting']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000178,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,49,1,Neal M Stoughton,1998,168.11997105053953
Why firms issue convertible bonds: The matching of financial and real investment options,"This paper contends that corporations use callable, convertible bonds to lower the issuance costs of sequential financing. Sequential financing increases issue costs but helps control overinvestment incentives that can arise if financing is provided prior to an investment option's maturity. A convertible bond's conversion option reduces issue costs while helping to control the overinvestment incentive. Evidence of important investment and financing activity around the time convertible bonds are called and converted supports the hypothesis.

An empirical analysis of NYSE specialist trading1,"This paper examines empirically the magnitude and determinants of dealer trading by NYSE market makers (specialists) across stocks and over time. Across stocks, specialist dealer trading varies widely and is inversely related to trading volume and proxies for off-exchange competition. Over time in an individual stock, specialists participate more actively as sellers (buyers) when holding long (short) inventory positions. This results suggest that dealers control their inventory positions by selectively timing the size and direction of their trades rather than by adjusting their quotes. Further, specialists participate more in smaller trades and when the bid–ask spread is wide.","['Ananth Madhavan', 'George Sofianos']","['NYSE specialists', 'Bid–ask spreads', 'Dealer trading', 'Market makers']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000087,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,48,2,Ananth Madhavan,1998,168.11997105053953

"Employee buyouts: causes, structure, and consequences1","This paper investigates the motivations for and consequences of including a broad group of employees in leveraged buyouts by comparing employee buyouts (EBOs) to transactions where only top level managers participate, or management buyouts (MBOs). We examine the implications of including employees in a buyout from a labor contracting, financing, and management control point of view. A major finding is that employee participation helps to finance the buyout. The EBO allows firms to gain access to excess pension assets by converting employees' defined benefit pension capital into equity claims, thus freeing the excess assets in the pension plan to help fund the buyout. Also, employee participation substitutes equity claims for cash labor compensation costs and therefore allows the firm to borrow more than otherwise would be possible. There is also evidence consistent with managers including employees to maintain or enhance incumbent management's control.","['Susan Chaplinsky', 'Greg Niehaus', 'Linda Van de Gucht']","['ESOP', 'LBO', 'Employee ownership', 'Labor contracts']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000130,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,48,3,Susan Chaplinsky,1998,168.11997105053953

Using a new database, the Dow Jones World Stock Index, with coverage in 25 countries and over 66 industry classifications, we decompose comprehensively both country and industrial sources of variation. We confirm that little of the variation in country index returns can be explained by their industrial composition.

However, the long-term underperformance of acquiring firms in mergers is predominantly caused by the poor post-acquisition performance of low book-to-market “glamour” firms.

Does order preferencing matter?1,"This study examines how order preferencing affects the competitiveness and efficiency of laboratory financial markets. We operationalize preferencing by allowing some dealers to execute a portion of the order flow by matching the most favorable quotes available. Increasing the proportion of order flow that is preferenced can increase bid–ask spreads, reduce the informational efficiency of prices, and benefit dealers at the expense of liquidity traders. Preferencing has none of these effects, however, when two or more dealers are not receiving preferencing orders.

Firms with more outside board members, smaller market-to-book ratios, and attempts by outsiders to gain control are more likely to be liquidated. Although few top executives of liquidating firms subsequently take comparable jobs, at least 41% of CEOs who downsize are made better off by liquidation.","['Hamid Mehran', 'George E.

Targeted underwriters experience large declines in IPO market share and increased regulatory scrutiny and client risk after an SEC investigation is announced. Stock prices of clients decline significantly. We attribute these effects to a sudden deterioration in the value of the underwriter's reputation capital, suggesting that the general assumption in prior IPO research that underwriter reputation is stationary may be inappropriate. Our results also suggest that the SEC's power to institute investigations should be considered when designing optimal securities regulation.","['Randolph P Beatty', 'Howard Bunsis', 'John R.M Hand']","['Underwriter reputation', 'SEC investigations', 'Indirect penalties', 'Optimal regulation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X9800035X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,50,2,Randolph P Beatty,1998,168.11997105053953

The evidence also indicates that, with the exception of the U.S. equity market, the premium for bearing currency risk often represents a significant fraction of the total premium.","['Giorgio De Santis', 'Bruno Gérard']","['International asset pricing', 'Currency risk', 'Multivariate GARCH']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000294,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,49,3,Giorgio De Santis,1998,168.11997105053953
The economics of parent-subsidiary mergers:,"We examine parent-subsidiary mergers, transactions that do not entail arm's length bargaining or a change in control. These mergers are typically followed by considerable restructuring of subsidiaries. Minority and parent returns are not significantly different from returns at third party buyouts of parent-controlled subsidiaries, transactions that entail arm's length negotiations and a change in control. Buyer returns are negative, consistent with overbidding. We conclude that parent-subsidiary mergers facilitate corporate restructuring, foster the reallocation of resources toward higher valued uses, and increase value for both parent and subsidiary.","['Myron B.

The effects of bank mergers and acquisitions on small business lending1,"We examine the effects of bank M&As on small business lending using data on over 6000 recent U.S. bank M&As. We are the first to decompose the impact of M&As into the static effects from simply melding the antecedent institutions and the dynamic effects associated with post-M&A refocusing of the consolidated institution. We are also the first to estimate the dynamic reactions of other local banks. We find that the static effects of consolidation reduce small business lending, but are mostly offset by the reactions of other banks, and in some cases also by refocusing efforts of the consolidating institutions themselves.","['Allen N Berger', 'Anthony Saunders', 'Joseph M Scalise', 'Gregory F Udell']","['Bank', 'Mergers', 'Small business']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000361,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,50,2,Allen N Berger,1998,168.11997105053953
Macroeconomic news and bond market volatility1,"We examine the reaction of daily Treasury bond prices to the release of U.S. macroeconomic news. These news releases (of employment and producer price index data) are of interest because they are released on periodic, preannounced dates and because they are associated with substantial bond market volatility. We investigate whether these nonautocorrelated announcements give rise to autocorrelated volatility. We find that announcement-day volatility does not persist at all, consistent with the immediate incorporation of information into prices. We also find a risk premium on these release dates.","['Charles M. Jones', 'Owen Lamont', 'Robin L.

"Alternative factor specifications, security characteristics, and the cross-section of expected stock returns1","We examine the relation between stock returns, measures of risk, and several non-risk security characteristics, including the book-to-market ratio, firm size, the stock price, the dividend yield, and lagged returns. Our primary objective is to determine whether non-risk characteristics have marginal explanatory power relative to the arbitrage pricing theory benchmark, with factors determined using, in turn, the Connor and Korajczyk (CK; 1988) and the Fama and French (FF; 1993b) approaches. Fama–MacBeth-type regressions using risk adjusted returns provide evidence of return momentum, size, and book-to-market effects, together with a significant and negative relation between returns and trading volume, even after accounting for the CK factors. When the analysis is repeated using the FF factors, we find that the size and book-to-market effects are attenuated, while the momentum and trading volume effects persist. In addition, Nasdaq stocks show significant underperformance after adjusting for risk using either method.","['Michael J.

Wealth creation versus wealth redistributions in pure stock-for-stock mergers1,"We examine wealth changes for all 1283 publicly traded debt and equity securities of firms involved in 260 pure stock-for-stock mergers from 1963 to 1996. We find no evidence that conglomerate stock-for-stock mergers create financial synergies or benefit bondholders at stockholders' expense. Instead, we document significant net synergistic gains in nonconglomerate mergers and generally insignificant net gains in conglomerate mergers. Conglomerate bidding-firm stockholders lose; all other securityholders at least break even. Convertible securityholders experience the largest gains, due mostly to their attached option values. Certain bond covenants are value-enhancing while leverage increases are value-reducing.","['Carlos P Maquieira', 'William L Megginson', 'Lance Nail']","['Conglomerate mergers', 'Stock-for-stock mergers', 'Bond valuation']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000026,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,48,1,Carlos P Maquieira,1998,168.11997105053953
"Information and volatility linkages in the stock, bond, and money markets1","We investigate the nature of volatility linkages in the stock, bond, and money markets. We develop a simple model of speculative trading that predicts strong volatility linkages in these markets due to common information, which simultaneously affects expectations across markets, and information spillover caused by cross-market hedging. To measure these linkages, we estimate a stochastic volatility representation of our trading model using GMM. The results indicate that our specification explains many of the observed characteristics of the data, and that the volatility linkages between the three markets are indeed strong. Moreover, we find that the linkages have become stronger since the 1987 stock market crash.","['Jeff Fleming', 'Chris Kirby', 'Barbara Ostdiek']","['Stochastic volatility', 'Common information', 'Information spillover', 'Market linkages']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000191,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,49,1,Jeff Fleming,1998,168.11997105053953
The cost of market versus regulatory discipline in banking1,"We present evidence that insured deposit financing shields banks from the full costs of market discipline. Moody's downgrades, indicators of increasing risk, are associated with negative abnormal equity returns that are increasing in the bank's reliance on insured deposits.

These findings cast doubt on the ability of capital market participants to effectively discipline bank behavior within the current regulatory environment. More generally, our findings highlight the potential for regulation to undermine market discipline in regulated industries.","['Matthew T. Billett', 'Jon A. Garfinkel', ""Edward S.

We find that proxy contests create value, with the bulk of the wealth gains stemming from firms that are acquired. Restricting analysis to firms listed on Compustat imparts a downward bias on estimated wealth effects because such a restriction excludes a sizable fraction of the firms acquired during the proxy contest. For firms that are not acquired, the occurrence of management turnover has a significant, positive effect on shareholder wealth because firms replacing management are more likely to restructure following the contest.","['J.Harold Mulherin', 'Annette B Poulsen']","['Proxy contests', 'Market for corporate control', 'Management Turnover', 'Corporate restructuring']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000469,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6081306519596058,47,3,J.Harold Mulherin,1998,168.11997105053953

Nasdaq market structure and spread patterns,"Because of its institutional features, the Nasdaq market does not fit the standard competitive model. We construct a model that reflects the distinguishing characteristics of the Nasdaq market.

Using this result, we provide an explanation for the odd-eighth avoidance documented in Christie and Schultz (1994). We show that market-makers can use odd-tick avoidance as a coordination device to increase spreads. Evidence from Nasdaq supports our hypotheses.","['Eugene Kandel', 'Leslie M.

Moreover Information transfer or ‘contagion’ effects are present in that LLR announcements by regional banks decrease the value of both money-center banks and nonannouncing regional banks.

Bounds on contingent claims based on several assets,"In 1987, Lo derived an upper bound on the price of a European call option on a single asset. Lo's bound depends only on the mean and variance of the terminal asset price and is termed a semi-parametric bound. This paper derives similar semi-parametric bounds on a European call on the maximum of any number of assets. A distribution-free bound for the price of this option is obtained. The bound depends only on the means and covariance matrix of the returns on n underlying assets. The bound is obtained by optimizing over the entries of a positive definite matrix A. This can be accomplished by a technique known as semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the methodology using two specific applications. The first concerns the valuation of a European call option on the maximum of several assets. This is known as an outperformance option and is of some practical interest. The second application concerns the valuation of a discretely adjusted lookback option.

We find that share demand is related to proxies for agency costs and the expected costs of financial distress.

Capital market frictions and the role of internal capital markets in banking,"The extent to which banking firms face external financing costs when funding new loans has important implications for the role of banks in the corporate capital acquisition process, for the effectiveness of monetary policy and for the impact of capital requirements. We investigate this issue by examining the cash-flow sensitivity of loan growth at bank holding companies, and by examining the extent to which holding companies establish an internal capital market to allocate capital among their various subsidiaries. Overall, we find that loan growth at subsidiary banks is more sensitive to the holding company's cash flow and capital position than to the bank's own cash flow and capital. Moreover, we find that bank loan growth is negatively correlated with loan growth among the other subsidiaries within the holding company.

Corporate restructuring during performance declines in Japan,"This paper documents the restructuring of 92 Japanese corporations that experienced a substantial decline in operating performance between 1986 and 1990. These firms implement a number of downsizing measures such as asset sales, plant closures, and employee layoffs. Firms also expand and diversify, and often restructure their internal operations. Compared to US firms with a similar decline in performance, however, Japanese firms are less likely to downsize, and layoffs affect a smaller fraction of their workforce.

Bid-ask spreads and the avoidance of odd-eighth quotes on Nasdaq: An examination of exchange listings,"This paper examines 472 securities that were listed on Nasdaq and moved to the NYSE or Amex. When Nasdaq market makers avoid odd-eighth quotes, bid-ask spreads are large and decline dramatically with exchange listing. When market makers use both odd and even eighths, spreads are smaller and decline only slightly with exchange listing. The large spreads observed when Nasdaq market makers avoid odd-eighths cannot be explained by security-specific characteristics. Instead, the results support the conclusion that the avoidance of odd-eighth quotes is used as a coordination device among Nasdaq market makers to maintain supra-competitive bid-ask spreads.",['Michael J.

Guaranty funds and risk-taking evidence from the insurance industry,"This paper examines change in property-liability insurers' risk-taking around enactments of state guaranty fund laws. Our evidence suggests that the risk of insurers' asset portfolios increases following enactments. But this increase in risk is significant only for stock insurers. Our evidence of increased risk-taking following guaranty-fund adoptions suggests that the way these funds are organized creates counterproductive investment incentives, especially for stock companies. Because these laws were enacted by states over the period 1969–1981, our evidence on changes in risk-taking helps resolve statistical problems that have been troublesome for studies of bank deposit insurance.","['Soon-Jae Lee', 'David Mayers', 'Clifford W.

Spinoffs and wealth transfers: The Marriott case,"This paper examines changes in bondholder and shareholder wealth resulting from the 1993 Marriott spinoff. It documents a wealth transfer from bondholders to shareholders and a decline in the total value of the firm following the spinoff announcement. Subsequent modifications to the spinoff plan reduced the bondholders' loss, but the value of Marriott's notes and debentures remained $194.6 million below their pre-announcement level on the distribution date. Industry-adjusted shareholder gains during the same period were only $80.6 million.

Returns to contrarian investment strategies: Tests of naive expectations hypotheses,"This paper examines the ability of naive investor expectations models to explain the higher returns to contrarian investment strategies. Contrary to Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), we find no systematic evidence that stock prices reflect naive extrapolation of past trends in earnings and sales growth. Building on Bauman and Dowen (1988) and La Porta (1995), however, we find that stock prices appear to naively reflect analysts' biased forecasts of future earnings growth. Further, we find that naive reliance on analysts' forecasts of future earnings growth can explain over half of the higher returns to contrarian investment strategies.","['Patricia M.

An alternative valuation model for contingent claims,"This paper studies contingent claim valuation in a Lucas-type exchange economy. The derived fundamental valuation equation differs from its Cox-Ingersoll-Ross production-economy counterpart in that it is expressed in terms of the direct utility function and an exogenous output process, thus offering superior tractability. We apply our approach to derive closed-form solutions for bond, bond option, individual stock, and stock option prices, under a more general setting than allowable in the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross framework. The resulting interest rate and stock price dynamics are empirically plausible. Moreover, our stock option pricing formula with stochastic volatility and interest rates can reconcile certain puzzling empirical regularities, including the volatility smile.","['Gurdip S.

We document that foreign investors hold disproportionately more shares of firms in manufacturing industries, large firms, and firms with good accounting performance, low unsystematic risk, and low leverage. Controlling for size, there is evidence that small firms that export more firms with greater share turnover, and firms that have ADRs have greater foreign ownership.","['Jun-Koo Kang', 'Rene´M.

We find that, beginning in August 1993, the estimated option value was persistently negative on nearly every day for the ensuing eight months. We show that the anomalous pricing behavior arose because the underlying callable bond became the cheapest to deliver issue against U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts.

On biases in tests of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates,We document extreme bias and dispersion in the small-sample distributions of four standard regression-based tests of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates. The biases arise because of the extreme persistence in short interest rates. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the biases under a simple first-order autoregressive data generating process for the short rate. We then conduct Monte Carlo experiments based on a bias-adjusted first-order autoregressive process for the short rate and for a more realistic bias-adjusted VAR-GARCH model incorporating the short rate and three term spreads. Conducting inference with the small-sample distributions of test statistics rather than with their asymptotic distributions provides a more consistent rejection of the expectations hypothesis.

Our results also hold for subsamples partitioned by industry and issue year. On average, investors are not adequately compensated for this additional mortality risk, earning lower risk-adjusted rates of return on portfolios of lower-priced shares than on portfolios of higher-priced shares.","['P.J.

We find that effective bid-ask spreads are only slightly smaller at the NYSE. However, realized bid-ask spreads, which measure market-making revenue net of losses to betterinformed traders but gross of inventory or order-processing costs, are lower on the NYSE by a factor of two to three. This differential is attributable to the successful ‘cream skimming’ of uninformed trades by off-NYSE market makers.

These and other cross-sectional results are consistent with the asymmetric information framework of Eckbo and Masulis (1992) and help resolve the longstanding rights offer paradox.","['Øyvind Bøhren', 'B.

Executive stock ownership and performance tracking faint traces,"We examine the relation between managers' financial interests and firm performance. Since the relation could go in either direction, we cast the analysis in a simultaneous equations framework. For firms involved in acquisitions, we find that acquisition performance and Tobin's Q ratios affect the size of managers' stockholdings. We find no evidence, however, that larger stockholdings lead to better performance. Perhaps management is effectively disciplined by competition in product and labor markets. Alternatively, it may not be necessary for top executives to own stock to be residual claimants.

We conclude that independent outside directors enhance target shareholder gains from tender offers, and that boards with a majority of independent directors are more likely to use resistance strategies to enhance shareholder wealth.","['James F.

"Inside directors, board effectiveness, and shareholder wealth","We investigate whether inside managers are added to corporate boards for efficiency or entrenchment purposes. Our examination of inside director appointments finds that the stock-market reaction to the announcement is significantly negative when inside directors own less than 5% of the firm's common stock, significantly positive when their ownership level is between 5% and 25%, and insignificantly different from zero when ownership exceeds 25%. These results suggest that the expected benefits of an inside director's expert knowledge clearly out weigh the expected costs of managerial entrenchment only when managerial and outside shareholder interests are closely aligned.","['Stuart Rosenstein', 'Jeffrey G.

Return autocorrelation and institutional investors,"We propose and test the hypothesis that trading by institutional investors contributes to serial correlation in daily returns. Our results demonstrate that NYSE particles and individual security daily return autocorrelationsare an increasing function of the level of institutional ownership. Moreover, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that institutional trading reflects information and increases the speed of price adjustment. The relation between autocorrelation and institutional holdings does not, however, apparent to be driven by market frictions or rational time-varying required rates of return.

Ownership structure and top executive turnover,"We report that ownership structure significantly affects the likelihood of a change in top executive. Controlling for stock price performance, the probability of top executive turnover is negatively related to the ownership stake of officers and directors and positively related to the presence of an outside blockholder. In addition, the likehood of a change in top executive is significantly less sensitive to stock price performance in firms with higher managerial ownership. Finally, we document an unusually high rate of corporate control activity in the twelve months preceding top executive turnover. We conclude that ownership structure has an important influence on internal monitoring efforts and that this influence stems in part from the effect of ownership structure on external control threats.","['David J.

All troubled firms in our sample move to a more flexible organizational structure, with subsequent reductions in dividends, improvements in performance, and increases in asset sales and investments. Healthy firms that move to a tighter structure have larger free cash flows before the change; they increase dividends, reduce free cash flows and improve profitability after the change.

Corporate focus and value creation evidence from spinoffs,"We test a prediction from the corporate focus literature that cross-industry spinoff distributions, where the continuing and spunoff units belong to different two-digit Standard Industry Classification codes, create more value than own-industry spinoffs. Our results indicate significant value creation around the announcement of cross-industry spinoffs only. We then provide evidence on whether the value creation comes from operating performance improvements, or bonding benefits, or both, where bonding refers to a pre-commitment by managers to avoid cross-subsidizing relatively poor performing units within the firm. We find a significant improvement in operating performance for cross-industry spinoffs, and none for own-industry cases. We do not find strong evidence of bonding to explain spinoff-related value creation. Further, the operating performance improvement is associated with the continuing rather than the spunoff entity, consistent with the hypothesis that spinoffs create value by removing unrelated businesses and allowing managers to focus attention on the core operations they are best suited to manage.","['Lane Daley', 'Vikas Mehrotra', 'Ranjini Sivakumar']","['Spinoff', 'Divestiture', 'Focus', 'Cross-subsidization']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000184,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.6922889365695731,45,2,Lane Daley,1997,168.0358269208846
The market's response to recurring events the case of stock splits,A substantial body of literature suggests that stock splits convey information. In this paper we extend this literature by examining firms that split their stock at least twice during 1970–1988. We focus on firms with multiple splits to provide evidence on the market's use of previous split experience in interpreting a recurring event. Our major findings are that stock price responses to both stock splits and post-split earnings changes depend on earnings realizations observed after previous splits.

Dealer versus auction markets: A paired comparison of execution costs on NASDAQ and the NYSE,"Execution costs, as measured by the quoted spread, the effective spread (which accounts for trades inside the quotes), the realized spread (which measures revenues of suppliers of immediacy), the Roll (1984) implied spread, and the post-trade variability, are twice as large for a sample of NASDAQ stocks as they are for a matched sample of NYSE stocks. The difference is not due to differences in adverse information, in market depth, or in the frequency of even-eighth quotes. Partial explanations are provided by differences in the treatment of limit orders and commissions in the two markets. We conclude that important explanations are the internalization and preferencing of order flow and the presence of alternative interdealer trading systems, factors that limit dealers' incentives to narrow spreads on NASDAQ.","['Roger D.

In contrast, I find little evidence that pre-existing blockholders, particularly institutional holders, affect either the offer outcome or actively participate in the buyout contest once it begins.

Perceptions and the politics of finance: Junk bonds and the regulatory seizure of first capital life,"In May 1991, one month after seizing Executive Life, California regulators seized First Capital Life (FCLIC). Both insurers were Drexel clients with large junk bond holdings, and both had experienced ‘bank runs’. FCLIC's run followed regulators' televised comments that its poor condition necessitated a substantial cash infusion. Yet FCLIC's statutory capital — with junk bonds, real estate, and mortgages marked to market — was far from lowest among major insurers with California policyholders. It becomes lowest if junk bonds alone are marked to market at year-end 1990 (ignoring larger market declines in real estate/mortgages and the junk bond market's 21% return in early 1991). Our findings suggest a regulatory bias against junk bonds in the political backlash against the 1980s.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Stuart C.

Modeling the conditional distribution of interest rates as a regime-switching process,This paper develops a generalized regime-switching (GRS) model of the short-term interest rate. The model allows the short rate to exhibit both mean reversion and conditional heteroskedasticity and nests the popular generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and square root process specifications. The conditional variance process accommodates volatility clustering and dependence on the level of the interest rate. A first-order Markov process with state-dependent transition probabilities governs the switching between regimes. The GRS model is compared with various existing models of the short rate in terms of (1) the statistical fit of short-term interest rate data and (2) out-of-sample forecasting performance.,['Stephen F.

However, there is little evidence of poor performance prior to bids, suggesting that the high board turnover does not derive from past managerial failure. Hostile takeovers do not therefore perform a disciplining function. Instead, rejection of bids appears to derive from opposition to post-takeover redeployment of assets and renegotiation over the terms of bids.","['Julian Franks', 'Colin Mayer']","['Hostile takeovers', 'Executive dismissals']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500840B,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.7764472211795405,40,1,Julian Franks,1996,167.95168279122967

With little substitution between the runup and the markup, the runup is an added cost to the bidder. This finding has important implications for assessing the costs of insider trading. It also raises interesting questions about the role of information from public capital markets in private takeover negotiations.",['G.William Schwert'],"['Auctions', 'Insider trading', 'Takeovers', 'Premiums']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500865C,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.7764472211795405,41,2,G.William Schwert,1996,167.95168279122967
Detecting abnormal operating performance: The empirical power and specification of test statistics,"This research evaluates methods used in event studies that employ accounting-based measures of operating performance. We examine the choice of an accounting-based performance measure, a statistical test, and a model of expected operating performance. We document the impact of these choices on the test statistics designed to detect abnormal operating performance. We find that commonly used research designs yield test statistics that are misspecified in cases where sample firms have performed either unusually well or poorly. In this sampling situation, the test statistics are only well specified when sample firms are matched to control firms of similar pre-event performance.","['Brad M. Barber', 'John D.

Price stabilization as a bonding mechanism in new equity issues,Underwriters have an incentive to overstate investor interest in order to persuade some investors to purchase shares at a price in excess of their initial estimate of the fair value. We show that this incentive is eliminated when the underwriter commits to secondary market price stabilization. Destroying the underwriter's incentive to overstate interest reduces the total surplus captured by initial investors in initial public offerings. Further efficiency gains are associated with penalty bid systems that permit the underwriter to make the stabilization commitment selectively. Price stabilization can thus be viewed as a bonding mechanism that improves the efficiency of the primary equity market.,"['Lawrence M. Benveniste', 'Walid Y. Busaba', 'William J.

"Ownership dispersion, costly information, and IPO underpricing","We develop an explanation for IPO underpricing in which the issuer's demand for ownership dispersion creates an incentive to underprice. Promoting oversubscription allows broad initial ownership, which in turn increases secondary-market liquidity. Increased liquidity reduces the required return to investors. Broad initial ownership, however, requires an increase in investor-borne information costs. These information costs are offset through initial underpricing. Empirical results are consistent with initial underpricing reflecting the level of ownership dispersion.","['James R.

On average, the accounting performance of these firms is significantly better than their industries at the time of the initial public offering (IPO) and for at least the following four years, though there is some evidence of a decline in performance. Cross-sectional variation in accounting performance subsequent to the IPO is related to changes in the equity ownership of both operating management and other insiders, and is unrelated to changes in leverage.

Out-of-sample predictions of expected return are strongly and consistently accurate. Two findings distinguish this paper from others in the contemporary literature: First, stocks with higher expected and realized rates of return are unambiguously lower in risk than stocks with lower returns. Second, the important determinants of expected stock returns are strikingly common to the major equity markets of the world.

CEOs of firms with growth opportunities hold fewer outside directorships than CEOs of firms consisting primarily of assets-in-place. We find evidence consistent with CEOs holding more outside directorships as they transfer decision rights to their eventual successors. We also find that when employees (not necessarily CEOs) of two different firms sit on each other's boards, CEOs hold more outside directorships, suggesting CEO participation bonds the relationship between the two firms.

Theory prices this real option as an American put with both a stochastic strike price (exit value) and a stochastic value of the underlying security (the value of cash flows). The empirical implications are that firm value increases in exit value, after controlling for expected going-concern cash flows, and that more generalizable assets produce more abandonment option value. Using discounted earnings forecasts to proxy for expected cash flows and prior literature to categorize asset generalizability, we find strong support for the predictions of abandonment option theory.","['Philip G.

Competitors' stock prices are positively influenced by the interaction between the market's reaction to the announcing firm and the CSM.

Active investors and management turnover following unsuccessful control contests,"We report that 34% of targets of unsuccessful control contents between 1983 and 1989 experience a change in top manager within two years following the contest. Management turnover is concentrated among poorly performing firms in which outside blockholders acquire an ownership stake. These blockholders appear to facilitate post-contest asset restructurings that increase the value of the target and improve operating performance. In the absence of an outsider blockholder, managers typically retain their positions despite poor pre-contest performance and the use of value-reducing defensive tactics during the control contest. We conclude that monitoring by active outside investors facilitates valuable internal control efforts.","['David J. Denis', 'Jan M.

This negative relation between leverage and growth holds for firms with low Tobin's q ratio, but not for high-q firms or firms in high-q industries. Therefore, leverage does not reduce growth for firms known to have good investment opportunities, but is negatively related to growth for firms whose growth opportunities are either not recognized by the capital markets or are not sufficiently valuable to overcome the effects of their debt overhang.","['Larry Lang', 'Eli Ofek', 'RenéM.

The interindustry patterns in the rate of takeovers and restructurings are directly related to the economic shocks borne by the sample industries. These results support the argument that much of the takeover activity during the 1980s was driven by broad fundamental factors and have general implications for the stock price spillover effects of takeover announcements, corporate performance following takeovers, and the timing of takeover waves.","['Mark L.

Using a variety of model specifications and definitions of favorable dividend signals, we find virtually no support for the notion that dividend decisions help identify firms with superior future earnings. Dividends tend not to be reliable signals because (i) a behavioral bias (overoptimism) leads managers to overestimate future earnings when growth prospects fade; and (ii) managers make only modest cash commitments when they increase dividends, undermining the reliability of such signals.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Douglas J.

Our results indicate that the probability of obtaining external funds is unrelated to the shortfall in internally generated funds, although firms with cash surpluses avoid external financing.

When-issued volume is higher under uniform as compared to discriminatory auctions, suggesting a higher information release, which should reduce pre-auction uncertainty and the winner's curse. Under uniform auctions, when-issued volatility falls after the auction and again after the outcome announcement. The pattern is the opposite for discriminatory auctions. This is further evidence that uniform auctions increase pre-auction information and lower the short squeeze.

Multifactor models do not explain deviations from the CAPM,"A number of studies have presented evidence rejecting the validity of the Sharpe-Lintner capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Possible alternatives include risk-based models, such as multifactor asset pricing models, or nonrisk-based models which address biases in empirical methodology, the existence of market frictions, or the presence of irrational investors. Distinguishing between the alternatives is important for applications such as cost of capital estimation. This paper develops a framework which shows that, ex ante, CAPM deviations due to missing risk factors will be very difficult to detect empirically, whereas deviations resulting from nonrisk-based sources are easily detectable.

The company tied executive compensation to shareholder wealth creation, and subsequently implemented a strategy that included downsizing, restructuring, and exit. Paying large executive cash bonuses amid layoffs ignited controversy. However, by 1993 shareholders realized gains approaching $4.5 billion, representing a dividend-reinvested return of 553%.

The Nestlé crash,"On November 17, 1988, the board of directors of Nestlé AG decided to allow foreign investors to hold Nestlé registered stock, reversing a longstanding practice. This decision had a tremendous impact on the prices of the firm's three classes of common stock, as well as on the prices of several other corporations traded on the Zürich stock exchange.

The use of warrants as underwriter compensation in initial public offerings,"Previous research suggests that offering costs are higher when warrants are used to compensate underwriters. This finding potentially arises from a failure to account for self-selection in estimating offering cost relations.

Evidence on the strategic allocation of initial public offerings,"The evidence reported in this paper suggests that institutional investors capture a large fraction of the short-run profits associated with IPOs. The favored status enjoyed by institutional investors in underpriced offerings appears, however, to carry a quid pro quo expectation that they will participate in less-attractive issues as well.

This is the first empirical examination of the relationship between computed firm-specific tax savings and firm value, and therefore provides evidence that helps resolve the theoretical dispute over ESOP tax savings.

All in the family Nesting symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models,"This paper develops a parametric family of models of generalized autoregressive heteroskedasticity (GARCH). The family nests the most popular symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models, thereby highlighting the relation between the models and their treatment of asymmetry. Furthermore, the structure permits nested tests of different types of asymmetry and functional forms.

Capital market imperfections and the incentive to lease,"This paper evaluates the influence of financial contracting costs on public corporations' incentives to lease fixed capital. We argue that firms facing high costs of external funds can economize on the cost of funding by leasing. We construct several measures of leasing propensity, plus some a priori indicators of the severity of financial constraints facing firms. We find that the share of total annual fixed capital costs attributable to either capital or operating leases is substantially higher at lower-rated, non-dividend-paying, cash-poor firms — those likely to face relatively high premiums for external funds.","['Steven A.

Coercive tender and exchange offers in distressed high-yield debt restructurings An empirical analysis,"This paper examines a recent sample of public workouts for distressed high-yield debt. The nature of holdouts and the effectiveness of coercive tactics in alleviating the holdout problem is analyzed. Tender offers are in relatively less financial distress, exhibit more severe holdouts, and are more coercive than exchange offers. Tender offers also have higher completion rates and fewer Chapter 11 filings. Security prices react positively to announcements of tender offers, negatively to exchange offers. Evidence suggests that coercion is not detrimental to bondholders, and may benefit security holders by increasing the likelihood of a less costly, out-of-court restructuring.","['Sris Chatterjee', 'Upinder S.

Executive pay and performance Evidence from the U.S. banking industry,"This paper examines CEO pay in the banking industry and the effect of deregulating the market for corporate control. Using panel data on 147 banks over the 1980s, we find higher levels of pay in competitive corporate control markets, i.e., those in which interstate banking is permitted. We also find a stronger pay-performance relation in deregulated interstate banking markets. Finally, CEO turnover increases substantially after deregulation. These results provide evidence of a managerial talent market — one which matches the level and structure of pay with the competitiveness of the banking environment.","['R.Glenn Hubbard', 'Darius Palia']","['Pay', 'Performance', 'Corporate control', 'Deregulation', 'Banks']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400816J,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.8606055057895077,39,1,R.Glenn Hubbard,1995,167.86753866157474
Does Section 16b deter insider trading by target managers?,"This paper examines empirically whether the short-swing rule (Section 16b of the Securities Exchange Act) deters managers from trading before mergers. Since a merger forces the sale of the target's outstanding equity, insider purchases within six months before the merger cannot escape this rule. We examine the 1941–1961 period when no other insider trading laws were enforced. Consistent with 16b's deterrent effect, managers' purchases drop significantly before the announcement. Before completion, the decrease occurs only in the 1941–1955 period. Surprisingly, pre-announcement sales do not decline, even though 16b cannot punish deferral of planned sales.","['Anup Agrawal', 'Jeffrey F.

Contrary to results in several recent papers, these data indicate there is no significant difference in within industry mean takeover premia levels. There is evidence, though, that the sensitivity of takeover premia levels to standard transaction characteristics does differ across buyers: Foreign investors do pay more than domestic investors in hostile transactions, but pay less when there are rival bidders.

The probability increases by about the same amount regardless of whether the change is an apparent age-65 retirement or a resignation. Overall, the results are consistent with a variety of agency-based theories of corporate investment and suggest that management changes are important events for corporations because they lead to reversals of poor prior decisions.",['Michael S.

Evidence on the deterrence and wealth effects of modern antitakeover measures,"This paper provides large-sample evidence that poison pill rights issues, control share laws, and business combination laws have not systematically deterred takeovers and are unlikely to have caused the demise of the 1980s market for corporate control, even though 87% of all exchange-listed firms are now covered by one of these antitakeover measures. We show that poison pills and control share laws are reliably associated with higher takeover premiums for selling shareholders, both unconditionally and conditional on a successful takeover, and we provide updated event study evidence for the three-quarters of all poison pills not yet analyzed.

In three industries, output is negatively associated with the average industry debt ratio. In the one industry which shows a positive association between output and debt ratios, rival firms have low financial leverage and entry barriers are relatively low.

"Asset sales, firm performance, and the agency costs of managerial discretion","We argue that management sells assets when doing so provides the cheapest funds to pursue its objectives rather than for operating efficiency reasons alone. This hypothesis suggests that (1) firms selling assets have high leverage and/or poor performance, (2) a successful asset sale is good news, and (3) the stock market discounts asset sale proceeds retained by the selling firm. In support of this hypothesis, we find that the typical firm in our sample performs poorly before the sale and that the average stock-price reaction to asset sales is positive only when the proceeds are paid out.","['Larry Lang', 'Annette Poulsen', 'René Stulz']",['Asset sales'],[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400791X,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.8606055057895077,37,1,Larry Lang,1995,167.86753866157474
Problems in measuring portfolio performance An application to contrarian investment strategies,"We document problems in measuring raw and abnormal five-year contrarian portfolio returns. ‘Loser’ stocks are low-priced and exhibit skewed return distributions. Their 163% mean return is due largely to their lowest-price quartile position. A $18-th price increase reduces the mean by 25%, highlighting their sensitivity to micro-structure/liquidity effects. Long positions in low-priced loser stocks occur disproportionately after bear markets and thus induce expected-return effects. A contrarian portfolio formed at June-end earns negative abnormal returns, in contrast with the December-end portfolio.

Diversification's effect on firm value,We estimate diversification's effect on firm value by imputing stand-alone values for individual business segments. Comparing the sum of these stand-alone values to the firm's actual value implies a 13% to 15% average value loss from diversification during 1986–1991.

For ‘value’ stocks, companies more likely to be repurchasing shares because of undervaluation, the average abnormal return is 45.3%. For repurchases announced by ‘glamour’ stocks, where undervaluation is less likely to be an important motive, no positive drift in abnormal returns is observed.

Following their recaps, the distressed firms exhibit (1) poor operating performance due largely to industry-wide problems, (2) surprisingly low proceeds from asset sales, and (3) negative stock price reactions to economic and regulatory events associated with the demise of the market for highly-leveraged transactions. The incidence of distress is not related to several characteristics that have previously been linked with poorly-structured deals. We thus attribute the high rate of distress primarily to unexpected macroeconomic and regulatory developments.","['David J. Denis', 'Diane K.

Firm failure and managerial labor markets evidence from Texas banking,"We study the managerial labor market's ability to discriminate between good and bad managerial performance. Using a sample of failed and nonfailed Texas banks, we find that the context of job loss affects the manager's ability to regain comparable employment. Managers associated with banks that failed for reasons arguably beyond the managers' control were twice as likely to regain comparable banking posts as managers at other failed banks. We also detect a relation between the probability of post-failure reemployment and a manager's rank within the firm and to proxies for managerial self-dealing and competence.","['Albert A.

"The collapse of First Executive Corporation junk bonds, adverse publicity, and the ‘run on the bank’ phenomenon","In April 1991, regulators seized the major subsidiaries of First Executive Corporation (FE), an insurer that invested heavily in junk bonds. During the junk bond market turmoil of 1989–1990, adverse publicity fueled a bank run at FE, forcing a $4 billion portfolio liquidation before the market rose 50–60% in 1991–1992. More traditional insurers did not receive commensurate press coverage, despite their substantial exposure to real estate declines, which were roughly 2.5 times the junk bond decline. Seizure of FE's subsidiaries was defensible, although FE would have become solvent within a year, given average junk bond market appreciation.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Stuart C Gilson']","['Junk bonds', 'Bank runs', 'Insurance', 'Financial distress', 'Politics of finance']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900086,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.944763790399475,36,3,Harry DeAngelo,1994,167.7833945319198
Voucher privatization,"Several Eastern European countries have initiated mass privatization programs to transfer state-owned assets to the general population. We show that the decision to pursue mass privatization and even the specific design of the programs are largely dictated by politics.

What do firms do with cash windfalls?,"Suppose that a firm receives a cash windfall which does not change its investment opportunity set or, equivalently, its marginal Tobin's Q. What will this firm do with the money? We provide empirical answers to this question using a sample of eleven firms with such windfalls in the form of a won or settled lawsuit. We examine a variety of decisions of the firm to shed light on alternative theories of corporate financing and investment. Our evidence is broadly inconsistent with the perfect capital markets model. The results need to be stretched considerably to fit the asymmetric information model in which managers act in the interest of shareholders. The evidence supports the agency model of managerial behavior, in which managers try to ensure the long-run survival and independence of the firms with themselves at the helm.","['Olivier Jean Blanchard', 'Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes', 'Andrei Shleifer']","['Cash flow', 'Agency theory', 'Lawsuits']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900094,Journal of Financial Economics,-0.944763790399475,36,3,Olivier Jean Blanchard,1994,167.7833945319198
Organizational form and the consequences of highly leveraged transactions: Kroger's recapitalization and Safeway's LBO,"This paper compares the leveraged recapitalization of Kroger Co. with the leveraged buyout of Safeway Stores. While both transactions dramatically increased leverage, Safeway's also altered managerial ownership, board composition, and executive compensation, while Kroger's did not. My analysis suggests that these differences in organizational form lead to large differences in post-HLT restructuring actions and value creation.

Appointments of outsiders to Japanese boards: Determinants and implications for managers,This paper investigates the determinants of appointments of outsiders — directors previously employed by banks (bank directors) or by other nonfinancial firms (corporate directors) — to the boards of large nonfinancial Japanese corporations. Such appointments increase with poor stock performance; those of bank directors also increase with earnings losses. Turnover of incumbent top executives increases substantially in the year of both types of outside appointments. We perform a similar analysis for outside appointments in large U.S. firms and find different patterns.

The post-bankruptcy value includes all direct and indirect costs of bankruptcy and financial distress. Federated's assets increased in value by $3.1 billion in 1992 dollars(or $1.6 billion in 1987 dollars). This increase is only slightly below that in Kaplan (1989), suggesting that net bankruptcy costs were modest, and, possibly, nonexistent. The Federated purchase illustrates that a highly-leveraged transaction can increase value, but still be unable to meet its debt obligations; and bankruptcy (and financial distress) need not be costly.",['Steven N.

For the average pair of firms, the combined drop in value upon filing is $21 million. Much of the loss is regained if the suit is settled.

Finite sample properties of the generalized method of moments in tests of conditional asset pricing models,"We develop evidence on the finite sample properties of the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) in an asset pricing context. The models imply nonlinear, cross-equation restrictions on predictive regressions for security returns. We find that a two-stage GMM approach produces goodness-of-fit statistics that reject the restrictions too often. An iterated GMM approach has superior finite sample properties. The coefficient estimates are approximately unbiased in simpler models, but their asymptotic standard errors are understated. Simple adjustments for the standard errors are partially successful in correcting the bias. In more complex models the coefficients and their standard errors can be highly unreliable. The power of the tests to reject a single-premium model is higher against a two-premium, fixed-beta alternative than against a conditional Capital Asset Pricing Model with time-varying betas.","['Wayne E.

We find that recovery rates for creditors, on average, are higher in distressed exchanges than in Chapter 11 reorganizations, as are equity deviations from absolute priority. The difference in deviations potentially provides valuable information on the higher costs of formal reorganization. Also, cash is used more extensively to redeem creditors' claims in Chapter 11 than in distressed exchanges.

The reciprocal allocation of control rights supports cooperation and mutual monitoring among managers through a coalition-enforced threat of removal from control. In financial distress this threat is less effective, and the governance mode shifts to hierarchical enforcement under main bank leadership.

Posted versus effective spreads,"When trades are executed inside the posted bid-ask spread, the posted spread is no longer an accurate measure of transactions costs faced by investors. Using two samples of market orders, one based on orders submitted by retail brokers and one based on orders submitted electronically to the NYSE, we document a significant difference between the posted spread and the effective spread paid by investors. For most orders, the effective spread averages half the posted spread. In addition, when the posted spread widens, only 10 to 22% of the increase appears in the effective spread. These results have significant implications for any empirical work that uses the posted spread as a measure of the cost of trading. Our findings also document a significant difference in the expected execution price across exchanges.

Consistent with the literature on foreign direct investment and the market for corporate control, bidder-specific characteristics and exchange-rate movements are useful in explaining the cross-sectional variation in bidder returns: returns to Japanese bidders and to the portfolio of Japanese bidders and U.S. targets increase with the bidder's leverage, the bidder's ties to financial institutions through borrowings, and the depreciation of the dollar in relation to the Japanese yen.",['Jun-Koo Kang'],"['Japanese mergers and acquisitions', 'Monitoring', 'Exchange-rate movement', 'Bidder return']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900316,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.0289220750094423,34,3,Jun-Koo Kang,1993,167.6992504022649
"The winner's curse, legal liability, and the long-run price performance of initial public offerings in Finland","Rationing data for initial public offerings (IPOs) in the Finnish market make possible a test of Rock's (1986) winner's curse hypothesis. The evidence from 80 IPOs issued between 1984 and 1989 confirms the presence of the winner's curse: average returns adjusted for the bias in allocation are lower than average unadjusted returns. But the initial returns of these IPOs appear unrelated to lawsuit avoidance, as the sample firms seem unlikely to incur legal liabilities. In the long run, consistent with the evidence in the United States, the IPO firms substantially underperform the Helsinki Stock Exchange value-weighted index.",['Matti Keloharju'],"['Initial public offerings', 'Legal liability', 'Long-run performance', ""Winner's curse""]",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9390020C,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.0289220750094423,34,2,Matti Keloharju,1993,167.6992504022649
NYSE vs NASDAQ returns,"Reinganum (1990) reports that small NYSE securities have average returns about 6% per year higher than those of similarly-sized NASDAQ securities during the 1973–1988 period. He attributes the return differential to market microstructure differences. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that differences in the characteristics of the companies listed on the two exchanges explain much of the disparity. About 60% of the return differential can be attributed to the poor performance of recent initial public offerings, which comprise a large portion of the firms on NASDAQ. On average, IPOs underperform during the six calendar years after going public.",['Tim Loughran'],[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9390006W,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.0289220750094423,33,2,Tim Loughran,1993,167.6992504022649
An empirical investigation of IPO returns and subsequent equity offerings,"Several recent papers present signaling models in which firms underprice their initial public offerings of equity (IPOs) so that they can subsequently issue seasoned equity at more favorable prices. We test the implications of these models. We find a positive relation between IPO underpricing and the probability and size of subsequent seasoned offerings. Although these results are consistent with the implications of the signaling hypotheses, the economic significance appears weak. We conduct additional tests to evaluate other explanations for these findings and find the alternatives more compelling.","['Narasimhan Jegadeesh', 'Mark Weinstein', 'Ivo Welch']","['IPO underpricing', 'Market-feedback hypothesis', 'Seasoned equity offering', 'Signaling hypothesis']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900165,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.0289220750094423,34,2,Narasimhan Jegadeesh,1993,167.6992504022649
Private benefits from block ownership and discounts on closed-end funds,"The greater the managerial stock ownership in closed-end funds, the larger are the discounts to net asset value. The average discount for funds with blockholders is 14%, whereas the average discount for funds without blockholders is only 4%. This relation is robust over time and to various model specifications that control for other factors that affect discounts. We argue that blockholders receive private benefits that do not accrue to other shareholders and that they veto open-ending proposals to preserve these benefits. We support this argument by documenting a range of potential private benefits received by blockholders in closed-end funds.","['Michael J. Barclay', 'Clifford G.

The hidden costs of stock market liquidity,"The seemingly unrelated problems of stock market liquidity and manager-stockholder contracting are closely intertwined. Active stockholders who reduce agency costs by providing internal monitoring also reduce stock liquidity by creating information asymmetry problems. Conversely, stock liquidity discourages internal monitoring by reducing the costs of ‘exit’ of unhappy stockholders.

An empirical study of the Mexican Treasury bill auction,This paper analyzes bidding behavior in Mexican Treasury bill auctions for the period 1986–1991. The Mexican auction rules resemble those used in U.S. Treasury bill auctions closely. Results suggest the presence of collusion among large bidders throughout a large portion of the sampling period and the presence of information asymmetries between small and large bidders. Results also suggest that bidders account for the winner's curse and that participants bid more cautiously when uncertainty is high.

We report reliable evidence that the ex ante risk premium is negative in some states of the world; these states are related to periods of high expected inflation and especially to downward-sloping term structures.","['Jacob Boudoukh', 'Matthew Richardson', 'Tom Smith']","['Ex ante risk premium', 'Inequality restrictions', 'Conditional asset pricing models']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900338,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.0289220750094423,34,3,Jacob Boudoukh,1993,167.6992504022649
The underpricing of initial public offerings and the partial adjustment phenomenon,"This paper documents that the relation of the final offer price to the range of anticipated offer prices disclosed in the preliminary prospectus is a good predictor of initial returns. Issues that have final offer prices which exceed the limits of the offer range have greater underpricing than all other initial public offerings, and are also more likely to increase the number of shares issued.

The seasonal behavior of the liquidity premium in asset pricing,"This paper empirically investigates the seasonal behavior of the liquidity premium in asset pricing. The evidence suggests a strong seasonal component. In the 1961–1990 period, the liquidity premium is reliably positive only during the month of January. For the non-January months, one cannot detect a positive liquidity premium. The impact of the relative bid-ask spreads on asset pricing in non-January months cannot be reliably distinguished from zero. In contrast to Amihud and Mendelson (1986), however, our evidence suggests that the size effect is significant, even after controlling for spreads.","['Venkat R. Eleswarapu', 'Marc R.

We develop a model which predicts that, in public debt exchange offers, firms with unfavorable private information will offer equity claims to convince bondholders that the firm's prospects are poor. In contrast, offering equity to well-informed private lenders conveys favorable private information to outsiders. Consistent with our analysis, we find positive average abnormal returns around restructurings that offer equity to private lenders and senior debt to public debtholders, and we find significant negative average abnormal returns when private lenders are offered senior debt and public lenders are offered equity.","['David T.

Investments of uncertain cost,"This paper examines irreversible investment decisions when projects take time to complete and are subject to two types of cost uncertainty. The first is technical uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty over the physical difficulty of completing a project, which is only resolved as the investment proceeds. The second is input cost uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty over the prices of construction inputs or over government regulations affecting construction costs, which is external to the firm. These two types of uncertainty have very different effects on the investment decision.

Institutional trades and intraday stock price behavior,"This paper examines the price effect of institutional stock trading, using a unique data set that reports the transactions (large and small) of 37 large institutional money management firms. The direction of each trade and the identity of the management firm behind each trade are known. Although institutional trades are associated with some price pressure, we find that the average effect is small. There is also a marked asymmetry between the price impact of buys versus sells. We relate our findings to various hypotheses on the elasticity of demand for stocks, the cost of executing transactions, and the determinants of market impact. Although market capitalization and relative trade size influence the market impact of a trade, the dominant influence is the identity of the money manager behind the trade.","['Louis K.C.

There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors, related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns.

Increased short-term debt leads lenders to liquidate too often. It also increases the sensitivity of financing costs to new information, although better-than-average borrowers desire information sensitivity.

Underwriter price support and the IPO underpricing puzzle,"This paper reassesses the apparent systematic underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs). Investigation of the distribution of initial returns following IPOs shows that positive mean initial returns may reflect the existence of a partially unobserved left (negative) tail. Moreover, most IPOs with zero one-day returns subsequently fall in price, suggesting that underwriter price support may account for the skewed distribution and hence the phenomenon of positive average initial IPO returns, even if offering prices are set at expected market value. This paper thus challenges the presumption underlying previous research that positive average initial IPO returns result primarily from deliberate underpricing.",['Judith S Ruud'],"['Initial public offerings', 'IPO underpricing', 'Price support', 'Stabilization']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900154,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.0289220750094423,34,2,Judith S Ruud,1993,167.6992504022649

The negative autocorrelation in long-horizon index returns, along with the selection criterion of the contrarian strategy, can explain the positive covariance between time-varying betas and risk premiums. However, test-period beta estimates reflect the reversal of earnings expectations associated with underlying factors. The controversy thus reduces to the debate of Fama and French (1988) and Poterba and Summers (1988) over the source of the temporary price components in the market index.

In a sample of 358 firms that perform poorly for a year, higher predistress leverage increases the probability of operational actions, particularly asset restructuring and employee layoffs. Higher predistress leverage also increases the probability of financial actions such as dividend cuts.

Price stabilization in the market for new issues,"This study examines price stabilization in new equity issues. Stabilizationtruncates the distribution of post-issue prices at a floor price, lowering the risk of adverse price moves and hence, in a competitive dealer market, reducing the bid-ask spread. Using 1.523 NASDAO-traded firm- commitment initial public offerings issued between 1982 and 1987, we find that spreads narrow when the market price is close to the offer price and stabilization is most likely. Moreover, significant negative returns are documented after the hypothesized termination of stabilizing activities, suggesting that stabilization, and its cessation, affect market prices.","['Kathleen Weiss Hanley', 'A.Arun Kumar', 'Paul J Seguin']","['Initial public offerings', 'Bid-ask spreads', 'Microstructure', 'Options pricing']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900176,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.0289220750094423,34,2,Kathleen Weiss Hanley,1993,167.6992504022649

"Contract costs, bank loans, and the cross-monitoring hypothesis",I examine whether monitoring-related contract costs are reflected in bank loan spreads and find evidence that cross-monitoring by senior and subordinate claimholders is associated with smaller spreads. I also find that loan spreads reflect financial contract costs of controlling borrower behavior toward the assets being financed. These results support the importance of contract costs in firms' financing decisions and provide evidence of the importance of monitoring in bank lending arrangements.,['James R.

Initial public offerings of equity securities,"In contrast with numerous studies that find significant underpricing for initial public offerings of industrial firms, we document a statistically significant average return of −2.82% on the first trading day for a sample of 87 initial public offerings of real estate investment trusts during the 1971–1988 period. Our overpricing result is invariant to offer price, issue size, distribution method, offer period, and underwriter reputation. Newly issued REITs, on average, substantially underperform a matching sample of seasoned REITs during the first 190 trading days. Interestingly, buyers of overpriced REITs are predominantly individual or non-13(f) institutional investors.","['Ko Wang', 'Su Han Chan', 'George W.

No news is good news,"It seems plausible that an increase in stock market volatility raises required stock returns, and thus lowers stock prices. We develop a formal model of this volatility feedback effect using a simple model of changing variance (a quadratic generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic, or QGARCH, model). Our model is asymmetric and helps to explain the negative skewness and excess kurtosis of U.S. monthly and daily stock returns over the period 1926–1988. We find that volatility feedback normally has little effect on returns, but it can be important during periods of high volatility.","['John Y.

Market volatility prediction and the efficiency of the S & P 100 index option market,"Most models of market volatility use either past returns or ex post volatility to forecast volatility. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of market volatility is assessed by forecasting the volatility implied in the transaction prices of Standard & Poor's 100 index options. We test and reject the hypothesis that volatility changes are unpredictable. However, while our statistical model delivers precise forecasts, abnormal returns are not possible in a trading strategy (based on daily out-of-sample volatility projections) which takes transaction costs into account, suggesting that predictable time-varying volatility is consistent with market efficiency.","['Campbell R.

We address two aspects of trading by these money managers: herding, which refers to buying (selling) simultaneously the same stocks as other managers buy (sell), and positive-feedback trading, which refers to buying past winners and selling past losers. These two aspects of trading are commonly a part of the argument that institutions destabilize stock prices.

Adverse selection and the rights offer paradox,"We develop an analytical framework to explain firm's choice of equity flotation method and the near disappearance of rights offers by U.S. exchange-listed firms. The choice between uninsured rights, rights with standby underwriting, and firm-commitment underwriting depends on information asymmetries, shareholder characteristics, and direct flotation costs. Underwriter certification and current-shareholder takeup are viewed as substitute mechanisms for minimizing wealth transfers between shareholders and outside investors. Uninsured rights create adverse-selection effects when shareholder takeup is low.

Unlike existing models of discrete transactions prices, ordered probit can quantify the effects of other economic variables like volume, past price changes, and the time between trades on price changes. Using 1988 transactions data for over 100 randomly chosen U.S. stocks, we estimate the ordered probit model via maximum likelihood and use the parameter estimates to measure several transaction-related quantities, such as the price impact of trades of a given size, the tendency towards price reversals from one transaction to the next, and the empirical significance of price discreteness.","['Jerry A.

Merged firms show significant improvements in asset productivity relative to their industries, leading to higher operating cash flow returns. This performance improvement is particularly strong for firms with highly overlapping businesses. Mergers do not lead to cuts in long-term capital and R&D investments. There is a strong positive relation between postmerger increases in operating cash flows and abnormal stock returns at merger announcements, indicating that expectations of economic improvements underlie the equity revaluations of the merging firms.","['Paul M.

Once we control for post-earnings-announcement drift, differences in abnormal returns across Value Line timeliness ranks are no longer significant.

Choosing the method of sale,"This paper analyzes the sale of Conrail (Consolidated Rail Corporation) and finds three problems: first, a contingent claim gave the seller (the U.S. Government) conflicting objectives; second, bidders in the auction valued Conrail differently and thus did not compete effectively; and third, Conrail's management had an information advantage over the seller and outside bidders. These three factors can be present in any corporate divestiture and will tend to decrease the seller's revenue. We discuss how different methods of sale (e.g., two-stage auctions and parallel secret negotiations) will counteract these problems to varying degrees, although we find no single ‘best’ method.","['Carliss Y.

Proxy voting and the SEC,"This paper analyzes the SEC's proxy regulations and assesses their effects on corporate governance. The proxy rules began in 1935 as a minimal series of disclosure requirements and a prohibition against fraud. By 1956, they imposed extensive and wide-ranging disclosure requirements on anyone wishing to communicate about voting issues and required that all such communications be cleared in advance — in essence, censored — by the SEC. I present evidence that since that time, the rules have significantly increased the costs of communication and coordinated action among shareholders. They have thus deterred shareholder initiatives and inhibited the development of a private market for information about voting issues.",['John Pound'],[],[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X91900033,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.1972386442293768,29,2,John Pound,1991,167.53096214295505
Were Japanese stock prices too high?,"This paper asks whether market fundamentals can explain the recent run-up and decline of Japanese equity values and price-earnings ratios. Accounting differences explain about half of the long-run disparity between U.S. and Japanese P/Es. For example, if Japanese firms used U.S. accounting rules, the Japanese P/E ratio would have been 32.6, not 53.7, in 1989. Accounting differences cannot, however, explain the doubling of this ratio in 1986, nor its decline in 1990. Similarly, we are unable to isolate changes in required stock returns or growth expectations that are large enough to explain recent Japanese stock price movements.","['Kenneth R. French', 'James M.

A Bayesian model of intraday specialist pricing,"This paper develops and tests a model of intraday security price movements which incorporates the effects of both trading volume and unanticipated information. We estimate our model using transaction data from a NYSE specialist and find strong evidence of information asymmetry, although the inventory effect appears weak. The parameter estimates are used to compute the costs of trading, and we find that implicit bid-ask spreads were significantly higher in October 1987 than in the rest of that year.

The staying power of leveraged buyouts,"This paper documents the organizational status over time of 183 large leveraged buyouts completed between 1979 and 1986. By August 1990, 62% of the LBOs are privately owned, 14% are independent public companies, and 24% are owned by other public companies. The percentage of LBOs returning to public ownership increases over time, with LBOs remaining private for a median time of 6.82 years. The majority of LBOs, therefore, are neither short-lived nor permanent. The moderate fraction of LBO assets owned by other companies implies that asset sales play a role, but are not the primary motivating force in LBO transactions.",['Steven N.

A multicountry comparison of term-structure forecasts at long horizons,"This paper extends previous work on the information in the U.S. term structure at longer maturities to Britain, West Germany, and Switzerland. We find strong evidence that the term structure does have significant ability to forecast changes in inflation, particularly at long maturities. On the other hand, the ability of the term structure to forecast changes in one-year interest rates is somewhat weaker; only at the very longest horizon (five years) is there significant forecasting ability for interest-rate changes.","['Philippe Jorion', 'Frederic Mishkin']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9190013A,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.1972386442293768,29,1,Philippe Jorion,1991,167.53096214295505

Opportunistic underinvestment in debt renegotiation and capital structure,"This paper models debt renegotiation as a bargaining game between debtholders and shareholder-oriented management, in which management credibly threatens to run down firm assets to force concessions from the creditors. Creditors anticipate this opportunistic behavior by management, creating an upper bound on debt capacity that is less than the value of the firm. If an advantage to debt is introduced, such as favorable tax treatment, an interior optimal capital structure obtains even in the absence of realized bankruptcy costs. Our model also explains variations in debt-equity ratios and the use of certain puzzling debt covenants.","['Yaacov Z. Bergman', 'Jeffrey L.

Union negotiations and corporate policy,"This paper studies managerial compensation, financial reporting, and dividend policies of the seven major domestic steel producers during requests for union concessions. Substantial layoffs, reported losses, and sacrifices by nonunion stakeholders buttressed managers' case for union concessions. From 1980 to 1988, sample firms reduced their work force by about 300,000 (almost two-thirds) and annual wage payments from $16.1 to $8.6 billion. Reported income is lower during union negotiations, controlling for cash flows, as is managerial pay, with average CEO salary plus bonus declining 18%.

Is corporate bankruptcy efficient?,"Auctions allocate resources to their highest-valued uses. Yet bankruptcy does not use auctions. Instead judges determine a value and parcel out interests on the assumption that this valuation is correct. Errors inevitable in this process lead many persons to conclude that bankruptcy is inefficient. This essay argues that the conclusion does not follow. The costs of error in valuation may be less than the cost of conducting an auction. Legal rules endure because they are efficient or because they transfer wealth.

There is little evidence that buyouts lead to widespread employee layoffs, wage reductions, or wealth transfers from bondholders. LBOs continue to be controversial, however. Future research should focus on the effect of buyouts on firms' strategic investments, buyout firms' performance under difficult economic conditions, and the frequency and costs of financial distress associated with buyouts. Research can also focus on improving the performance of public corporations by examining the individual contributions of debt, management ownership, and corporate governance changes to podt-buyout performance.",['Krishna G.

Corporate research and development expenditures and share value,"Share-price responses to 95 announcements of increased research and development (R & D) spending are significantly positive on average, even when the announcement occurs in the face of an earnings decline. High-technology firms that announce increases in R & D spending experience positive abnormal returns on average, whereas announcements by low-technology firms are associated with negative abnormal returns. Further, in our cross-sectional analyses we find that higher R & D intensity than the industry average leads to larger stock-price increases only for firms in high-technology industries.","['Su Han Chan', 'John D Martin', 'John W Kensinger']",[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9090005K,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.281396928839344,26,2,Su Han Chan,1990,167.44681801330012
"Large-block transactions, the speed of response, and temporary and permanent stock-price effects","The paper investigates how quickly prices attain new equilibrium levels after large-block transactions, and measures the associated temporary and permanent price effects. We find that prices adjust within at most three trades, with most of the adjustment occurring in the first trade. The temporary price effect for seller-initiated transactions is related to block size, but the temporary price effect observed for buyer-initiated transactions is no larger than that observed in 100 share trades. Most of the price effect associated with block trades is permanent and is related to block size, regardless of the initiating party.","['Robert W. Holthausen', 'Richard W.

How risky is the debt in highly leveraged transactions?,"This paper estimates the systematic risk of the debt in public leveraged recapitalizations. We calculate this risk as a function of the difference in systematic equity risk before and after the recapitalization. The increase in equity risk is surprisingly small after a recapitalization, ranging from 37% to 57%, depending on the estimation method. If total company risk is unchanged, the implied systematic risk of the post-recapitalization debt in twelve transactions averages 0.65. Alternatively, if the entire market-adjusted premium in the leveraged recapitalization represents a reduction in fixed costs, the implied systematic risk of this debt averages 0.40.","['Steven N.

Whereas U.S. institutional investors are restricted from doing so, Japanese financial institutions take large equity positions in firms to which they lend, particularly in firms more susceptible to the agency problem. Debt ratios of U.S. firms are negatively related to the firm's potential to engage in risky, suboptimal investments, whereas Japanese debt ratios show no such relation.

ESOPs and corporate control,"This paper examines the effects of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) on shareholder wealth. ESOPs established in the presence of takeover activity reduce share values, by approximately 4% on average. ESOPs also reduce share values if they are structured to transfer control away from outside shareholders, by creating a new ownership block with veto power over takeover bids. Large ESOPs established with nonvoting stock, so as to preclude any immediate control transfers, result in a significant increase in share values. The wealth effect of any given ESOP thus depends upon both its incentive and control effects on the corporation.","['Lilli A.

"Borrowing relationships, intermediation, and the cost of issuing public securities","This paper investigates how an established borrowing relationship affects the costs associated with initial public offerings of equity. Our model illustrates how the existence of a borrowing relationship reduces the ex ante uncertainty about the value of the issuing firm's equity in the secondary market. If underpricing is related to uncertainty, a borrowing relationship can reduce underpricing. Empirically, we find that, other things equal, IPOs of firms with previously established borrowing relationships are underpriced substantially less than other IPOs.","['Christopher James', 'Peggy Wier']",[],[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9090051Z,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.281396928839344,28,1,Christopher James,1990,167.44681801330012
Wealth effects of regulatory reform,"This paper investigates the effect of California's Proposition 103 on the market value of publicly traded property- and liability-insurance companies. The passage of this referendum on November 8, 1988 moved California from a market-oriented to a heavily regulated insurance-pricing system. During the period surrounding the election, the average stock price of insurance companies doing business in California declined by 6.91%. The decline is positively related to the proportion of a firm's premiums affected by the referendum and the proportion generated in other states where insurance regulation is likely to change, and negatively related to the firm's profitability.","['Joseph A.

To politicians, agency problems represent entitlements to be allocated among favored constituencies.

The relation does not appear in a sample of non-ex-dividend days.

Until July 1982 OID debt offered large tax advantages. Before that date stock-price responses to announcements of OID debt are significantly positive, in contrast to the negative, albeit insignificant, responses associated with par debt announcements. No stock-price gains are observed for OID debt issued after the tax advantages are removed.

The curve slopes upward until insider ownership reaches approximately 40% to 50% and then slopes slightly downward.

If investors with preference for dividends are the marginal investors in high-yield stocks, the price reaction to a dividend change should be larger, the higher the anticipated yield of the stock. An examination of over 8,500 dividend changes shows that price reactions to dividend increases are significantly more positive and to dividend decreases significantly more negative for high-yield stocks. Also, the price reactions to dividend changes are larger and the yield effect is stronger for low-priced and small-firm stocks, perhaps because of greater information content and higher transaction costs.","['Mukesh Bajaj', 'Anand M.

Equity valuation effects of forming master limited partnerships,"Equity valuation effects of decisions by corporations to shift assets to master limited partnerships (MLPs) are examined for the period 1982–1987. Positive average abnormal returns are found for (1) total conversions of corporations to MLPs (5.89%), (2) rollouts of subsets of assets by distribution of MLP equity claims to parent-firm shareholders (6.41%), and (3) rollouts of subsets of assets by public sale of MLP equity claims (2.41%). The positive effects are consistent with tax advantages, reduction in free cash flow, and information signaling. The positive effects for rollouts of subsets of assets are also consistent with reductions in information asymmetry and improvements in asset management.","['William T. Moore', 'Donald G.

Business conditions and expected returns on stocks and bonds,"Expected returns on common stocks and long-term bonds contain a term or maturity premium that has a clear business-cycle pattern (low near peaks, high near troughs). Expected returns also contain a risk premium that is related to longer-term aspects of business conditions. The variation through time in this premium is stronger for low-grade bonds than for high-grade bonds and stronger for stocks than for bonds. The general message is that expected returns are lower when economic conditions are strong and higher when conditions are weak.","['Eugene F. Fama', 'Kenneth R.

"Managerial performance, Tobin's Q, and the gains from successful tender offers","For a sample of successful tender offers, we find that the shareholders of high q bidders gain significantly more than the shareholders of low q bidders. In general, the shareholders of low q targets benefit more from takeovers than the shareholders of high q targets. Typical bidders have persistently low q ratios prior to the acquisition announcement while target q ratios decline significantly over the five years before the tender offer. Our results are consistent with the view that takeovers of poorly managed targets by well-managed bidders have higher bidder, target, and total gains.","['Larry H.P. Lang', 'RenéM. Stulz', 'Ralph A.

Campeau's acquisition of federated,"I analyze the acquisition of Federated Department Stores by Campeau Corporation and find that after the purchase the value of Federated assets increased by more than $1.8 billion. Federated and Campeau defaulted on the debt used to finance the acquisition because Campeau paid a premium of $3.4 billion for Federated, an overpayment of $1.6 billion, financed 97% of the purchase with debt, and did not have enough other assets to make up the shortfall. The Federated purchase illustrates that a highly leveraged transaction can increase value, but still not be able to make its debt payments.",['Steven N.

"Information disclosure, method of payment, and takeover premiums","In 1970, France introduced disclosure rules governing public tender offers without changing an existing four-week minimum offer period. We document a substantial increase in total offer premiums thereafter. Post-1970 premiums are also significantly higher in public than in private tender offers, where information disclosure is not required, and in all-cash than in all-stock offers. The impact of the payment method is evident in minority buyouts as well as in offers for voting control. The component of the total premium reflecting the value of the option to tender appears to be unaffected by either disclosure regulations or the payment method.","['B.Espen Eckbo', 'Herwig Langohr']",[],[],1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X89900524,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.3655552134493114,24,2,B.Espen Eckbo,1989,167.3626738836452

A critique of latent variable tests of asset pricing models,"Latent variable tests of asset pricing models make assumptions about the joint distribution of observable returns and unobservable benchmark returns. These tests can falsely accept models when a mean-variance efficient portfolio other than the benchmark satisfies the distributional assumptions imposed on the benchmark portfolio. Also, because the assumptions are untestable, there is no way to discover whether a model is being rejected because the assumptions are false.

Nonstationary expected returns,"Recent evidence reveals significant negative serial correlation in aggregate (market-wide) stock returns. We extend this result to relative (market-adjusted) returns, demonstrating negative serial correlation in five-year returns. We then test two competing explanations: (1) market mispricing and (2) changing expected returns in an efficient market. The tests are conducted using the capital asset pricing model to estimate relative returns. The evidence suggests that negative serial correlation in relative returns is due almost entirely to variation in relative risks, and therefore expected relative returns, through time. We document substantial relative risk shifts, particularly for extreme-performing stocks.","['Ray Ball', 'S.P.

Drawing inferences from statistics based on multiyear asset returns,Researchers investigating the possibility of mean reversion in stock prices with statistics based on multiyear returns have noted difficulties in drawing inferences from these statistics because the approximating asymptotic distributions perform poorly. We develop an alternative asymptotic distribution theory for statistics involving multiyear returns. These distributions differ markedly from those implied by the conventional theory. The alternative theory provides substantially better approximations to the relevant finite-sample distributions. It also leads to empirical inferences much less at odds with the hypothesis of no mean reversion.,"['Matthew Richardson', 'James H.

Forward and futures prices in a general equilibrium monetary model,"Risk premiums on dollar-denominated forward and futures contracts depend on risk attitudes, consumption parameters, and the stochastic structure of money and outputs. Pure monetary uncertainty leads to forward market backwardation; pure output uncertainty leads to contango under high risk aversion. Similar conclusions hold for futures contracts if neither money nor output show negative serial correlation. The conflicting effects of money and output shocks can imply that each contract switches between contango and backwardation, that one contract shows contango when the other shows backwardation, and that capital losses are expected on one contract when capital gains are expected on the other.","['Leslie Young', 'Glenn W.

The U.K. data allow independent tests of many issues addressed in studies of U.S. takeovers.

Managers' voting rights and corporate control,"We document managers' vote holdings in a large random sample of industrial firms, and test whether the degree of managerial control of shares affects how often a firm is the target of control events. The likelihood of successful acquisitions of firms is unrelated to managers' holdings. But this insignificant relation reflects two opposing effects. Lower managerial control is associated with a higher probability that a firm will receive a takeover offer, but a lower probability that a takeover attempt will lead to a change in control.","['Wayne H.

"A Markov model of heteroskedasticity, risk, and learning in the stock market","We examine a variety of models in which the variance of a portfolio's excess return depends on a state variable generated by a first-order Markov process. A model in which the state is known to economic agents is estimated. It suggests that the mean excess return moves inversely with the level of risk. We then estimate a model in which agents are uncertain of the state. The estimates indicate that agents are consistently surprised by high-variance periods, so there is a negative correlation between movements in volatility and in excess returns.","['Christopher M.

Trader rationality in the exercise of futures options,"We examine the rationality of investor exercise behavior by analyzing two years' tendered exercise notices for Treasury bond futures options. We conclude that exercise behavior is generally rational, but document numerous failures to exercise as well as some exercises that should not have occured, both at and prior to expiration. The most frequent type of error is failing to exercise, suggesting that traders do not monitor their positions with sufficient care. Finally, we show that investors use information arriving after trading closes, but before exchange-imposed exercise deadlines, in forming their exercise decisions.","['Gerald D Gay', 'Robert W Kolb', 'Kenneth Yung']",[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X89900627,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.3655552134493114,23,2,Gerald D Gay,1989,167.3626738836452

The analysis yields a number of empirical implications, including that new issues will be underpriced and that distributional priority will be given to an underwriter's regular investors.

Delaying the call benefits the firm if enough investors are expected to delay their voluntary conversions. Consistent with this theory, we document that a substantial number of investors do not voluntarily convert when the common dividend exceeds the convertible's dividend plus its premium over conversion value.

Dividend yields and expected stock returns,"The power of dividend yields to forecast stock returns, measured by regression R2, increases with the return horizon. We offer a two-part explanation. (1) High autocorrelation causes the variance of expected returns to grow faster than the return horizon. (2) The growth of the variance of unexpected returns with the return horizon is attenuated by a discount-rate effect - shocks to expected returns generate opposite shocks to current prices. We estimate that, on average, the future price increases implied by higher expected returns are just offset by the decline in the current price. Thus, time-varying expected returns generate ‘temporary’ components of prices.","['Eugene F. Fama', 'Kenneth R.

Corporate payout policy,"Theories of corporate payout policy do not explain the observed form of distributions to shareholders. Although open-market repurchases appear to have tax advantages, cash dividends are overwhelmingly chosen.

We offer evidence suggesting that bid-ask spreads widen around repurchase announcements, as predicted by our analysis. Since these costs of repurchases do not arise with cash dividends, our analysis implies that repurchases do not dominate cash dividends for making distributions to shareholders.","['Michael J.

On correlations and inferences about mean-variance efficiency,"A framework is presented for investigating the mean-variance efficiency of an unobservable portfolio based on its correlation with a proxy portfolio. A sensitivity analysis derives the highest correlation between the proxy and a portfolio that reverses the inference of a test of SHarpe-Lintner tangency. For example, the maximum correlation between the value-weighted NYSE-AMEX portfolio and a portfolio inferred tangent ranges from 0.76 to 0.48. We also test whether the correlation between the proxy and the tangent portfolio exceeds a given level. This hypothesis is often rejected for the NYSE-AMEX proxy at a correlation of 0.7.","['Shmuel Kandel', 'Robert F.

"Target abnormal returns associated with acquisition announcements: Payment, acquisition form, and managerial resistance","Abnormal returns earned by target firms at the time of initial acquisition announcements are related to form of payment, degree of resistance, and type of offer. Results indicate that interdependence among these characteristics is important. Previous research suggests that tender-offer targets earn higher abnormal returns than merger targets. After controlling for payment method and degree of resistance, however, the difference in abnormal returns between tender offers and mergers is insignificant. Resisted offers are associated with insignificantly higher returns than unresisted offers. Abnormal returns associated with cash offers are significantly higher than those associated with stock offers.","['Yen-Sheng Huang', 'Ralph A.

Firm value and seasoned equity issues,"Announcements of new equity issues have been seen to have a negative effect on stock prices. Potential explanations of this negative effect - the price-pressure, wealth-redistribution, and information-release hypotheses - imply different bond-price reactions to the announcements. By investigating bond-price behavior around the announcement of new equity issues this paper distinguishes the relative importance of these hypotheses. The evidence presented of a significant drop in bond prices is consistent with the information-release hypotheses.","['Avner Kalay', 'Adam Shimrat']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X87900316,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.533871782669246,19,1,Avner Kalay,1987,167.19438562433535
Shark repellents and stock prices,"Antitakeover amendments (shark repellents) restrict the transfer of corporate control.

However, different types of amendments have varying effects. Non-fair-price amendments have an average significant negative effect of 2.95% on share prices, while fair-price amendments have an insignificant effect.

Non-stationarity and stage-of-the-business-cycle effects in consumption-based asset pricing relations,"Empirical tests of Euler equations relating security returns and consumption usually appear to reject the model. Using a common specification of aggregate preferences and instrumental variables, this paper examines some potential reasons for rejections. The evidence indicates that maintained stationarity assumptions of previous tests fail for post-war U.S. quarterly and monthly data. Shifts in model parameters are found across policy regimes (pre-1951 and post-1979) and across stages of the business cycle (recession versus non-recession). Controlling for some of these factors, less evidence is found against a simple consumption-based asset pricing model in non-recession periods.","['Wayne E. Ferson', 'John J.

The monotonicity of the term premium,"Fama's evidence that the term premium on Treasury securities is not monotonically increasing is found to depend entirely on the behavior of bid-asked mean returns on 9- and 10-month bills, and only during the subperiod 8/64–12/72. When transactions costs, as reflected in the bid-asked spread, are taken into account, there is found to be no way to exploit this non-monotonicity. The anomalous behavior of the quotations is attributed to the Treasury's auctions of 9-month bills during the period 9/66–10/72.

Stock returns and the term structure,"In monthly U.S. data for 1959–1979 and 1979–1983, the state of the term structure of interest rates predicts excess stock returns, as well as excess returns on bills and bonds. This paper documents this fact and uses it to examine some simple asset pricing models. In 1959–1979, the data strongly reject a single-latent-variable specification of predictable excess returns. There is considerable evidence that conditional variances of excess returns change through time, but the relationship between conditional mean and conditional variance is reliably positive only at the short end of the term structure.",['John Y.

An empirical analysis of the incentives to engage in costly information acquisition,"In order for security prices to be informationally efficient, incentives must exist for traders to engage in costly information acquisition. This paper provides empirical evidence on this proposition. We observe that risk arbitrageurs (i.e., market participants who trade in securities of firms that are involved in mergers, tender offers, and voluntary liquidations) are able to generate private information regarding the success or failure of corporate reorganizations. Moreover, risk arbitrageurs earn substantial returns on their trading activities. These results suggest that security prices are sufficiently noisy to create incentives for costly information acquisition.","['David F.

"Time to build, option value, and investment decisions","Investment decisions and outlays are often made sequentially. For example, the rate at which construction proceeds is usually flexible and can be adjusted with the arrival of new information. Traditional discounted cash flow methods which treat the pattern of investment as fixed ignore this flexibility and understate the value of the project. This paper uses contingent claims analysis to derive optimal decision rules and to value such investments. We determine the effects of time to build, opportunity cost and uncertainty on the investment decision. For reasonable parameter values, we show how a simple NPV rule can lead to gross errors.","['Saman Majd', 'Robert S.

Coincidentally, aggregate corporate earnings news arriving at the market during these half-month periods tends to be good, whereas earnings reports arriving later are more likely to convey bad news.

These findings suggest that the liquidating firms' assets have been underutilized before liquidation and that voluntary liquidations lead to higher-valued reallocations of corporate resources.","['E.Han Kim', 'John D.

Constraints on short-selling and asset price adjustment to private information,"This paper models effects of short-sale constraints on the speed of adjustment (to private information) of security prices. Constraints eliminate some informative trades, but do not bias prices upward. Prohibiting traders from shorting reduces the adjustment speed of prices to private information, especially to bad news. Non-prohibitive costs can have the reverse effect, but this is unlikely. Implications are developed about return distributions on information announcement dates.

Subperiod aggregation and the power of multivariate tests of portfolio efficiency,"When testing portfolio efficiency, empiricists usually perform tests using subperiods and aggregate the results in some manner. Although the power of individual subperiod tests has been studied previously, little is known about the power of the aggregate test. Power is evaluated here through simulations using two different aggregation techniques. Aggregate power is substantially higher than that for a single subperiod. For example, in one scenario the aggregate power is 0.77 over a sixty-year period, but only 0.17 for each five-year subperiod. In addition, the level of power depends on the method of aggregation.","['Michael R.

The valuation of floating-rate instruments,"A framework for valuing floating-rate notes is developed to examine the effects of (1) lags in the coupon formula, (2) special contractual features and (3) default risk. Evidence from a sample of floaters indicates they sold at significant discounts. While lags in the coupon formulas and other contractual features make these notes more variable, they do not account for the magnitude of the discounts. We conclude that the fixed default premium in the coupon formula of a typical note is inadequate to compensate for time-varying default premiums demanded by investors, who treat other corporate short-term paper as close substitutes.","['Krishna Ramaswamy', 'Suresh M.

Statistical tests of contingent-claims asset-pricing models,"A new methodology for statistically testing contingent-claims asset-pricing models based on asymptotic statistical theory is proposed. It is introduced in the context of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, for which some illustrative estimation, inference, and simulation results are also presented.

Stock return variances,"Asset prices are much more volatile during exchange trading hours than during non-trading hours. This paper considers three explanations for this phenomenon: (1) volatility is caused by public information which is more likely to arrive during normal business hours; (2) volatility is caused by private information which affects prices when informed investors trade; and (3) volatility is caused by pricing errors that occur during trading. Although a significant fraction of the daily variance is caused by mispricing, the behavior of returns around exchange holidays suggests that private information is the principle factor behind high trading-time variances.","['Kenneth R.

The differences are also partially explained by proxies for underlying firm characteristics that could create interaction between unexpected inflation and operating profitability. Finally, much if not most of the differences appear to arise because unexpected inflation is correlated with changes in expected aggregate real activity, the effects of which tend to vary across firms according to their systematic risk.",['Victor L.

When production functions are concave, markets are complete, and future production possibilities are the same irrespective of which state of the world occurs, the term structure premium will be positive.

Both the durability of goods and the non-separability of preferences are important factors in explaining the time paths of individual returns, but there is substantial evidence against the cross-sectional restrictions implied by our model.

We demonstrate that there is a monotone relation between the (expected) underpricing of an initial public offering and the uncertainty of investors regarding its value. We also argue that the resulting underpricing equilibrium is enforced by investment bankers, who have reputation capital at stake. An investment banker who ‘cheats’ on this underpricing equilibrium will lose either potential investors (if it doesn't underprice enough) or issuers (if it underprices too much), and thus forfeit the value of its reputation capital.

Combination offerings involving decreases in management shareholdings exhibit significantly larger negative announcement effects. Cross-sectional analysis of stock announcement returns indicates a positive relationship to firms' leverage changes, and a negative relationship to prior stock returns and (for industrials) to decreases in management shareholdings.","['Ronald W.

Day-of-the-week and intraday effects in stock returns,"This study examines day-of-the-week effects using hourly values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We find that over the 1963–1983 period the weekend effect has sifted from characterizing active trading on Monday to characterizing the non-trading weekend. Over the early part of our sample period negative returns characterize each hour of trading on Monday, while the return from Friday close to Monday open is positive. In the most recent subperiod, Monday average hourly returns after noon are all positive and the weekend effect is due to negative average returns from Friday close to Monday open.","['Michael Smirlock', 'Laura Starks']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X86900115,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.6180300672792134,17,1,Michael Smirlock,1986,167.11024149468042
Valuation effects of security offerings and the issuance process,"This study examines the stock price effects of security offerings and investigates the nature of information inferred by investors from offering announcements. Changes in share price are unrelated to characteristics of offerings such as the net amount of new financing, relative offering size, and the quality rating of debt issues. The type of security is the only significant determinant of the price response. The opposite patterns of abnormal stock returns following the announcement of completed versus cancelled offerings suggest that managers issue common stock or convertible debt when in managers' view shares are overpriced.","['Wayne H.

The valuation of American call options and the expected ex-dividend stock price decline,"This study focuses on the ex-dividend stock price decline implicit within the valuation of American call options on dividend-paying stocks. The Roll (1977) American call option pricing formula and the observed structure of CBOE call option transaction prices are used to infer the expected ex-dividend stock price decline as a proportion of the amount of the dividend. The relative decline is shown to be not meaningfully different from one, confirming some recent evidence from studies which examined stock prices in the days surrounding ex-dividend.","['Giovanni Barone-Adesi', 'Robert E.

Equity issues and offering dilution,"This study investigates the effect on stock prices of seasoned equity offerings. The results demonstrate that the announcement of equity offerings reduces stock prices significantly. For industrial issues, regression results indicate that announcement day price reduction is significantly and negatively related to the size of the equity offering. The results appear not to be explained by changes in capital structure associated with the equity offerings. The findings are consistent both with the hypothesis that equity issues are viewed by investors as negative signals and with the hypothesis that there is a downward sloping demand for a firm's shares.","['Paul Asquith', 'David W.

Event study methodologies and the size effect,"This study of 862 press recommendations demonstrates that the size effect can distort longer-term performance measures, and hence event studies. Relative to similar sized companies, post-publication performance is neutral. However, market adjustments, the CAPM and Market Model, with equally or capitalization weighted indexes, all produce biased results. Event studies are most exposed to such bias when the measurement interval is long, event securities differ systematically in size or weighting from the index constituents, the size effect is large and/or volatile, and when CAPM-type methodologies are used. These distortions are avoided by explicitly controlling for size.","['Elroy Dimson', 'Paul Marsh']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X86900085,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.6180300672792134,17,1,Elroy Dimson,1986,167.11024149468042
Return seasonality and tax-loss selling in the market for long-term government and corporate bonds,"We document a January seasonal in the U.S. market for long-term corporate bonds that becomes more evident as the bond rating declines. Moreover, a similar, but weaker, relation is observed for the stocks of firms with low-quality bonds.

Ownership structure and control,"We examine an unusual sample of firms within the life insurance industry: 30 firms which switched from a common-stock to a mutual-ownership structure. Our evidence indicates that the rate of growth of premium income from policyholders remains unchanged, stockholders receive a premium for their stock, and management turnover declines; thus, no group of claimholders systematically loses in the sample of firms which choose to go through the mutualization process.

"Non-trading, market making, and estimates of stock price volatility","We examine the effects of market making and intermittent trading on estimates of stock price volatility. When observed price changes are correctly tied to a stock's true price dynamics, it is found that non-trading per se causes a loss of efficiency but no bias in traditional volatility estimates. Non-trading induces substancial inefficiency in the extreme value estimator of volatility which it biases downward. Market making's effects add to the non-trading induced inefficiency in the traditional estimator, while information trading causes a downward bias, and liquidity trading a potentially removable upward bias, in that estimator.","['Terry A.

A test of dividend irrelevance using volume reactions to a change in dividend policy,We investigate the implication of clientele theories that changes in dividend policy should result in a marked increase in trading volume as shareholder clienteles change. With 192 firms announcing their first cash dividend we document both an increase in trading volume and firm value around the announcement date. We integrate these results to distinguish between the volume response to good news about the future and clientele adjustments to a change in dividend policy. Our results suggest that volume increases primarily in response to the signal about future earnings contained in the dividend. Clientele adjustments are small.,"['Gordon Richardson', 'Stephan E.

For all firms, significant weekday differences in intraday returns accrue during the first 45 minutes after the market opens.

The investors' activities in target firms for the two years following the initial stock purchase are likewise inconsistent with ‘raiding’. We discuss two hypotheses that are consistent with the evidence: first, these investors improve the management of target firms; second, they are systematically able to identify under-priced stocks.","['Clifford G.

The results suggest that (1) equity-based compensation schemes have a positive effect on shareholder wealth for reasons other than tax reduction, (2) a motive for adopting these plans is to align managerial and shareholder interests, and (3) equity ownership motivates key executives more than subordinate employees.","['Sanjai Bhagat', 'James A.

Dividend yields and stock returns: Implications of abnormal January returns,"This study examines the empirical relation between stock returns and (long-run) dividend yields. The findings show that much of the phenomenon is due to a nonlinear relation between dividend yields and returns in January. Regression coefficients on dividend yields, which some models predict should be non-zero due to differential taxation of dividends and capital gains, exhibit a significant January seasonal, even when controlling for size. This finding is significant since there are no provisions in the after-tax asset pricing models that predict the tax differential is more important in January than in other months.",['Donald B.

Market rationality and dividend announcements,"We investigate stock market rationality by examining the timeliness and unbiasedness of the market's response to dividend announcements. Our initial findings for market timeliness show a sluggish market reaction to dividend announcements; however, when the ex-dividend effect is controlled for, we find no evidence of a sluggish market reaction. We examine the unbiasedness of the market's response by testing whether the net announcement effect across a sample that is devoid of ex-post selection bias sums to zero. We observe a significant positive net announcement effect and examine several plausible conjectures for this puzzling phenomenon, but none provides a satisfactory explanation.","['Kenneth M.

An exploratory investigation of the firm size effect,"We investigate the firm size effect for the period 1958 to 1977 in the framework of a multi-factor pricing model. The risk-adjusted difference in returns between the top five percent and the bottom five percent of the NYSE firms is about one to two percent a year, a drop from about twelve percent per year before risk adjustment. The variable most responsible for the adjustment is the sensitivity of asset returns to the changing risk premium, measured by the return difference between low-grade bonds and long-term government bonds.","['K.C.

Testing asset pricing models with changing expectations and an unobservable market portfolio,"When the assumption of constant risk premiums is relaxed, financial valuation models may be tested, and risk measures estimated without specifying a market index or state variables. This is accomplished by examining the behavior of conditional expected returns. The approach is developed using a single risk premium asset pricing model as an example and then extended to models with multiple risk premiums. The methodology is illustrated using daily return data on the common stocks of the Dow Jones 30.

The effect of capital structure on a firm's liquidation decision,"A firm's liquidation can impose costs on its customers, workers, and suppliers. An agency relationship between these individuals and the firm exists in that the liquidation decision controlled by the firm (as the agent) affects other individuals (the customers, workers, and suppliers as principals).

The weekend effect on the distribution of stock prices,"Evidence of weekend effects on the distribution of security returns suggests that returns are generated by a process operating closer to trading time rather than calendar time. In contrast, accumulation of interest over the weekend follows a calendar-time process.

On interpreting security returns during the ex-dividend period,"In this paper we examine the ex-dividend day returns of several taxable and non-taxable distributions. The ex-dividend day returns for the taxable common stocks are consistent with the hypothesis that dividends are taxed more heavily than capital gains. However, the ex-dividend day returns of preferred stocks suggest that preferred dividends are taxed at a lower rate than capital gains; non-taxable stock dividends and splits are priced on ex-dividend days as if they are fully taxable; and non-taxable cash distributions are priced as if investors receive a tax rebate with them. We also find that each of these distributions exhibits abnormal return behavior for several days surrounding the ex-dividend day.

Call options and the risk of underlying securities,"Merton (1973) in his seminal article ‘Theory of Rational Option Pricing’ showed that the rationally determined price of a call option is a non-decreasing function of the ‘riskness’ of its associated common stock. In deriving his results, Merton made restrictive assumptions about the way the market prices payoff distributions, and used the Rothschild-Stiglitz (1970) measure to compare the riskiness of securities. I show by means of an example that the Merton result will not in general be true.

Moreover, closed-end fund share prices begin to generate statistically significant positive abnormal returns well in advance of the formal announcement of the open-ending.

Wealth redistributions or changes in firm value,"Past studies indicate that stock prices are affected by announcements of unexpected dividend changes, i.e., unexpectedly large dividends are associated with positive stock price response. Two explanations of this empirical regularity, ‘the information content hypothesis’ and the ‘wealth redistribution hypothesis’, imply different bond price behavior around dividend announcements. The information content hypothesis predicts a positive bond price response to unexpectedly large dividends, while the wealth redistribution hypothesis predicts the opposite. This paper distinguishes between the relative importance of the two hypotheses by empirically investigating bond price behavior around dividend announcements. The evidence presented is consistent with the information content hypothesis. However, the gains associated with positive information are captured by the stockholders, while the losses are shared with the bondholders.","['George Handjinicolaou', 'Avner Kalay']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8490031X,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.7863466364991478,13,1,George Handjinicolaou,1984,166.9419532353706

Our theory and simulation over the 1962–1977 period establish that taxable investors should realize long term gains in high variance stocks and repurchase stock in order to realize potential future losses short term.

Corporate financing and investment decisions when firms have information that investors do not have,"This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity. Management is assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally. An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required.

Both estimation methods indicate that expected returns on bills tend to peak at eight or nine months and never increase monotonically out to twelve months.

The intraday speed of adjustment of stock prices to earnings and dividend announcements,"This paper examines the effects of Broad Tape news releases of earnings and dividend announcements on three aspects of intraday stock price behavior: mean returns, return variance, and serial correlation in consecutive price changes. The initial price reaction is evident in the first pair of price changes following the release (i.e., within a few minutes, at most). The returns earned by simple trading rules dissipate within five to ten minutes, although significant returns are detected in the overnight period and at the opening of trading on the next day. Disturbances in the variance and serial correlation persist for several hours and extend into the following trading day. As a class, dividend announcements induce much less activity than do earnings, although the response to dividend changes is comparable to the earnings announcement effect.","['James M.

"Convertible debt issuance, capital structure change and financing-related information","This paper provides evidence on the valuation effects of convertible debt issuance. Common stockholders earn significant negative abnormal returns at the initial announcement of a convertible debt offering, and also at the issuance date. In contrast, the average valuation effect on common stock at the announcement of non-convertible debt offerings is only marginally negative, and is zero at issuance. The significant negative average effect on common stock value appears not to be systematically related to either the degree of leverage change induced by the convertible debt issuance or the extent to which the proceeds from issuance are used for new investment or to refinance existing debt. If, as appears likely, the issuance of convertible debt on average increases financial leverage, these results are inconsistent with evidence from other recent studies documenting common stock price effects of the same sign as the change in leverage. The evidence suggests that convertible debt offerings convey unfavorable information about the issuing firms, but the specific nature of such information remains unidentified.","['Larry Y.

As a result of low levels of trading and the regulations governing exchange specialists, transaction prices and quotations of small listed companies may require several days to fully reflect equilibrium price changes.

Stock return seasonalities and the tax-loss selling hypothesis,"A ‘tax-loss selling’ hypothesis has frequently been advanced to explain the ‘January effect’ reported in this issue by Keim. This paper concludes that U.S. tax laws do not unambiguously predict such an effect. Since Australia has similar tax laws but a July–June tax year, the hypothesis predicts a small-firm July premium. Australian returns show pronounced December–January and July–August seasonals, and a premium for the smallest-firm decile of about four percent per month across all months. This contrasts with the U.S. data in which the small-firm premium is concentrated in January. We conclude that the relation between the U.S. tax year and the January seasonal may be more correlation than causation.","['Philip Brown', 'Donald B. Keim', 'Allan W. Kleidon', 'Terry A.

Examining antitrust policy towards horizontal mergers,"A horizontal merger must result in higher product prizes to consumers to be anticompetitive or socially inefficient. Higher product prices, however, imply increased profits for rivals to the merging firms. Therefore, if a horizontal merger is to reduce consumer welfare, rival firms must rise in value at the time of events increasing the probability of the merger and fall in value when the probability of the merger declines. this paper uses daily stock return data from a sample of rivals to 11 horizontal mergers attempted between 1964 and 1972 that were challenged by the antitrust enforcement agencies. The paper tests the hypothesis that, but for the government's action, these mergers would have resulted in higher product prices.

A number of individuals and institutions have onjected to such amendments on the grounds that they are not in the best interests of the shareholders of the firms that adopt them. This paper employs event-time methodology to investigate the impact of antitakeover amendments on the common stock prices of firms that adopt them.

Antitakeover charter amendments and stockholder wealth,"Many large corporations have recently adopted antitakeover charter amendments which make the transfer of corporate control more difficult. This paper develops and tests competing theoretical explanations for the passage of these amendments. In one view, antitakeover provisions are adopted because incumbent management seeks job protection at stockholders' expense. The alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover provisions benefit stockholders, perhaps by extracting greater payment in exchange for corporate control. Although inconclusive, the evidence provides weak preliminary support for the hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are best explained as a device for managerial entrenchment.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Edward M.

The effect of pre-emptive right amendments on shareholder wealth,"Pre-emptive rights allow existing shareholders to purchase a new offering of shares before the general public. This paper investigates the effect on shareholder wealth of removing pre-emptive rights from corporate charters. Two hypotheses are constrasted: (1) Shareholder wealth maximization suggests that management uses this extra degree of freedom to pick the least cost method for raising new equity; hence, the amendment increases shareholder wealth. (2) Management welfare maximization holds that management will use the passage of the amendment to maximize their own welfare, sometimes to the detriment of shareholders; hence, the amendment decreases shareholder wealth. The evidence indicates that the amendment decreases shareholder wealth.",['Sanjai Bhagat'],[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8390051X,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.8705049211091151,12,3,Sanjai Bhagat,1983,166.85780910571566
Biases in computed returns,"Previous estimates of a ‘size effect’ based on daily returns data are biased. The use of quoted closing prices in computing returns on individual stocks imparts an upward bias. Returns computed for buy-and-hold portfolios largely avoid the bias induced by closing prices.

Factor pricing in a finite economy,"Prior theoretical derivations of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) bound an aggregate measure of the deviation of mean asset returns from that predicted by a linear pricing equation. It is conceivable, given this bound, that some assets might be badly mispriced by the model. In this paper, a more intuitive derivation of the factor pricing equation is presented which describes the deviation on an asset by asset basis. The deviation is shown to be small for assets in a realistic finite economy and is arbitrarily close to zero for those assets with arbitrarily small size relative to aggregate wealth. It follows that the linear pricing equation provides a good approximation for the mean returns of all traded assets.","['Mark Grinblatt', 'Sheridan Titman']",[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900466,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.8705049211091151,12,4,Mark Grinblatt,1983,166.85780910571566

Assessing competition in the market for corporate acquisitions,"Several studies of mergers and tender offers examine the changes in the value of ownership claims associated with corporate acquisitions and use the observed value changes to address the degree of competition in the market for corporate acquisitions. These studies conclude that the takeover market is competitive on the basis of the abnormal stock price changes of bidding firms, the time series behavior of the market value of target firms, and the proportion of gains that accrue to target and bidding firms. Unfortunately, none of these tests are sufficient to conclude that the takeover market is competitive. A competitive acquisition market implies that the potential gain to unsuccessful bidders at the successful offer price is nonpositive. This implication is tested using data on tender offers in which there are multiple bidders.

"Standstill agreements, privately negotiated stock repurchases, and the market for corporate control","Standstill agreements are voluntary contracts which limit a substantial stockholder's ownership interest in a corporation for a specified number of years. They are often accompanied by repurchase of the substantial stockholder's shares at a premium above the market price. Standstills and premium buybacks reduce competition for corporate control and provide differential treatment of large block stockholders. The analysis indicates a statistically significant negative average effect on non-participating stockholder wealth associated with standstill agreements.

On the other hand, while the common stock of small NYSE firms appear to have earned substantially higher returns than the common stock of large NYSE firms, the size effect virtually disappears when returns are controlled for differences in risk and E/P ratios.

"Banks, firms and the relative pricing of tax-exempt and taxable bonds",The traditional analysis of the relative pricing of tax-exempt and taxable debt is a habitat theory of the term structure of interest rates. In the traditional analysis the preferences of investors for particular maturities of debt lead to unique pricing relations at every point on the yield curve which are indicative of investor marginal tax brackets. Recent work by Fama (1977) suggests that banks are potential arbitrageurs across tax-exempt and taxable bond markets which force a particular equilibrium on the pricing of short-term bonds. Miller (1977) suggests that the choice of debt or equity financing by firms in the aggregate forces a similar equilibrium on the pricing of all tax-exempt and taxable bonds. This paper exploits the institution of Regulation Q and its effects on the banking system to bring evidence to bear on the predictions of these three models.,['Jeffrey L.

Friction in the trading process and the estimation of systematic risk,"This paper considers how estimates of the market model beta parameter can be biased by friction in the trading process (information, decision, and transaction costs) that (a) leads to a distinction between observed and ‘true’ returns; (b) causes observed returns to be generated asynchronously for a set of interdependent securities; and (c) thereby introduces serial cross-correlation into security returns. Several propositions are derived from which consistent estimators of beta are obtained, and the effect of differencing interval length on beta estimates is specified.

On corporate governance,"This paper examines a sample of firms experiencing proxy contests for seats on their board of directors. Dissident shareholders usually fail to obtain a majority of board seats. Nevertheless, they capture some seats, via mechanisms such as cumulative voting, in over half of the sample contests. Regardless of proxy contest outcome, positive and statistically significant share price performance is associated with the contest. That finding is predicted by the standard economic analysis of proxy contests, in which the challenges benefit shareholders by improving corporate performance. The finding runs counter to the claim of Berle (1962) that the economists' view of proxy contests is ‘a wholly imaginary picture’. A portion of the positive share price changes taking place in the early stages of some proxy contests is not permanent, however, and as suggested by Manne (1962) is at least partially attributable to temporary increases in the market value of the vote attached to corporate shares.","['Peter Dodd', 'Jerold B.

The wealth effects of targeted share repurchases,"This paper examines the wealth impact of share repurchases that restrict participation to a particular sub-set of a firm's stockholders. Repurchases at a premium from insiders and small shareholders increase the wealth of non-participating stockholders and are therefore consistent with the shareholders' interest hypothesis. However, privately negotiated repurchases of single blocks from stockholders unaffiliated with the firm reduce the wealth of non-participating stockholders. In contrast to the evidence for general repurchases, no positive wealth effect offsets the significant repurchase premium paid to the selling stockholder. Indeed, the wealth loss to non-participating stockholders is significantly greater than the premium paid. This evidence is inconsistent with the shareholders' interest hypothesis and supports the hypothesis that managers in their self-interest use single block repurchases to eliminate threats to their control over the firm's resources.","['Michael Bradley', 'L.Macdonald Wakeman']",[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900156,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.8705049211091151,11,1,Michael Bradley,1983,166.85780910571566

The rationale behind interfirm tender offers,"This paper investigates the rationale behind interfirm tender offers by examining the returns realized by the stockholders of firms that were the targets of unsuccessful tender offers and firms that have made unsuccessful offers. Our results suggest that the permanent positive revaluation of the unsuccessful target shares [documented by Dodd and Ruback (1977) and Bradley (1980)] is due primarily to the emergence of and/or the anticipation of another bid that would ultimately result in the transfer of control of the target resources. We also find that the rejection of a tender offer has differential effects on the share prices of the unsuccessful bidding firms depending upon whether the tender offer process results in a change in the control of target resources. On the basis of these results we conclude that acquisitions via tender offers are attempts by bidding firms to exploit potential synergies, not simply superior information regarding the ‘true’ value of the target resources.","['Michael Bradley', 'Anand Desai', 'E.Han Kim']",[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900107,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.8705049211091151,11,1,Michael Bradley,1983,166.85780910571566

We find that the size effect is linear in the logarithm of size, but reject the hypothesis that the ex ante excess return attributable to size is stable through time. We briefly analyze the Seemingly Unrelated Regression Model (SURM) and a two-step procedure as two alternative estimators of the size effect. Due to the instability of the effect, we find that the estimates are sensitive to the time period studied.","['Philip Brown', 'Allan W. Kleidon', 'Terry A.

These efficiency tests attempt to closely approximate conditions in the option markets to avoid the pitfalls indicated by Phillips and Smith (1980). The tests use transactions data and account for the effects of stock and option bid/ask prices, simultaneity of stock and option prices, depth of market, execution lag and transaction costs. The small and relatively infrequent profits due to market mispricing disappear in the lower boundary tests when transaction costs are taken into account. Frequent violations of the tighter boundary conditions in the implied standard deviation test are reported, but the estimated profits cannot be unambiguously attributed to option market inefficiency.",['Mihir Bhattacharya'],[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8390034X,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.8705049211091151,12,2,Mihir Bhattacharya,1983,166.85780910571566

Previous research on this subject suggests that defendants' case-related losses are due entirely to legal expenses and the disruption of productive activity. In this paper it is shown that two out of five portfolios of defendant firms earn abnormal losses when final decisions in antimerger cases are announced. These losses are consistent with the imposition of costly constraints on some defendants by government antitrust enforcers. The tests also show that when acquisitions are canceled following antimerger complaints, the losses to the target firms are substantial and completely offset the gains generated when the acquisitions are proposed.",['Peggy Wier'],[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900119,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.8705049211091151,11,1,Peggy Wier,1983,166.85780910571566

With the exception of actions that exclude potential bidders, it is difficult to find managerial actions related to corporate control that harm shareholders.

The wealth effect of merger activity and the objective functions of merging firms,"This paper studies the net effects of the long-run sequence of events leading to merger, and of merger per se, on shareholder wealth. The appropriate measure of the wealth effect is shown to be the abnormal dollar return cumulated over time. Using this measure, the long-run wealth effect of the event sequence culminating in merger is significantly negative for acquiring firms. For acquired firms, the effect is negative, but not significant. The immediate impact of merger per se is positive and highly significant for acquired firms but larger in absolute value, and negative for acquiring firms. The evidence also reveals that measured abnormal rates of return to acquiring firms are sensitive to a slight variation in model specification and dependent on firm size, with smaller firms earning significantly negative post-merger returns.",['Paul H.

"Horizontal mergers, collusion, and stockholder wealth","This paper tests the hypothesis that horizontal mergers generate positive abnormal returns to stockholders of the bidder and target firms because they increase the probability of successful collusion among rival producers. Under the collusion hypothesis, rivals of the merging firms benefit from the merger since successful collusion limits output and raises product prices and/or lower factor prices. This proposition is tested on a large sample of horizontal mergers in mining and manufacturing industries, including mergers challenged by the government with violating antitrust laws, and a ‘control’ sample of vertical mergers taking place in the same industries. While we find that the antitrust law enforcement agencies systematically select relatively profitable mergers for prosecution, there is little evidence indicating that the mergers would have had collusive, anticompetitive effects.",['B.Espen Eckbo'],[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900132,Journal of Financial Economics,-1.8705049211091151,11,1,B.Espen Eckbo,1983,166.85780910571566

However, in four firms where the ownership structure of the firm also included a class of voting preferred stock, the class of common with superior voting rights traded at a significant discount relative to the class of common with inferior voting rights.

The gains to bidding firms from merger,"This study examines the effect of mergers on the wealth of bidding firms' shareholders. Bidding firms gain significantly during the twenty-one days leading to the announcement of each of their first four merger bids. These results fail to support the capitalization hypothesis that bidders' gains are captured at the beginning of merger programs. Bidders' abnormal returns are positively related to the relative size of the merger partners, and the gains during the announcement period are larger for mergers which are successful. Though the gains are larger prior to 1969, merger bids after 1969 also significantly increase the wealth of bidding firms' shareholders. The results suggest that the inconclusive findings of the earlier studies may be due to methodological deficiencies. The findings of this study are consistent with value-maximizing behavior by the management of bidding firms.","['Paul Asquith', 'Robert F. Bruner', 'David W.

Size-related anomalies and stock return seasonality,"This study examines, month-by-month, the empirical relation between abnormal returns and market value of NYSE and AMEX common stocks. Evidence is provided that daily abnormal return distributions in January have large means relative to the remaining eleven months, and that the relation between abnormal returns and size is always negative and more pronounced in January than in any other month — even in years when, on average, large firms earn larger risk-adjusted returns than small firms. In particular, nearly fifty percent of the average magnitude of the ‘size effect’ over the period 1963–1979 is due to January abnormal returns. Further, more than fifty percent of the January premium is attributable to large abnormal returns during the first week of trading in the year, particularly on the first trading day.",['Donald B.

Security price reactions around corporate spin-off announcements,We examine security price reactions around the announcements of 123 voluntary spin-offs by 116 firms between 1963 and 1981 involving a pro-rata distribution of the common stock of a subsidiary to the stockholders of the parent firm. The median spin-off in the sample is 6.6% of the original equity value and is associated with an abnormal return of 7.0% from 50 days prior to the announcement through completion of the spin-off. No evidence is found to indicate the gains to stockholders represent wealth transfers from senior securityholders. Over the entire event period we find positive gains for firms engaging in spin-offs to facilitate mergers or to separate diverse operating units but negative returns to firms responding to legal and/or regulatory difficulties. In the two-day interval surrounding the first press announcement we find positive average excess returns for all groups.,"['Gailen L. Hite', 'James E.

Our results support the hypotheses that acquisitions activity had a favorable ex ante impact on the value of firms announcing an intention to engage in acquisitions, and that some of the institutional changes reduced the expected profitability of future acquisitions activity.

(2) Do horses go off at odds that reflect their true probability of winning? (3) Is there any evidence that late bettors have better information than early bettors? It is found that market odds predict the order of finish well, but that ‘favorites’ are good bets and ‘long shots’ are poor ones.

The effect of temporal risk aversion on liquidity preference,"In most instances, investors are not indifferent to risk. Their attitudes toward it influence their decisions. Temporal risk aversion, the dynamic analogue of the usual concept of risk aversion, has a marked effect on investors' decisions but is usually ignored in the literature. This paper investigates the liquidity preference of temporally risk-averse investors. The analysis shows that, all other things being equal, temporal risk aversion reduces the liquidity premium investors must receive to hold an asset that is not perfectly reversible. Thus, the optimal investment policy is closer to what one would expect had a frictionless exchange market existed for the irreversible asset. As far as an individual's investment behavior is concerned, temporal risk aversion counters the effects of an asset's irreversibility and tends to compensate for the absence of frictionless exchange.",['Gyorgy G.

In this study, the fact that the macro-economic effect of wage and price controls is the aggregation of the micro-economic effects is used to implement a different approach to measure the effects of price controls. The effect of price controls is inferred from examining the impact of discretionary regulatory decisions on the equity values of individual firms during Phase II of Nixon's Economic Stabilization Program.

This study, using a very large sample of stocks and daily returns, represents the most complete and detailed analysis of quarterly earnings reports that has been performed to date. Our results are contrary to those of Reinganum and show that abnormal returns could have been earned almost any time during the 1970's. Our analysis also indicates that risk adjustments matter little in this type of work. Finally, we find that roughly 50% of the adjustment of stock returns to unexpected quarterly earnings occurs over a 90-day period after the earnings are announced.","['Richard J.

The nature of these restrictions support the hypothesis that bond convenants are structured to control the conflict of interest between stockholders and bondholders. Further, the empirical evidence suggests that these constraints are not binding — i.e., stockholders do not pay themselves as much dividends as they are allowed to.

Bond indenture provisions and the risk of corporate debt,"This paper examines the effect of alternative bond indenture provisions on the allocation of risk among the firm's claimants. The approach taken here differs from that of earlier studies in that risk allocation is examined while the firm's leverage (in market value terms) is held constant. In this context, four indenture provisions are examined: (1) the time to maturity, (2) the promised payment schedule, (3) financing restrictions and (4) priority rules. It is concluded that risk is transferred from stockholders to bondholders as the time to maturity and promised payment increase appropriately. Furthermore substitution of longer-term debt for an equal amount of shorter-term debt also increases the risk to bondholders while decreasing the risk to stockholders. The analysis shows that a coupon bond can be represented by a unique discount bond with the same risk and value. This permits the characterization of the effective maturity of a risky debt issue, a concept analogous to the stochastic duration of a default-free coupon bond. These results are shown to be independent of the means used to finance the debt issue. Finally, it is concluded that the relative risk associated with different bonds issued by the same firm cannot be determined by the structure of priority rules alone. It is also necessary to consider the timing of the promised payments compared to that of the other debt issues in the firm's capital structure.","['Thomas S.Y. Ho', 'Ronald F.

Discrete terms are added to the original Breeden-Litzenberger formula to reflect possible discontinuities of the call option price's derivative with respect to the exercise price.

Optimal dealer pricing under transactions and return uncertainty,"The paper examines the optimal behavior of a single dealer who is faced with a stochastic demand to trade (modeled by a continuous time Poisson jump process) and facing return risk on his stock and on the rest of his portfolio (modeled by diffusion processes). Using stochastic dynamic programming, we derive the optimal bid and ask prices that maximize the dealer's expected utility of terminal wealth as a function of the state in which he finds himself. The relationship of the bid and ask prices to inventory of the dealer, instantaneous variance of return, stochastic arrival of transactions and other variables is examined.","['Thomas Ho', 'Hans R.

Convertible calls and security returns,"The study examines the impact of convertible security calls on securityholder's wealth. On average common stock values fall by approximately two percent at the announcements of convertible debt calls, but common stockholder's wealth is unaffected by convertible preferred stock calls.

"Risky debt, jump processes, and safety covenants",The usual assumptions in the continuous-time contingent claims pricing of risky debt are (1) the firm is in default only when the value of its remaining assets falls short of the currently due promised payment and (2) the firm value follows continuous diffusion-process dynamics. It is the joint relaxation of these two simplifying assumptions that motivate this paper in its study of the valuation of risky debt and safety covenants when the firm value follows (possibly) discontinuous sample paths.

Information aggregation in a noisy rational expectations economy,"This paper analyzes a general equilibrium model of a competitive security market in which traders possess independent pieces of information about the return of a risky asset. Each trader conditions his estimate of the return both on his own private source of information and price, which in equilibrium serves as a ‘noisy’ aggregator of the total information observed by all traders.

Valuation of risky assets in arbitrage-free economies with transactions costs,"This paper analyzes the equilibrium valuation of risky assets in the case where transactions costs are present. The methodology involves applying ‘theorems of the alternative’ (Farkas' Lemma) as a consequence of arbitrage-free markets.

Option pricing in a lognormal securities market with discrete trading,"This paper derives a call option valuation equation assuming discrete trading in securities markets where the underlying asset and market returns are bivariate lognormally distributed and investors have increasing, concave utility functions exhibiting skewness preference. Since the valuation does not require the continouus time riskfree hedging of Black and Scholes, nor the discrete time riskfree hedging of Cox, Ross and Rubinstein, market effects are introduced into the option valuation relation. The new option valuation seems to correct for the systematic mispricing of well-in and well-out of the money options by the Black and Scholes option pricing formula.","['Wayne Y. Lee', 'Ramesh K.S.

The results are consistent with a market in which investors price securities such that expected arbitrage profits are precluded. The results are also consistent with the hypothesis that firms offer premia for their own shares mainly in order to signal positive information, and that the market uses the premium, the target fraction and the fraction of insider holdings as signals in order to price securities around the announcement date. The observation that repurchases via tender offer are followed by abnormal increases in earnings per share and that mainly small firms engage in repurchase tender offers, provides further support for the signalling hypothesis.",['Theo Vermaelen'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X81900118,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.03882149032905,9,2,Theo Vermaelen,1981,166.6895208464058
A continuous time equilibrium model of forward prices and futures prices in a multigood economy,"This paper is a theoretical investigation of equilibrium forward and futures prices. We construct a rational expectations model in continuous time of a multigood, identical consumer economy with constant stochastic returns to scale production. Using this model we find three main results. First, we find formulas for equilibrium forward, futures, discount bond, commodity bond and commodity option prices. Second, we show that a futures price is actually a forward price for the delivery of a random number of units of a good; the random number is the return earned from continuous reinvestment in instantaneously riskless bonds until maturity of the futures contract. Third, we find and interpret conditions under which normal backwardation or contango is found in forward or futures prices; these conditions reflect the usefulness of forward and futures contracts as consumption hedges.","['Scott F.

Misspecification of capital asset pricing,"This study documents empirical anomalies which suggest that either the simple one-period capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is misspecified or that capital markets are inefficient. In particular, portfolios based on firm size or earnings/price (E/P) ratios experience average returns systematically different from those predicted by the CAPM. Furthermore, the ‘abnormal’ returns persist for at least two years. This persistence reduces the likelihood that these results are being generated by a market inefficiency. Rather, the evidence seems to indicate that the equilibrium pricing model is misspecified. However, the data also reveals that an E/P effect does not emerge after returns are controlled for the firm size effect; the firm size effect largely subsumes the E/P effect. Thus, while the E/P anomaly and value anomaly exist when each variable is considered separately, the two anomalies seem to be related to the same set of missing factors, and these factors appear to be more closely associated with firm size than E/P ratios.",['Marc R.

This ‘size effect’ has been in existence for at least forty years and is evidence that the capital asset pricing model is misspecified. The size effect is not linear in the market value; the main effect occurs for very small firms while there is little difference in return between average sized and large firms.

Mutual fund insurance,"During the 1970's, mutual fund insurance was sold in the U.S. by the Harleysville and Prudential Insurance Companies. This paper examines the valuation and demand for this insurance. It illustrates that because of its design, for many plausible combinations of model parameters, a competitive premium need not exist for the Harleysville contract. A competitive premium will always exist for the Prudential policy, however the value is directly related to the age of the purchaser. Harleysville charged the same premium to all funds and therefore was subject to adverse selection. Evidence of this effect is provided by illustrating that the demand for the insurance was directly related to its competitive market value.","['Mary Ann Gatto', 'Robert Geske', 'Robert Litzenberger', 'Howard Sosin']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X80900045,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.122979774939017,8,3,Mary Ann Gatto,1980,166.60537671675087

Optimal capital structure under corporate and personal taxation,"In this paper, a model of corporate leverage choice is formulated in which corporate and differential personal taxes exist and supply side adjustments by firms enter into the determination of equilibrium relative prices of debt and equity. The presence of corporate tax shield substitutes for debt such as accounting depreciation, depletion allowances, and investment tax credits is shown to imply a market equilibrium in which each firm has a unique interior optimum leverage decision (with or without leverage-related costs). The optimal leverage model yields a number of interesting predictions regarding cross-sectional and time-series properties of firms' capital structures. Extant evidence bearing on these predictions is examined.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Ronald W.

The purpose of this study was to construct hedges 5 and 15 minutes after they were initially identified as having an ex post return in excess of $20 per hedge.

Corporate leverage and growth the game-theoretic issues,"The equilibrium value of a levered firm facing growth opportunities is shown to involve the valuation of a lottery over (cooperative) games rather than a lottery over specific monetary outcomes. In the absence of assumptions about negotiating risk, the value of the firm's claims is seen to be ambiguous even with zero transactions costs. This ambiguity is compounded if the core of the game is empty. This paper rationalizes specific financial instruments and institutions as means for attenuating negotiation costs and core existence problems. Furthermore, the valuation of these instruments requires determining the certainty-equivalent of a lottery over games.","['Varouj A. Aivazian', 'Jeffrey L.

On estimating the expected return on the market,"The expected market return is a number frequently required for the solution of many investment and corporate finance problems, but by comparison with other financial variables, there has been little research on estimating this expected return. Current practice for estimating the expected market return adds the historical average realized excess market returns to the current observed interest rate. While this model explicitly reflects the dependence of the market return on the interest rate, it fails to account for the effect of changes in the level of market risk. Three models of equilibrium expected market returns which reflect this dependence are analyzed in this paper. Estimation procedures which incorporate the prior restriction that equilibrium expected excess returns on the market must be positive are derived and applied to return data for the period 1926–1978. The principal conclusions from this exploratory investigation are: (1) in estimating models of the expected market return, the non-negativity restriction of the expected excess return should be explicity included as part of the specification: (2) estimators which use realized returns should be adjusted for heteroscedasticity.",['Robert C.

During most of the period studied, from 1953 through 1977, the daily returns to the Standard and Poor's composite portfolio are inconsistent with both models.

Subsequently, there is a positive reaction to the approval of completed proposals and a negative reaction to cancelled proposals. Where proposals are vetoed by incumbent target management, there is a negative market reaction to the veto, but this does not eliminate the earlier positive reaction to the first announcement.

Dealership market,"This study considers the problem of a price-setting monopolistic market-maker in a dealership market where the stochastic demand and supply are depicted by price-dependent Poisson processes [following Garman (1976)]. The crux of the analysis is the dependence of the bid-ask prices on the market-maker's stock inventory position. We derive the optimal policy and its characteristics and compare it to Garman's. The results are shown to be consistent with some conjectures and observed phenomena, like the existence of a ‘preferred’ inventory position and the downward monotonicity of the bid-ask prices. For linear demand and supply functions we derive the behavior of the bid-ask spread and show that the transaction-to-transaction price behavior is intertemporally dependent. However, we prove that it is impossible to make a profit on this price dependence by trading against the market-maker. Thus, in this situation, serially dependent price-changes are consistent with the market efficiency hypothesis.","['Yakov Amihud', 'Haim Mendelson']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X80900203,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.122979774939017,8,1,Yakov Amihud,1980,166.60537671675087

This non-stationarity, which is admissible in the Sharpe-Lintner model, has two implications: First, it may bias econometric methods which fail to explicitly take into account the non-stationarity.

"Information dissemination, market efficiency and the frequency of transactions","Casual observers of the New York Stock Exchange are often dumbfounded by the frenetic behavior of its participants. If asked how such chaos generates accurate prices many academicians would reply that the ability to transact frequently is a virtue since it promotes prompt information dissemination and therefore market efficiency. However, in contrast to the NYSE where, during trading hours, trades may be consumated almost continuously, the Paris Stock Exchange trades each security only a handful of times a day. This continental contrast in market structure led us to reexamine the role of speed in markets. We have discovered that if sufficient uncertainty surrounds the dissemination of information, frequent transacting may be deleterious to market efficiency. In fact, in our paradigm we are able to show that our measure of market efficiency may be maximized when there is a unique, non-zero time interval between consecutive trades. The measure of efficiency used throughout the paper is minus the mean squared error. This measure was chosen to focus upon the information content of prices at times when they are posted (i.e., at times of tâtonnements). For this purpose we ignore costs of illiquidity and costs associated with obsolete information that would occur between tâtonnements. In this restricted sphere, maximazation of our efficiency measure is consistent with maximizing Social Pareto Optimality.","['M. Barry Goldman', 'Howard B.

Asymmetric information and portfolio performance measurement,"This note argues that though Dave Mayers and Edward Rice were able to show that the CAPM could be used to detect superior investors in a world of asymmetric information, their demonstration does not resurrect the CAPM as a practical tool for performance measurement. To employ the Mayers-Rice model, an investment advisor would first have to determine that the CAPM holds for uninformed investors. As a means of avoiding the problem of testing the CAPM, a performance measure based only on returns is outlined. The measure is robust in that it would correctly designate superior investors in context of the CAPM, the arbitrage pricing model and many other equilibrium models of security pricing.",['Bradford Cornell'],[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X79900059,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.2071380595489845,7,4,Bradford Cornell,1979,166.52123258709597

An intertemporal asset pricing model with stochastic consumption and investment opportunities,"This paper derives a single-beta asset pricing model in a multi-good, continuous-time model with uncertain consumption-goods prices and uncertain investment opportunities. When no riskless asset exists, a zero-beta pricing model is derived. Asset betas are measured relative to changes in the aggregate real consumption rate, rather than relative to the market. In a single-good model, an individual's asset portfolio results in an optimal consumption rate that has the maximum possible correlation with changes in aggregate consumption. If the capital markets are unconstrained Pareto-optimal, then changes in all individuals' optimal consumption rates are shown to be perfectly correlated.",['Douglas T.

The effect of personal taxes and dividends on capital asset prices,"This paper derives an after tax version of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The model accounts for a progressive tax scheme and for wealth and income related constraints on borrowing. The equilibrium relationship indicates that before-tax expected rates of return are linearly related to systematic risk and to dividend yield. The sample estimates of the variances of observed betas are used to arrive at maximum likelihood estimators of the coefficients. The results indicate that, unlike prior studies, there is a strong positive relationship between dividend yield and expected return for NYSE stocks. Evidence is also presented for a clientele effect.","['Robert H.

Financial leverage clienteles,"This paper examines the hypothesis that investors will sort themselves out into tax-induced ‘financial leverage clienteless’ in which the common stocks of highly levered firms will be held by individuals with low personal tax rates, while the shares of firms with little or no leverage will be held by individuals with high personal tax rates. Although the idea of financial leverage clienteless has appeared in the literature before, the immediate motivation for this investigation is a recent paper by Merton Miller. In that paper he argues that under the current U.S. tax structure, personal taxes will offset corporate taxes such that in equilibrium the value of any individual firm will be independent of its use of debt financing. We extend his analysis to show specifically the way in which financial leverage clienteles would come about in his assumed tax environment. We then conduct some direct empirical tests of the leverage clientele hypothesis. These tests can also be viewed as indirect tests of Miller's new proposition on the irrelevance of capital structures. The results of the tests are mixed: The relationship between corporate leverage policies and investors' tax rates is statistically significant, but its magnitude is less than would be predicted by the theory.","['E.

Its development requires only elementary mathematics, yet it contains as a special limiting case the celebrated Black-Scholes model, which has previously been derived only by much more difficult methods.

The valuation of compound options,"This paper presents a theory for pricing options on options, or compound options. The method can be generalized to value many corporate liabilities. The compound call option formula derived herein considers a call option on stock which is itself an option on the assets of the firm. This perspective incorporates leverage effects into option pricing and consequently the variance of the rate of return on the stock is not constant as Black-Scholes assumed, but is instead a function of the level of the stock price. The Black-Scholes formula is shown to be a special case of the compound option formula.

Liquidity preference under uncertainty: A model of dynamic investment in illiquid opportunities,"Whereas frictionless exchange markets provide a high degree of liquidity for financial assets, investments in real assets and productive capacity may be very costly to modify, and thus effectively irreversible in the short-run. This paper addresses the problem of an investor (individual or enterprise) who must allocate a limited resource to productive investments over time. Investment opportunities arrive in a random sequence and are irreversible in the short-run: thus investment decisions are made under uncertainty as to future opportunities (which may have to be foregone). The analysis demonstrates that a rational investor will demand a higher return on long-lasting opportunities than on those which are instantaneously reversible. The liquidity premium increases with the average duration of the non-liquid investments.","['Carliss Y. Baldwin', 'Richard F.

However, dividend and financing policy restrictions are written to give stockholders incentives to follow a firm-value-maximizing production/investment policy.

The formula relates the price of bonds to the real rate of interest, the anticipated rate of inflation and the equilibrium prices of interest rate and inflation risks.

The tests are directed toward the question whether arbitrage profits could actually have been made on the Exchange by exploiting the violations of the dominance condition.

The market valuation of cash dividends,"Since early 1956 Citizens Utilities Company has had two classes of common stock which are virtually identical in all respects except dividend payout. One class pays only stock dividends, the other class pays only cash dividends, and the corporate charter requires that the dividends per share on the two classes be of equivalent value. Under an I.R.S. ruling granted to Citizens Utilities in 1955 and a ‘grandfather clause’ in the 1969 Tax Reform Act, the stock dividends are not taxable as ordinary income. (No other publicly held firm has such a ruling and, in general, the 1969 Act made stock dividends of this type taxable.) Given these circumstances, the price-dividend history of the Citizens Utilities shares provides a view of the effects of alternative payout policies which, to an exceptional degree, is free of confounding factors. Close examination of this history implies that, if anything, claims to cash dividends have commanded a slight premium in the market over claims to equal amounts (before taxes) of capital gains.",['John B.

"Split information, stock returns and market efficiency-I","This is the first part of a study about common stock returns around split events (part I) and dividend change events (part II) as revealed in the 1947–1967 experience of the New York Stock Exchange. Competing estimates of abnormal returns (residuals) are obtained and compared. Trading rules, involving fixed and variable monthly investments, are tested for profitability. Trading triggered by split proposals, dividend increases and, in particular, dividend decreases yields significant residuals and would thus point to market inefficiencies. Some drifting in the samples' average risk and residual behavior is explained in terms of risk measurement and two-factor market model characteristics. Residuals hardly change when risk adjustment is based on variance of returns in lieu of beta. The question is raised that the residual approach may at times prove unduly refined. Yet a multi-method approach to risk-return studies seems advisable because the odd behavior found one way can often be fruitfully explained or confirmed through comparisons with results obtained another way. In part I below outstanding features are: (1) the stocks' average excess returns in the three months following split proposals differ from zero but the anomaly hinges on the results for a rather short time sub-period; (2) numerous pitfalls in measuring and interpreting stocks' residuals are brought into light.

Efficient portfolio choice with differential taxation of dividends and capital gains,"A simple, necessary and sufficient condition is derived under which portfolios that are mean-variance efficient on a before-tax basis are also efficient on an after-tax basis and vice-versa. Under this condition and the hypothesis that investors demand after-tax efficient portfolios, the ‘no-tax’ form of the Capital Asset Pricing Model provides an accurate description of equilibrium asset returns even though investors in the economy may be subject to a wide variety of tax rates on dividends and capital gains. Evidence reported by Black and Scholes (1974), however, makes the condition for equivalence of before and after-tax efficiency empirically implausible. The paper thus concludes with a characterization of some essential differences between before and after-tax efficient portfolios and of the after-tax efficiency losses associated with before-tax efficient portfolios.

"Trading rules, large blocks and the speed of price adjustment",In this paper large block stock transactions are examined in the context of a trading rule devised by Grier and Albin. The study makes use of the actual intra-day history of stock transactions. Considerable effort is taken to correctly incorporate the effects of transaction costs on trading rule profits and evidence is presented on the sensitivity of such profits to variations in these costs. The use of intra-day prices yields results consistent with the weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis and provides important evidence on the speed of price adjustment.,"['Larry Y.

Capital market equilibrium in a mean-lower partial moment framework,"In this paper, we develop a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using a mean-lower partial moment framework. We explicitly derive formulae for the equilibrium values of risky assets that hold for arbitrary probability distributions. We show that when the probability distributions and portfolio returns are either normal, stable (with the same characteristic exponent between 1 and 2 and the same skewness parameter, not necessarily zero), or Student-t distributions, our CAPM reduces to the traditional mean-scale CAPM's. Consequently, since the traditional equilibrium models are special cases of our model, the mean-lower partial moment framework is guaranteed to do at least as well in explaining market data. As an application of our theory, we derive an acceptance criterion for capital investment projects and note that corporate finance theory results developed, for example, in the well-known mean- variance framework carry over to the mean-lower partial moment framework.","['Vijay S.

Determinants of corporate borrowing,"Many corporate assets, particularly growth opportunities, can be viewed as call options. The value of such ‘real options’ depends on discretionary future investment by the firm. Issuing risky debt reduces the present market value of a firm holding real options by inducing a suboptimal investment strategy or by forcing the firm and its creditors to bear the costs of avoiding the suboptimal strategy. The paper predicts that corporate borrowing is inversely related to the proportion of market value accounted for by real options. It also rationalizes other aspects of corporate borrowing behavior, for example the practice of matching maturities of assets and debt liabilities.",['Stewart C.

Long-term dependence in common stock returns,"The efficient market, martingale model of security price movements requires that the arrival of new information be promptly arbitraged away. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an arbitraged price is that statistical dependence among prices must decrease very rapidly. If persistent statistical dependence is present, the arbitraged price changes do not follow a martingale and should have an infinite variance. Using a technique for detecting long-term dependence, called R/S analysis, 200 daily stock return series are studied; many series are characterized by long-term dependence. Thus, in the presence of long-term dependence, the martingale model does not hold. Also, the distribution of security returns is non-normal stable Paretian as opposed to Gaussian.","['Myron T.

An equilibrium characterization of the term structure,"The paper derives a general form of the term structure of interest rates. The following assumptions are made: (A.1) The instantaneous (spot) interest rate follows a diffusion process; (A.2) the price of a discount bond depends only on the spot rate over its term; and (A.3) the market is efficient. Under these assumptions, it is shown by means of an arbitrage argument that the expected rate of return on any bond in excess of the spot rate is proportional to its standard deviation. This property is then used to derive a partial differential equation for bond prices. The solution to that equation is given in the form of a stochastic integral representation. An interpretation of the bond pricing formula is provided.

Although it is to be expected a priori that relatively sophisticated strategies will perform at least as well as the more naive strategies, implementation costs will clearly differ across strategies and across investor-specific parameters such as total portfolio value. Thus estimation of the various strategies' performance gross of these costs is a necessary consideration in rational strategy selection by any given investor.","['Ted Bloomfield', 'Richard Leftwich', 'John B.

This study includes estimation of the loan companies' cost function, (accounting) profit rates and output and a survey of the individuals directly affected by the demise of the companies.

For the case of limited, but sufficient (sample plus prior) information, we show that for a general family of conjugate priors, the optimal portfolio choice is obtained by the use of a mean-variance analysis that differs from traditional mean-variance analysis due to estimation risk. We also consider two illustrative cases of insufficient sample information and minimal prior information and show that in these cases it is asymptotically optimal for an investor to limit diversification to a subset of the securities.

Portfolio choice and equilibrium in capital markets with safety-first investors,"This paper develops optimal portfolio choice and market equilibrium when investors behave according to a generalized lexicographic safety-first rule. We show that the mutual fund separation property holds for the optimal portfolio choice of a risk-averse safety-first investor. We also derive an explicit valuation formula for the equilibrium value of assets. The valuation formula reduces to the well-known two-parameter capital asset pricing model (CAPM) when investors approximate the tail of the portfolio distribution using Tchebychev's inequality or when the assets have normal or stable Paretian distributions. This shows the robustness of the CAPM to safety-first investors under traditional distributional assumptions. In addition, we indicate how additional information about the portfolio distribution can be incorporated to the safety-first valuation formula to obtain alternative empirically testable models.","['Enrique R.

The discount rates are known and non-stochastic, but the rates for the different periods preceding the realization of a cash flow need not to be the same, and the rates relevant for a given period can differ across cash flows.

A Sharpe-Lintner type international capital asset pricing model is derived as a special case. Proportional ad valorem commodity taxes and transportation costs are incorporated in the valuation model, interest rate parity and purchasing power parity are reinterpreted under uncertainty, and international differences in borrowing and lending are shown to reflect, in part, differences in risk aversion across countries.","['Frederick L.A.

Their market activities are depicted as the stochastic generation of market orders according to a Poisson process. The objective is to effectively describe the ‘temporal microstructure’, or moment-to-moment trading activities in asset markets. Two basic models, ‘dealership’ vs. ‘auction’ markets (and their variants) are put forth. Implications are drawn from each model. The implications include several testable hypotheses regarding the aggregate behavior of markets and market-makers as well as some qualitative insight into the transaction-to-transaction nature of realistic exchange processes.",['Mark B.

The pricing of commodity contracts,"The contract price on a forward contract stays fixed for the life of the contract, while a futures contract is rewritten every day. The value of a futures contract is zero at the start of each day. The expected change in the futures price satisfies a formula like the capital asset pricing model. If changes in the futures price are independent of the return on the market, the futures price is the expected spot price. The futures market is not unique in its ability to shift risk, since corporations can do that too. The futures market is unique in the guidance it provides for producers, distributors, and users of commodities. Using assumptions like those used in deriving the original option formula, we find formulas for the values of forward contracts and commodity options in terms of the futures price and other variables.",['Fischer Black'],[],[],January–March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X76900246,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.459612913378886,3,1,Fischer Black,1976,166.26880019813117
Option pricing when underlying stock returns are discontinuous,"The validity of the classic Black-Scholes option pricing formula depends on the capability of investors to follow a dynamic portfolio strategy in the stock that replicates the payoff structure to the option. The critical assumption required for such a strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock return dynamics can be described by a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In this paper, an option pricing formula is derived for the more-general case when the underlying stock returns are generated by a mixture of both continuous and jump processes. The derived formula has most of the attractive features of the original Black-Scholes formula in that it does not depend on investor preferences or knowledge of the expected return on the underlying stock. Moreover, the same analysis applied to the options can be extended to the pricing of corporate liabilities.",['Robert C.

The effect of estimation risk on optimal portfolio choice,"This paper determines the effect of estimation risk on optimal portfolio choice under uncertainty. In most realistic problems, the parameters of return distributions are unknown and are estimated using available economic data. Traditional analysis neglects estimation risk by treating the estimated parameters as if they were the true parameters to determine the optimal choice under uncertainty. We show that for normally distributed returns and ‘non-informative’ or ‘invariant’ priors, the admissible set of portfolios taking the estimation uncertainty into account is identical to that given by traditional analysis. However, as a result of estimation risk, the optimal portfolio choice differs from that obtained by traditional analysis. For other plausible priors, the admissible set, and consequently the optimal choice, is shown to differ from that in traditional analysis.","['Roger W. Klein', 'Vijay S.

Additionally, piecewise linear taxes, margin requirements, transactions costs, etc., are all easily incorporated into the PL-option framework.

By constructing a simplified model for these funds under the ‘perfect hedge’ conditions of Black and Scholes, it is demonstrated that the asset value of the fund will always exceed the market value and that it is not inconsistent with market equilibrium or efficiency for the capital shares to sell at a discount. The simple model predicts price fluctuations in the seven dual funds studied quite well; however, there is a persistent downward bias in the predicted price level.

Corporate pension funding policy,"What policy should a corporation adopt concerning the funding of a defined-benefit pension plan and the investment of the assets held in trust for the plan? Until recently, pension plans did not have to be insured, and some risk could be borne by intended beneficiaries. Federal legislation has now mandated such coverage. This paper analyzes corporate policy under three conditions which correspond, roughly, to the earlier situation (‘uninsure’ loans), the current situation (‘partially insured’ loans), and the situation required by law to be implemented in the future (‘completely insured’ plans). We show that if insurance premiums are set correctly, corporate policy in this area may not matter; otherwise the optimal policy may simply be that which maximizes the difference between the value of the insurance and its cost.",['William F.

Forward rates as predictors of future spot rates,"When adjusted for variation through time in expected premiums, the forward rates of interest that are implicit in Treasury Bill prices contain assessments of expected future spot rates of interest that are about as good as those that can be obtained from the information in past spot rates. Moreover, in setting bill prices and forward rates, the market reacts appropriately to the negative autocorrelation in monthly changes in the spot rate and to changes through time in the degree of this autocorrelation.

"Cash demand, liquidation costs and capital market equilibrium under uncertainty","In this paper, the portfolio and the liquidity planning problems are unified and analyzed in one model. Stochastic cash demands have a significant impact on both the composition of an individual's optimal portfolio and the pricing of capital assets in market equilibrium. The derived capital asset pricing model with cash demands and liquidation costs shows that both the market price of risk and the systematic risk of an asset are affected by the aggregate cash demands and liquidity risk. The modified model does not require that all investors hold an identical risky portfolio as implied by the Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin model. Furthermore, it provides a possible explanation for the noted discrepancies between the empirical evidence and the prediction of the traditional capital asset pricing model.","['Andrew H.

Optimal rules for ordering uncertain prospects,"In this paper, we obtain the optimal selection rule for ordering uncertain prospects for all individuals with decreasing absolute risk averse utility functions. The optimal selection rule minimizes the admissible set of alternatives by discarding, from among a given set of alternatives, those that are inferior (for each utility function in the restricted class) to a member of the given set. We show that the Third Order Stochastic Dominance (TSD) rule is the optimal rule when comparing uncertain prospects with equal means. We also show that in the general case of unequal means, no known selection rule uses both necessary and sufficient conditions for dominance, and the TSD rule may be used to obtain a reasonable approximation to the smallest admissible set. The TSD rule is complex and we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the TSD admissible set. For certain restrictive classes of the probability distributions (of returns on uncertain prospects) which cover most commonly used distributions in finance and economics, we obtain the optimal rule and show that it reduces to a simple form. We also study the relationship of the optimal selection rule to others previously advocated in the literature, including the more popular mean-variance rule as well as the semi-variance rule.",['Vijay S.

Motivating managers to make investment decisions,"Owners of capital frequently lack knowledge about investment opportunities. One alternative is to turn to a manager for assistance. The owner's problem of contracting for the services of a manager is treated as a problem in buying information. The surprising result is that it is sometimes possible to trade information even when the owner is unable to form his own assessment of the information's value. Under some conditions it is possible to write a managerial compensation contract which will induce the manager to act in the best interests of the owner.

The notion that an expansion in the opportunity set of individual investors causes improvements in their welfare is analyzed to take account of the effects on their wealth. With the supplies of investments held constant, the effects of changes in the macroparameters of the risk-return pricing relationship, caused by the merger of capital markets, on the wealth of individuals in the new equilibrium, are determined. Using three specific utility functions – quadratic, exponential and logarithmic – it is shown that international capital market integration is Pareto-optimal, i.e., the welfare of individuals in the economies considered never declines, and will generally improve. The effect of expansion of the opportunity set, due to the integration of capital markets, nullifies the effect of a possible negative change in wealth.",['Marti G.

A negative report on the ‘near optimality’ of the max-expected-log policy as applied to bounded utilities for long lived programs,"Much controversy surrounds the use of the portfolio investment rules induced by maximizing the expected logarithm of terminal wealth (henceforth referred to as the MEL policy). It has been thought that the MEL policy is a good approximation to the optimal investment program when the utility of terminal wealth function is bounded and when the time horizon is long. However, I exhibit a class of bounded utility of terminal wealth functions for which the MEL policy is a very poor approximation to the optimal program. Hence, the wholesale use of the MEL policy as an approximation to the optimal program is unwarranted.",['M.Barry Goldman'],[],[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X74900117,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.627929482598821,1,1,M.Barry Goldman,1974,166.10051193882134
Determinants of bid-asked spreads in the over-the-counter market,"Security market regulators, among others, are concerned to know whether or not dealers are natural monopolists. Based on a randomly drawn sample of 314 over-the-counter stocks, the results of this study suggest that while there are economies of scale, they are not on the dealer level. In addition, both systematic and unsystematic risk were tested for association with the transaction costs in this market. The evidence suggests unsystematic risk is related to spread.","['George J.

Fallacy of the log-normal approximation to optimal portfolio decision-making over many periods,"The fallacy that a many-period expected-utility maximizer should maximize (a) the expected logarithm of portfolio outcomes or (b) the expected average compound return of his portfolio is now understood to rest upon a fallacious use of the Law of Large Numbers. This paper exposes a more subtle fallacy based upon a fallacious use of the Central-Limit Theorem. While the properly normalized product of independent random variables does asymptotically approach a log-normal distribution under proper assumptions, it involves a fallacious manipulation of double limits to infer from this that a maximizer of expected utility after many periods will get a useful approximation to his optimal policy by calculating an efficiency frontier based upon (a) the expected log of wealth outcomes and its variance or (b) the expected average compound return and its variance. Expected utilities calculated from the surrogate log-normal function differ systematically from the correct expected utilities calculated from the true probability distribution. A new concept of ‘initial wealth equivalent’ provides a transitive ordering of portfolios that illuminates commonly held confusions. A non-fallacious application of the log-normal limit and its associated mean-variance efficiency frontier is established for a limit where any fixed horizon period is subdivided into ever more independent sub-intervals. Strong mutual-fund Separation Theorems are then shown to be asymptotically valid.","['Robert C. Merton', 'Paul A.

A note on diversification and the reduction of dispersion,The purpose of this paper is to note that the question of optimal diversification cannot be answered simply by determining the average variability of equally allocated investment. Empirical results are presented which show that it is possible to obtain the same level of average variation with far greater average portfolio returns and fewer securities in the portfolio by using an alternative allocation scheme.,"['K.H.

Transactions costs and the relationship between put and call prices,"The relationship between prices of puts and calls on securities that is suggested by the theory of efficient markets is developed and empirically tested in this paper. We find that the basic model is not supported unless rather large transactions costs are included. Moreover, the transactions costs that must be assumed to make the model consistent with the data are so large as to raise troublesome questions as to whether there were unexploited profit opportunities in the options market at least during the 1967–1969 period. We also find that similar deviations from the efficient market hypothesis have shown up in related work by other researchers but that their explanations of these results appear to be incorrect on theoretical grounds or too sanguine.","['J.P.

Convergence to isoelastic utility and policy in multiperiod portfolio choice,"This paper considers the problem of the investor who has numerous opportunities for revising his portfolio and whose choices are governed by a utility function defined on ‘terminal’ wealth, U0(x0). Attention is focussed on the behavior of the induced utility functions of intermediate wealth with n periods to go, Un(xn), and the associated investment policies. Conditions under which the functions Un(xn) will tend to isoelasticity have previously been given by Mossin and by Leland. In this paper, the conditions for convergence are weakened further, to the point where they appear sufficiently broad to encompass perhaps most utility functions of practical interest.",['Nils H.

Portfolio turnpike theorems for constant policies,"This paper develops general overtaking techniques for studying the asymptotic properties of portfolio policies optimal with respect to a terminal utility valuation. For a restricted class of utility functions the sequence of optimal constant (non-revised) portfolio policies formed as the horizon recedes into the future is shown to converge. Furthermore, for utility functions unbounded above and below, this turnpike policy need not be the policy associated with the minimal constant relative risk aversion function that bounds the valuation function from above. Finally, an analogy between the portfolio turnpike problem and the turnpike problem of growth theory is studied.",['Stephen A.

Money and stock prices,"This paper examines stock market efficiency with respect to money supply data by testing (1) regression models of stock returns on monetary variables and (2) trading rules based on money supply data. The evidence indicates no meaningful lag in the effect of monetary policy on the stock market and that no profitable security trading rules using past values of the money supply exist. Therefore this evidence is consistent with the efficient market model. Current security returns incorporate all information contained in past money supply data and, in addition, appear to anticipate future changes in the money supply. A number of previous studies have concluded that lags exist and can be used in profitable trading rules. Analysis of these studies demonstrates that for a variety of reasons the evidence in these past studies does not sustain such conclusions.",['Michael S.

International capital market equilibrium with investment barriers,"This paper outlines models of capital market equilibrium when there are explicit barriers to international investment in the form of a tax on holdings of assets in one country by residents of another country. There is a corresponding subsidy on short positions in foreign assets. Asset prices deviate from the predictions of the world capital asset pricing model. Investors do not hold a mixture of national market portfolios, but the mix of risky assets is the same for every investor in a country. Optimal portfolios tend to be heavy in domestic assets, and light in foreign assets. Tax free investors, however, tend to hold assets anywhere in the world that are taxed heavily. Estimates of the magnitude of the average tax (or the magnitude of effective barriers to international investment) can be made by comparing the average return on the minimum variance zero β portfolio, z, with the average across countries and time of the short-term interest rate. When barriers are ineffective, the expected return on portfolio z will be the average short-term interest rate, and the world capital asset pricing model will hold.",['Fischer Black'],[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X74900130,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.627929482598821,1,4,Fischer Black,1974,166.10051193882134
"Portfolio theory, job choice and the equilibrium structure of expected wages","This paper presents some of the implications of modern portfolio theory for the equilibrium structure of wages under conditions of uncertainty. The primary model presented is a model of wage uncertainty and hence the equilibrium structure is derived in terms of expected wages. The equilibrium structure with the assumption of a perfect labor market (e.g., labor units are infinitely divisible and costlessly mobile) and a perfect capital market is shown to have a very simple linear form. The model assumes homogeneous labor units as well as the usual single-period capital asset pricing model assumptions.",['David Mayers'],[],[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X74900075,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.627929482598821,1,1,David Mayers,1974,166.10051193882134
The effects of dividend yield and dividend policy on common stock prices and returns,"This paper suggests that it is not possible to demonstrate, using the best available empirical methods, that the expected returns on high yield common stocks differ from the expected returns on low yield common stocks either before or after taxes. A taxable investor who concentrates his portfolio in low yield securities cannot tell from the data whether he is increasing or decreasing his expected after-tax return by so doing. A tax exempt investor who concentrates his portfolio in high yield securities cannot tell from the data whether he is increasing or decreasing his expected return. We argue that the best method for testing the effects of dividend policy on stock prices is to test the effects of dividend yield on stock returns. Thus the fact that we cannot tell, using the best available methods, what effects dividend yield has on stock returns implies that we cannot tell what effect, if any, a change in dividend policy will have on a corporation's stock price.","['Fischer Black', 'Myron Scholes']",[],[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X74900063,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.627929482598821,1,1,Fischer Black,1974,166.10051193882134
Risk and return: The case of merging firms,"This study examines the market for acquisitions and the impact of mergers on the returns to the stockholders of the constituent firms. While employing the two-factor market model as recently developed and applied by Black-Jensen-Scholes and Fama-MacBeth, this study also considers changes in risk in analyzing the impact of mergers on stock prices. The results of the study are consistent with the hypothesis that the market for acquisitions is perfectly competitive and with the hypothesis that information regarding mergers is efficiently incorporated in the stock prices. Stockholders of acquiring firms seem to earn normal returns from mergers as from other investment-production activities with commensurate risk levels. Stockholders of acquired firms earn abnormal returns of approximately 14%, on the average, in the seven months preceding the merger.",['Gershon Mandelker'],[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X74900129,Journal of Financial Economics,-2.627929482598821,1,4,Gershon Mandelker,1974,166.10051193882134
