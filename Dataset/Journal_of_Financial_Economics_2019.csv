Are lemons sold first? Dynamic signaling in the mortgage market,"A central result in the theory of adverse selection in asset markets is that informed sellers can signal quality and obtain higher prices by delaying trade. This paper provides some of the first evidence of a signaling mechanism through trade delays using the residential mortgage market as a laboratory. We find a strong relationship between mortgage performance and time to sale for privately securitized mortgages. Additionally, deals made up of more seasoned mortgages are sold at lower yields. These effects are strongest in the “Alt-A” segment of the market, where mortgages are often sold with incomplete hard information, and in cases where the originator and the issuer of mortgage-backed securities are not affiliated.","['Manuel Adelino', 'Kristopher Gerardi', 'Barney Hartman-Glaser']","['Mortgage markets', 'Asymmetric information', 'Signaling']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302575,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,1
Should Long-Term Investors Time Volatility?,"A long-term investor who ignores variation in volatility gives up the equivalent of 2.4% of wealth per year. This result holds for a wide range of parameters that are consistent with US stock market data, and it is robust to estimation uncertainty. We propose and test a new channel, the volatility composition channel, for how investment horizon interacts with volatility timing. Investors respond substantially less to volatility variation if the amount of mean reversion in returns disproportionally increases with volatility and also if mean reversion happens quickly. We find that these conditions are unlikely to hold in the data.","['Alan Moreira', 'Tyler Muir']","['Volatility', 'Portfolio choice', 'Market timing', 'Mean reversion']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302745,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,3
Average skewness matters,"Average skewness, which is the average of monthly skewness values across firms, performs well at predicting future market returns. This prediction still holds after controlling for the size or liquidity of the firms or for current business cycle conditions. Also, average skewness compares favorably with other economic and financial predictors of subsequent market returns. The asset allocation exercise based on predictive regressions also shows that average skewness generates superior performance.","['Eric Jondeau', 'Qunzi Zhang', 'Xiaoneng Zhu']","['Return predictability', 'Average skewness', 'Idiosyncratic skewness']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300571,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,1
The leverage effect and the basket-index put spread,"Benchmark models that exogenously specify equity dynamics cannot explain the large spread in prices between put options written on individual banks and options written on the bank index during the financial crisis. However, theory requires that asset dynamics be specified exogenously and that endogenously determined equity dynamics exhibit a “leverage effect” that increases put prices by fattening the left tail of the distribution. The leverage effect is larger for puts on individual stocks than for puts on the index, thus increasing the basket-index spread. Time-series and cross-sectional variation in the leverage effect explains option prices well.","['Jennie Bai', 'Robert S. Goldstein', 'Fan Yang']","['Leverage effect', 'Option price', 'Credit spread', 'Volatility']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302022,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,1
Policy externalities and banking integration,"Can policies directed at the banking sector in one jurisdiction spill over and affect real economic activity elsewhere? To investigate this question, I exploit changes in tax rates on bank profits across US states. Banks respond by reallocating small business lending to otherwise unaffected states. Moreover, counties in non-tax-changing states that have more exposure to treated banks experience greater changes in lending, which in turn impacts local employment. The findings demonstrate that policies aimed at the banking sector in one jurisdiction can impose externalities on other regions. Critically, financial linkages between regions serve as the transmission channel for these policy externalities.",['Michael Smolyansky'],"['Banks', 'Credit supply', 'Policy arbitrage', 'Small business lending', 'Taxation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1830309X,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,3
The use of credit default swaps by bond mutual funds: Liquidity provision and counterparty risk,"Corporate bond mutual funds increased their selling of credit protection in the credit default swaps (CDS) market during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. This trading activity was primarily in multi-name CDS, greater among larger and established funds, and directed toward counterparty dealers in financial distress. Funds that sold credit protection during the crisis experienced greater credit market risk and superior post-crisis performance, consistent with higher expected returns from liquidity provision. Funds using Lehman Brothers as a counterparty experienced abnormal outflows and returns of –2% immediately following Lehman's bankruptcy, suggesting that funds’ opportunistic trading in CDS exposed investors to counterparty risk.","['George O.

Corporate leverage and employees’ rights in bankruptcy,"Corporate leverage responds differently to employees’ rights in bankruptcy depending on whether it is driven by strategic concerns in wage bargaining or by credit constraints. Using novel data on employees’ rights in bankruptcy, we estimate their impact on leverage, exploiting time-series, cross-country, and firm-level variation in the data. For financially unconstrained firms, results accord with the strategic debt model: leverage increases more in response to rises in corporate property values or profitability if employees have strong seniority in liquidation and weak rights in restructuring. Instead, in financially constrained firms leverage responds less to these shocks if employees have stronger seniority.","['Andrew Ellul', 'Marco Pagano']","['Workers’ rights', 'Bankruptcy', 'Seniority', 'Leverage', 'Wage bargaining']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301163,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,3
Shareholder bargaining power and the emergence of empty creditors,"Credit default swaps (CDSs) can create empty creditors who potentially force borrowers into inefficient bankruptcy but also reduce shareholders’ incentives to default strategically. We show theoretically and empirically that the presence and the effects of empty creditors on firm outcomes depend on the distribution of bargaining power among claimholders. If creditors would face powerful shareholders in debt renegotiation, firms are more likely to face the empty creditor problem. The empirical evidence confirms that more CDS insurance is written on firms with strong shareholders and that CDSs increase the bankruptcy risk of these same firms. The ensuing effect on firm value is negative.","['Stefano Colonnello', 'Matthias Efing', 'Francesca Zucchi']","['Empty creditors', 'Credit default swaps', 'Bargaining power', 'Real effects of financial markets']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300868,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,2
How do valuations impact outcomes of asset sales with heterogeneous bidders?,"Differences among bidder type-specific outcomes of asset sales are theoretically related to differences in bidders’ valuations and participation. The lead application to quantify these relations is takeover auctions: bidders are classified into strategic and financial, and bids are available. I structurally estimate valuations from all bids. The positive difference in premiums between strategic and financial acquirers is driven by the difference in dispersions of valuations (e.g., strategic bidders’ synergies are more dispersed) and the set of auction participants. The difference in average valuations is relatively unimportant. My approach can help explain outcomes of asset sales, even in settings with limited bidder data.",['Alexander S. Gorbenko'],"['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Takeover auctions', 'Strategic bidders', 'Financial bidders', 'Takeover premiums']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302083,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,1
Should retail investors’ leverage be limited?,"Does the provision of leverage to retail traders improve market quality or facilitate socially inefficient speculation that enriches financial intermediaries? We evaluate the effects of 2010 regulations that cap leverage in the U.S. retail foreign exchange market. Using three unique data sets and a difference-in-differences approach, we document that the leverage-constraint reduces trading volume by 23%, alleviates high-leverage traders’ losses by 40%, and reduces brokerages’ operating capital by 25%. Yet, the policy does not affect the relative bid-ask prices charged by the brokerages. These results suggest the policy improves belief-neutral social welfare without reducing market liquidity.","['Rawley Heimer', 'Alp Simsek']","['Leverage restriction policy', 'Foreign exchange market', 'Retail trading', 'Speculation', 'Consumer financial protection']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303076,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,3
Growing up without finance,"Early life exposure to local financial institutions increases household financial inclusion and leads to long-term improvements in consumer credit outcomes. We identify the effect of local financial markets using Congressional legislation that led to unintended differences in financial market development across Native American reservations. Individuals from financially underdeveloped reservations enter consumer credit markets later, and upon reaching adulthood, have ten point lower credit scores and four percentage point more delinquent accounts. These effects are long-lived and depreciate slowly after individuals move to more developed areas. Formative exposures to local banking improve consumer credit behavior by increasing financial literacy and financial trust.","['James R. Brown', 'J. Anthony Cookson', 'Rawley Z.

Government debt and the returns to innovation,"Elevated levels of government debt raise concerns about their effects on long-term growth prospects. Using the cross-section of US stock returns, we show that (i) high-R&D firms are more exposed to government debt and pay higher expected returns than low-R&D firms, and (ii) higher levels of the debt-to-GDP ratio predict higher risk premiums for high-R&D firms. Furthermore, rises in the cost of capital for innovation-intensive firms predict declines in subsequent productivity and economic growth. We propose a production-based asset pricing model with endogenous innovation and fiscal policy shocks that can rationalize key aspects of the empirical evidence. Our study highlights a novel and distinct risk channel shaping the link between government debt and future growth.","['M.M. Croce', 'Thien T. Nguyen', 'S. Raymond', 'L.

The CAPM strikes back? An equilibrium model with disasters,"Embedding disasters into a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms induces strong nonlinearity in the pricing kernel, helping explain the empirical failure of the (consumption) CAPM. Our single-factor model reproduces the failure of the CAPM in explaining the value premium in finite samples without disasters and its relative success in samples with disasters. Due to beta measurement errors, the estimated beta-return relation is flat, consistent with the beta “anomaly,” even though the true beta-return relation is strongly positive. Finally, the consumption CAPM fails in simulations, even though a nonlinear model with the true pricing kernel holds exactly by construction.","['Hang Bai', 'Kewei Hou', 'Howard Kung', 'Erica X.N.

Technological links and predictable returns,"Employing a classic measure of technological closeness between firms, we show that the returns of technology-linked firms have strong predictive power for focal firm returns. A long-short strategy based on this effect yields monthly alpha of 117 basis points. This effect is distinct from industry momentum and is not easily attributable to risk-based explanations. It is more pronounced for focal firms that: (a) have a more intense and specific technology focus, (b) receive lower investor attention, and (c) are more difficult to arbitrage. Our results are broadly consistent with sluggish price adjustment to more nuanced technological news.","['Charles M.C.

How effective are trading pauses?,"Exploiting Nasdaq order book data and difference-in-differences methodology, we identify the distinct effects of trading pause mechanisms introduced on US stock exchanges after May 2010. We show that the mere existence of such a regulation makes market participants behave differently in anticipation of a pause. Pauses enhance price discovery during the break but have adverse effects on price stability and liquidity after the pause. We find that pauses ultimately do not “cool off” markets but cause extra volatility. This implies a regulatory trade-off between the protective role of trading pauses and their adverse effects on market quality.","['Nikolaus Hautsch', 'Akos Horvath']","['Trading pause', '“Magnet\xa0effect”', 'Price discovery', 'Volatility', 'Liquidity']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302356,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,2
Firing the wrong workers: Financing constraints and labor misallocation,"Firms consider wages, current and expected productivity, as well as firing and hiring costs when firing a worker. Financing constraints distort this intertemporal trade-off, leading firms to sub-optimally fire short-tenured workers with high future expected productivity. We provide empirical evidence of this distortion using matched employer-employee data from the Swedish population between 2000 and 2010. We propose a new empirical strategy that uses credit ratings to identify financing constraints and uses exchange rates and trade data to identify demand shocks. Our empirical results identify an important new misallocation effect of financial frictions that operates within firms across different types of workers.","['Andrea Caggese', 'Vicente Cuñat', 'Daniel Metzger']","['Labor misallocation', 'Firing decisions', 'Financing constraints']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1830206X,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,3
Financing intangible capital,"Firms finance intangible investment through employee compensation contracts. In a dynamic model in which intangible capital is embodied in a firm’s employees, we analyze the firm’s optimal decisions on intangible capital investment, employee compensation contracts, and financial leverage. Employee financing is achieved by delaying wage payments in the form of future claims. We show that intangible capital investment is highly correlated with employee financing but not with debt issuance or regular equity refinancing. In our quantitative analysis, we show that this new channel of employee financing explains the cross-industry differences in leverage and financing patterns.","['Qi Sun', 'Mindy Z.

The role of executive cash bonuses in providing individual and team incentives,"Given CEOs’ substantial equity portfolios, much recent literature on CEO incentives regards cash-based bonus plans as largely irrelevant, begging the question of why nearly all CEO compensation plans include such bonuses. We develop a new measure of bonus plan incentives and show that performance sensitivities are much greater than prior estimates. We also test hypotheses regarding the role of bonuses in providing executives with individualized and team incentives. We find little evidence supporting the individualized incentives hypotheses but find consistent evidence that bonus plans appear to be used to encourage mutual monitoring and to facilitate coordination across the top management team as a whole.","['Wayne R.

Public hedge funds,"Hedge funds managed by listed firms significantly under-perform funds managed by unlisted firms. The under-performance is more severe for funds with low manager deltas, poor governance, and no manager co-investment, or those managed by firms whose prices are sensitive to earnings news. Notwithstanding the under-performance, listed asset management firms raise more capital, by growing existing funds and launching new funds post listing, and harvest greater fee revenues than do comparable unlisted firms. The results are consistent with the view that, for asset management firms, going public weakens the alignment between ownership, control, and investment capital, thereby engendering conflicts of interest.","['Lin Sun', 'Melvyn Teo']","['Hedge funds', 'Asset management', 'Initial public offering', 'Agency', 'Conflicts of interest']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302563,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,1
What’s in a (school) name? Racial discrimination in higher education bond markets,"Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) pay higher underwriting fees to issue tax-exempt bonds, compared with similar non-HBCUs, apparently reflecting higher costs of finding willing buyers. The effect is three times larger in the Deep South, where racial animus remains the most severe. Credit quality plays little role. For example, identical differences are observed between HBCU and non-HBCUs with AAA ratings or when insured by the same company, even before the 2007–2009 financial crisis. HBCU-issued bonds are also more expensive to trade in secondary markets and, when they do, sit in dealer inventory longer.","['Casey Dougal', 'Pengjie Gao', 'William J. Mayew', 'Christopher A.

Disaster on the horizon: The price effect of sea level rise,"Homes exposed to sea level rise (SLR) sell for approximately 7% less than observably equivalent unexposed properties equidistant from the beach. This discount has grown over time and is driven by sophisticated buyers and communities worried about global warming. Consistent with causal identification of long-horizon SLR costs, we find no relation between SLR exposure and rental rates and a 4% discount among properties not projected to be flooded for almost a century. Our findings contribute to the literature on the pricing of long-run risky cash flows and provide insights for optimal climate change policy.","['Asaf Bernstein', 'Matthew T.

Bankruptcy spillovers,"How do different bankruptcy approaches affect the local economy? Using US Census microdata, we explore the spillover effects of reorganization and liquidation on geographically proximate firms. We exploit the random assignment of bankruptcy judges as a source of exogenous variation in the probability of liquidation. We find that employment declines substantially in the immediate neighborhood of the liquidated establishments, relative to reorganized establishments. The spillover effects are highly localized and concentrate in nontradable and service sectors, consistent with a reduction in local consumer traffic and a decline in knowledge spillovers between firms. The evidence highlights the externalities that bankruptcy design can impose on nonbankrupt firms.","['Shai Bernstein', 'Emanuele Colonnelli', 'Xavier Giroud', 'Benjamin Iverson']","['Bankruptcy', 'Agglomeration', 'Local economy']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302733,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,3
Collateralizing liquidity,"I develop a dynamic model of optimal funding to understand why financial assets are used as collateral instead of being sold to raise funds. Firms need funds to invest in risky projects with nonobservable returns. Since holding these assets allows firms to raise these funds, investing firms value the asset more than noninvesting ones. When assets are less than perfectly liquid and investment opportunities are persistent, collateralized debt minimizes asset transfers from investing to noninvesting firms and thus is optimal. Frictions in asset markets lead to an illiquidity discount and a collateral premium, which increase with the asset’s illiquidity.",['Cecilia Parlatore'],"['Collateral', 'Liquidity', 'Optimal contracts', 'Private information']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302253,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,2
New goods and asset prices,"I extend the consumption capital asset pricing model to incorporate expanding product variety over time and states of nature. In the model, consumers have a love of variety, and consumption consists of different components: product groups and brands. By raising future marginal utility, growth in product groups increases the incentive to save and reduces the risk-free rate. By making marginal utility more volatile, variation in brand and quality growth magnifies consumption risk and raises the equity premium. Embedding new goods in a long-run risk setting has similar implications.",['Paul Scanlon'],"['Equity premium', 'Innovation', 'New product introduction', 'Risk-free rate']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303143,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,3
The profitability and investment premium: Pre-1963 evidence,"I investigate the profitability and investment premium in stock returns using hand-collected data from Moody's Manuals for 1940–1963. Controlling for value, the profitability premium emerges as important in this period. In contrast, there is no reliable relation between investment and returns, regardless of whether investment is measured using growth in total assets or book equity and even after extending the data back to 1926. In spanning regressions, factors constructed from profitability and book-to-market ratios (RMW and HML, respectively) improve the mean-variance efficient tangency portfolio but the investment factor (CMA) does not.",['Sunil Wahal'],"['Asset pricing', 'Multifactor models', 'Dividend discount model', 'Profitability', 'Investment']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302599,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,2
Dividend payments as a response to peer influence,"I show dividend policies have peer effects. My estimates indicate that firms speed up the time taken to make a dividend change by about 1.5 quarters and increase payments by 16% in response to peer changes. The peer effects matter in increases but not decreases. In contrast to dividends, repurchases show no peer effects. In addition, announcement returns indicate that investors partially anticipate the consequences of peer effects.

Acquirer reference prices and acquisition performance,"In a comprehensive sample of mergers and acquisitions, we find a reference price effect: acquirers earn higher (lower) announcement-period returns when their pre-announcement stock prices are well below (near) their 52-week highs. This reference price effect is stronger in acquisitions of private targets, deals involving greater uncertainty, and acquirers with greater individual investor ownership, and it is reversed in the subsequent year. Further, acquirer reference prices affect bid premia and target announcement-period returns in deals with greater uncertainty in acquirer valuation. The overall evidence is consistent with investors irrationally using 52-week high prices as a measure of acquirer valuation.","['Qingzhong Ma', 'David A.

Dynamic corporate liquidity,"In contrast to cash holdings, credit lines give firms financial flexibility by providing liquidity contingent on realized funding needs, but they are often limited by collateral and covenants. We embed this trade-off into an estimated dynamic model of financing and investment. Our model highlights the relevance of drawing down credit lines to fund investment options in an effective way and quantitatively matches well the levels and dynamics of cash, credit lines, and leverage. In the cross-section, modeling credit lines as contingent liquidity provides novel empirical predictions and rationalizes several stylized facts regarding credit line usage, covenant violations, and cash holdings.","['Boris Nikolov', 'Lukas Schmid', 'Roberto Steri']","['Cash', 'Credit lines', 'Collateral', 'Covenants', 'Structural estimation']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302824,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,1
What a difference a (birth) month makes: The relative age effect and fund manager performance,"Many US states have a single cutoff date for school entry, meaning that some children are older than others when they begin kindergarten. We show that this variation in birth months is associated with differences in adult labor market outcomes in the mutual fund industry. Relatively older managers (i.e., those born just after the cutoff) make better stock selections, and their funds outperform their younger peers’ funds by 0.48% per annum. This difference is linked to increased confidence. Survey respondents judge relatively older managers as appearing more confident in photographs, and these managers display more confident behavior: making larger bets, window dressing their holdings less, and securing more fund flows conditional on performance.","['John (Jianqiu) Bai', 'Linlin Ma', 'Kevin A.

Selection versus talent effects on firm value,"Measuring the value of labor-market hires for stock prices, be it underwriters when firms go public (IPOs) or chief executive officers (CEOs), is difficult due to selection. Opaque firms with higher costs of capital benefit more from prestigious underwriters, while productive firms benefit more from talented CEOs. Using assignment models, we show that the importance of talent (or agent heterogeneity) relative to selection (or firm heterogeneity) is measured by wage increases across agents of different compensation ranks divided by changes in output across their firms. The median of this ratio is 0.5% for underwriters and 2% for CEOs.","['Briana Chang', 'Harrison Hong']","['CEO', 'Underwriters', 'IPO Underpricing', 'Prestige', 'Talent', 'Selection', 'Sorting']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300017,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,3
Option prices and costly short-selling,"Much empirical evidence shows that stock short-selling costs and bans have significant effects on option prices. We reconcile these findings by providing a dynamic analysis of option prices with costly short-selling and option market makers. We obtain simple, closed-form, unique option bid and ask prices that represent option market makers’ expected hedging costs, and are weighted averages of well-known benchmark prices (Black–Scholes, Heston). Our analysis delivers rich implications that support the empirical evidence on the effects of short-selling costs and bans on option prices, as well as uncovering several novel predictions.

Cross-sectional alpha dispersion and performance evaluation,"Our paper explores the link between cross-sectional fund return dispersion and performance evaluation. The foundation of our model is the simple intuition that in periods of high return dispersion, which is associated with high levels of idiosyncratic risk for zero-alpha funds, unskilled managers can more easily disguise themselves as skilled. Rational investors should be more skeptical and apply larger discounts to reported performance in high dispersion environments. Our empirical results are consistent with this prediction. Using fund flow data, we show that a one standard deviation increase in cross-sectional return dispersion is associated with an 11% to 17% decline in flow-performance sensitivity. The effect is stronger for recent data and among outperforming funds.","['Campbell R.

Municipal borrowing costs and state policies for distressed municipalities,"Policies on financially distressed municipalities differ across US states, with some allowing unconditional access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy (Chapter 9 states) and others having proactive policies to assist distressed municipalities (Proactive states). These differences significantly affect borrowing costs. In Chapter 9 states, local municipal bond yields are higher, more cyclical, and more sensitive to default events than Proactive states. Default events have a contagion effect in Chapter 9 states, but not Proactive states. Lower local borrowing costs in Proactive states come at the expense of the state via higher intergovernmental revenue transfers in times of weak economic conditions.","['Pengjie Gao', 'Chang Lee', 'Dermot Murphy']","['Default risk', 'Government policy', 'Municipal bonds', 'Creditor protections']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1830299X,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,2
Do private equity funds manipulate reported returns?,"Private equity funds hold assets that are hard to value. Managers have incentives to distort reported valuations if these reports are used by investors to decide on commitments to subsequent funds. Using a large dataset of buyout and venture funds, we test for the presence of return manipulations. We find that some underperforming managers inflate reported returns during fundraising. However, those managers are less likely to raise a next fund, suggesting that investors can see through the manipulation. In contrast, top-performing funds appear to understate valuations.

Decision fatigue and heuristic analyst forecasts,"Psychological evidence indicates that decision quality declines after an extensive session of decision-making, a phenomenon known as decision fatigue. We study whether decision fatigue affects analysts’ judgments. Analysts cover multiple firms and often issue several forecasts in a single day. We find that forecast accuracy declines over the course of a day as the number of forecasts the analyst has already issued increases. Also consistent with decision fatigue, we find that the more forecasts an analyst issues, the higher the likelihood the analyst resorts to more heuristic decisions by herding more closely with the consensus forecast, self-herding (i.e., reissuing their own previous outstanding forecasts), and issuing a rounded forecast. Finally, we find that the stock market understands these effects and discounts for analyst decision fatigue.","['David Hirshleifer', 'Yaron Levi', 'Ben Lourie', 'Siew Hong Teoh']","['Analysts', 'Decision fatigue', 'Heuristic', 'Behavioral finance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300054,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,1
A large-scale approach for evaluating asset pricing models,"Recent studies show that the standard test portfolios do not contain sufficient information to discriminate between asset pricing models. To address this issue, we develop a large-scale approach that expands the cross-section to several thousand portfolios. Our novel approach is simple, widely applicable, and allows for formal evaluation/comparison tests. Its benefits are confirmed in empirical tests of CAPM- and characteristic-based models. While these models are all misspecified, we uncover striking performance differences between them. In particular, the human capital and conditional CAPMs largely outperform the CAPM, which suggests that labor income and time-varying recession risks are primary concerns for investors.",['Laurent Barras'],"['Asset pricing', 'Model comparison', 'Large cross-section']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301217,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,3
"Inverted fee structures, tick size, and market quality","Stock exchanges compete for order flow through their fee models. A traditional model pays rebates to liquidity suppliers, and an inverted model pays rebates to liquidity demanders. Using a regulatory intervention to examine the interaction between tick size, restrictions on dark trading, and exchange fees, we show that traders use inverted venues to adjust for suboptimal tick sizes. Increased inverted venue activity improves pricing efficiency and liquidity, especially when the tick size is binding. We show that the sub-tick price improvement offered by inverted venues enhances competition for liquidity provision and increases information impounded into prices through nonmarketable limit orders.","['Carole Comerton-Forde', 'Vincent Grégoire', 'Zhuo Zhong']","['Exchange fees', 'Inverted venues', 'Dark trading']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300595,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,1
Preference for dividends and return comovement,"Stocks that initiate dividends tend to comove more with other dividend-paying stocks and comove less with non-dividend payers. This is also true for: (a) dividend initiations that are motivated by the exogenous 2003 dividend tax cut; and (b) the cash dividend share class of Citizens Utilities (relative to its stock dividend class). We find that flows to dividend prone (averse) mutual funds increase the comovement among dividend-paying (non-dividend paying) stocks. Overall, the evidence supports the proposition that the trading of pro-dividend (dividend-averse) clienteles induces an extra factor in dividend payers (non-payers), beyond those associated with changes in common factors.","['Allaudeen Hameed', 'Jing Xie']","['Dividend', 'Dividend clientele', 'Comovement', 'Style investing']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302769,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,1
The value of collateral in trade finance,"Suppliers are subject to the credit risk of their customers when they sell products on credit. However, rights to the collateral value of the products they sell may mitigate some of this risk. This paper demonstrates the important role of laws that support suppliers’ rights to reclaim and liquidate collateral. Using a change in the US bankruptcy code that altered the rights of a subset of suppliers, I use a difference-in-differences setting to show that an improvement in suppliers’ rights to the liquidation value of collateral results in an increase in the amount and duration of trade credit offered. The increase in collateral protection also reduced suppliers’ lending standards, resulting in more dispersed trade credit lending and riskier customer portfolios. Finally, I find that the increase in collateral rights decreased suppliers’ incentives to monitor their customers, consistent with collateral and monitoring being substitutes. Overall, the paper shows that with strong legal protections in place, trade credit has an important collateral component.",['Anna M.

Pay now or pay later? The economics within the private equity partnership,"The economics of partnerships have been of enduring interest to economists, yet it is not clear what profit sharing within a private partnership should look like. We examine over 700 private equity partnerships and show that the allocation of fund economics to individual partners varies drastically, even among the most senior partners, and appears divorced from past success as an investor, being instead related to status as a founder. A smaller share of carried interest and ownership—and inequality in fund economics more generally—is associated with departures of senior partners which, in turn is negatively related to the funds’ ability to raise additional capital.","['Victoria Ivashina', 'Josh Lerner']","['Partnerships', 'Venture capital', 'Leveraged buyout']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302058,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,1

Our model provides theoretical support for the use of firm-level labor share as a measure of labor leverage.

Should investors learn about the timing of equity risk?,"The term structure of equity risk has been shown to be downward sloping. We capture this feature using return dynamics driven by both a transitory and a permanent component. We study the asset allocation and portfolio performance when transitory and permanent components cannot be observed and therefore need to be estimated. Strategies that account for the observed timing of equity risk outperform those that do not, particularly so out of sample. Indeed, the mean (median) certainty equivalent return increases from about 13% (12%) to about 21% (15%) because properly modeling the timing of equity risk implies surges in portfolio returns.","['Michael Hasler', 'Mariana Khapko', 'Roberto Marfè']","['Portfolio choice', 'Learning', 'Short-term risks', 'Long-term risks']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303209,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,3

Directors facing dissent are more likely to depart boards, especially if they are not lead directors or chairs of important committees. Directors facing dissent who do not leave are moved to less prominent positions on boards.

Institutions are motivated by both financial and social returns. Investors increase firms’ E&S performance following shocks that reveal financial benefits to E&S improvements. In cross section, investors increase firms’ E&S performance when they come from countries with a strong community belief in the importance of E&S issues, but not otherwise.

We find that manager sentiment is a strong negative predictor of future aggregate stock market returns, with monthly in-sample and out-of-sample R2s of 9.75% and 8.38%, respectively, which is far greater than the predictive power of other previously studied macroeconomic variables. Its predictive power is economically comparable and is informationally complementary to existing measures of investor sentiment. Higher manager sentiment precedes lower aggregate earnings surprises and greater aggregate investment growth. Moreover, manager sentiment negatively predicts cross-sectional stock returns, particularly for firms that are difficult to value and costly to arbitrage.","['Fuwei Jiang', 'Joshua Lee', 'Xiumin Martin', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Manager sentiment', 'Textual tone', 'Investor sentiment', 'Asset pricing', 'Return predictability']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302770,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,1

Full ownership is optimal when the first unit has positive debt, because dividends help avoid its default. Positive debt is, in turn, optimal when its corporate tax rate exceeds a threshold, and/or thin capitalization rules place an upper limit on the debt level in the second unit, and/or the Volcker Rule bans bailout transfers to the second unit. Full ownership is no longer optimal only if there is a tax on intercorporate dividend.

Does skin-in-the-game affect security performance?,This paper documents that complex financial innovations like collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) enabled informed parties in the commercial mortgage-backed securitization pipeline to reduce their skin-in-the-game in a way not observable to other market participants. This reduction in first-loss security retention significantly impacted the probability that more senior tranches ultimately defaulted. We show that this performance is entirely driven by the amount of first-loss sold to (affiliated) CDOs within 12 months of the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) deal. Our result is robust to using the differential access of first-loss investors to CDO funding as an instrument to identify exogenous variations in the retention of first-loss securities.,"['Adam B Ashcraft', 'Kunal Gooriah', 'Amir Kermani']","['Collateralized debt obligations', 'Risk retention', 'Asymmetric information']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301096,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,2
Trade credit and supplier competition,"This paper examines how competition among suppliers affects their willingness to provide trade credit financing. Trade credit extended by a supplier to a cash constrained retailer allows the latter to increase cash purchases from its other suppliers, leading to a free rider problem. A supplier that represents a smaller share of the retailer’s purchases internalizes a smaller part of the benefit from increased spending by the retailer and, as a result, extends less trade credit relative to its sales. In consequence, retailers with dispersed suppliers obtain less trade credit than those whose suppliers are more concentrated. The free rider problem is especially detrimental to a trade creditor when the free-riding suppliers are its product market competitors, leading to a negative relation between product substitutability among suppliers to a given retailer and trade credit that the former provide to the latter. We test the model using both simulated and real data. The estimated relations are consistent with the model’s predictions and are statistically and economically significant.","['Jiri Chod', 'Evgeny Lyandres', 'S.

Volatility and the cross-section of corporate bond returns,"This paper examines the pricing of volatility risk and idiosyncratic volatility in the cross-section of corporate bond returns for the period of 1994–2016. Results show that bonds with high volatility betas have low expected returns, and this negative relation appears in all segments of corporate bonds. Further, bonds with high idiosyncratic bond (stock) volatility have high (low) expected returns, and this relation strengthens as ratings decrease. Conventional risk factors and bond/issuer characteristics cannot account for these cross-sectional relations. There is evidence that the effect of idiosyncratic stock volatility on expected bond returns works through the channel of contemporaneous stock returns.","['Kee H.

Even signers of RMBS deals with high loss and misreporting rates or deals implicated in lawsuits experienced no adverse internal or external labor market outcomes.

Costs and benefits of financial conglomerate affiliation: Evidence from hedge funds,"This paper explores how affiliation to financial conglomerates affects asset managers’ access to capital, risk taking, and performance. Focusing on a sample of hedge funds, we find that financial conglomerate-affiliated hedge funds (FCAHFs) have lower flow-performance sensitivity than other hedge funds and that this difference is particularly pronounced during financial turmoil. Arguably, thanks to more stable funding, FCAHFs allow their investors to redeem capital more freely and are able to capture price rebounds. Because investors could value these characteristics, our findings provide a rationale for why financial conglomerate affiliation is widespread, although it slightly hampers performance on average.","['Francesco Franzoni', 'Mariassunta Giannetti']","['Hedge funds', 'Financial conglomerates', 'Risk taking']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301084,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,2
An anatomy of the market return,"This paper introduces a model free decomposition of S&P 500 forward market index returns in terms of realized and implied dispersion, downside, and tail risk using option portfolios. The decomposition lends itself by construction to learn about the different sources of risk in the market return and subsequently to visual and formal diagnosing of asset pricing models. It utilizes a novel conditional frequency analysis on the basis of available options rather than the times series of the S&P 500. Empirically, downside risk accounts for most of the forward market return, while symmetric tail risk is not prominently featured. The predictable, persistent part of the realized return is small. Nevertheless, signals revealed by this risk anatomy provide predictive out of sample power for realized returns, in particular for longer maturities. Furthermore, it indicates that models with identically and independently distributed state variables are generally misspecified in this market, and that care must be taken when calibrating disaster risk models. A formal test based on the risk anatomy rejects a model with time-varying disaster intensity.",['Paul Schneider'],"['Equity premium', 'Conditional', 'Frequency analysis', 'Skewness', 'Downside risk']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303052,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,2
Variance risk in aggregate stock returns and time-varying return predictability,"This paper introduces a new out-of-sample forecasting methodology for monthly market returns using the variance risk premium (VRP) that is both statistically and economically significant. This methodology is motivated by the ‘beta representation,’ which implies that the market risk premium is related to the price of variance risk by the variance risk exposure. Hence, when the slope of the contemporaneous regression of market returns on variance innovation is larger, future returns are more sharply related to the current VRP. Also, predictions are more accurate when market returns are highly correlated to variance shocks.",['Sungjune Pyun'],"['Variance risk premium', 'Leverage effect', 'Return predictability', 'Beta representation', 'Contemporaneous beta approach']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302782,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,1
The impact of jumps on carry trade returns,"This paper investigates how jump risks are priced in currency markets. We find that currencies whose changes are more sensitive to negative market jumps provide significantly higher expected returns. The positive risk premium constitutes compensation for the extreme losses during periods of market turmoil. Using the empirical findings, we propose a jump modified carry trade strategy, which has approximately two-percentage-point (per annum) higher returns than the regular carry trade strategy. These findings result from the fact that negative jump betas are significantly related to the riskiness of currencies and business conditions.","['Suzanne S.

Too good to be true? Fallacies in evaluating risk factor models,"This paper is concerned with statistical inference and model evaluation in possibly misspecified and unidentified linear asset pricing models estimated by maximum likelihood. Strikingly, when spurious factors (that is, factors that are uncorrelated with the returns on the test assets) are present, the model exhibits perfect fit, as measured by the squared correlation between the model’s fitted expected returns and the average realized returns. Furthermore, factors that are spurious are selected with high probability, and factors that are useful are driven out of the model. While ignoring potential misspecification and lack of identification can be very problematic for models with macroeconomic factors, empirical specifications with traded factors (e.g., Fama and French, 1993; Hou et al., 2015) do not suffer from the identification problems shown in this study.","['Nikolay Gospodinov', 'Raymond Kan', 'Cesare Robotti']","['Asset pricing', 'Spurious risk factors', 'Unidentified models', 'Model misspecification', 'Maximum likelihood', 'Goodness of fit', 'Rank test']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303027,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,2

Lenders are insulated from dealers through their repo’s collateral, but borrowers are exposed to dealers through the loss of their collateral. This makes lenders’ repo terms insensitive to dealers’ default, while borrowers’ repo terms are not. The model shows that when repos serve to intermediate collateral, haircuts are negative.

The relevance of broker networks for information diffusion in the stock market,"This paper shows that the network of relationships between brokers and institutional investors shapes information diffusion in the stock market. Central brokers gather information by executing informed trades, which is then leaked to their best clients. After large informed trades, other institutional investors are significantly more likely to execute similar trades through the same broker, allowing them to capture returns that are twice as large as their normal trading performance. Also indicative of information leakage, the clients of the broker employed by activist investors to execute their trades buy the same stocks just before the filing of the 13D.","['Marco Di Maggio', 'Francesco Franzoni', 'Amir Kermani', 'Carlo Sommavilla']","['Broker networks', 'Institutional investors', 'Asset prices', 'Information leakage']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930087X,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,2

Specifically, it considers a general equilibrium model where an ambiguity-averse agent applies a discount rate that is adjusted not only for the current magnitude of ambiguity but also for the risk associated with its future fluctuations. As such, both the ambiguity level and volatility help to raise the asset premiums and accommodate richer dynamics of asset prices. Based on a novel empirical measure of the ambiguity level, the estimated model can capture the empirical levels of corporate credit spreads and the equity premium while endogenously matching the historical default probability.

Corporate control activism,"This paper studies the role of activist investors in the market for corporate control. Our theory proposes that activist investors have an inherent advantage relative to bidders in pressuring entrenched incumbents to sell. As counterparties to the acquisition, bidders have a fundamental conflict of interests with target shareholders from which activist investors are immune. Therefore, unlike activists, the ability of bidders to win proxy fights is very limited. This result is consistent with the large number of activist campaigns that have resulted with the target’s sale to a third party and the evidence that most proxy fights are launched by activists, not by bidders.","['Adrian Aycan Corum', 'Doron Levit']","['Acquisition', 'Corporate governance', 'Proxy fight', 'Shareholder activism', 'Takeover']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300236,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,1

The effect of bank monitoring on public bond terms,"This study examines the effect of bank loan monitoring on public bond contract design. We find that bond yield spreads are lower and that bond issuance amounts are larger when a borrower has recently obtained a private loan, consistent with bond issuers benefiting from the screening and ongoing monitoring of banks. We find that these bonds include more covenants than bonds issued without the cross-monitoring of banks, consistent with bondholders wanting to protect themselves from private lenders. This effect is larger for firms with high information asymmetry and larger potential conflicts between different lender types. Our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests. Overall, our empirical results suggest that borrowers that precede their public bond issuances with private loan agreements receive more favorable bond terms. Meanwhile, these benefits are associated with the cost of increased monitoring by public bonds.","['Zhiming Ma', 'Derrald Stice', 'Christopher Williams']","['Debt contracting', 'Public bonds', 'Private loans', 'Bank monitoring']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930025X,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,2

Consequently, mood affects state-level job creation and new business starts, especially during periods of greater economic uncertainty.

In search of preference shock risks: Evidence from longevity risks and momentum profits,"Time-preference shocks affect agents’ preferences for assets with different durations. We consider longevity risk as a source of time-preference shocks and model it in the recursive preferences setting. This implies a consumption-based three-factor model, including longevity risk, consumption growth rate, and the market portfolio, where longevity has a negative price of risk. Empirically, this model explains many well-known cross-sectional portfolios. Notably, we find that longevity risk and the momentum factor share a common business cycle component, i.e., short-run consumption risks.

Empirical tests of asset pricing models with individual assets: Resolving the errors-in-variables bias in risk premium estimation,"To attenuate an inherent errors-in-variables bias, portfolios are widely employed to test asset pricing models; but portfolios might mask relevant risk- or return-related features of individual stocks. We propose an instrumental variables approach that allows the use of individual stocks as test assets, yet delivers consistent estimates of ex post risk premiums. This estimator also yields well-specified tests in small samples. The market risk premium under the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the liquidity-adjusted CAPM, premiums on risk factors under the Fama–French three- and five-factor models, and the Hou et al. (2015) four-factor model are all insignificant after controlling for asset characteristics.","['Narasimhan Jegadeesh', 'Joonki Noh', 'Kuntara Pukthuanthong', 'Richard Roll', 'Junbo Wang']","['Risk premium estimation', 'Errors-in-variables bias', 'Instrumental variables', 'Individual stocks', 'Asset pricing models']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300431,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,2
Minimum payments and debt paydown in consumer credit cards,"Using a data set covering one quarter of the U.S. general-purpose credit card market, we document that 29% of accounts regularly make payments at or near the minimum payment. To explain the prevalence of low payment amounts, we exploit changes in issuers’ minimum payment formulas to quantify the explanatory power of two potential theories: liquidity constraints and anchoring. At least 22% of near-minimum payers (and 9% of all accounts) respond to the formula changes in a manner consistent with anchoring as opposed to liquidity constraints alone. Our results show that anchoring to a salient contractual term has a significant impact on household repayment decisions.","['Benjamin J.

Do firms hedge with foreign currency derivatives for employees?,"Using a sample of 3004 US firm-years with foreign sales, we provide the first evidence that a firm's employee treatment score is an important determinant of its fraction of foreign sales hedged with currency-based derivatives. The positive relation between employee treatment rating and currency hedging activity is driven by firms operating in competitive industries, businesses with relatively unique products or assets, and companies adopting aggressive business strategies. These results suggest that firms with foreign sales tend to factor employee benefits in their currency hedging policies when their acquisition, development, and retention of human capital are especially costly or highly valued.","['Pinghsun Huang', 'Hsin-Yi Huang', 'Yan Zhang']","['Currency hedging', 'Employee treatment', 'Human capital']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300212,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,2
Private information in currency markets,"Using daily abnormal currency returns for the universe of countries with flexible exchange rates, we show local currency depreciations ahead of unscheduled, public sovereign debt downgrade announcements. Consistent with the private information hypothesis, the effect is stronger in lower institutional quality countries and holds after we control for concurrent public information and for publicly available rumors about the forthcoming downgrades. Our results persist when abnormal currency returns are adjusted for global carry and dollar risk factors, world equity and bond returns, as well as local stock market returns.

Do firms issue more equity when markets become more liquid?,"Using quarterly data on initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) for 37 countries from 1995 to 2014, we show that changes in equity issuance are positively related to lagged changes in aggregate local stock market liquidity. This relation is as economically significant as the well-known relation between equity issuance and lagged stock returns. It survives the inclusion of proxies for market timing, capital market conditions, growth prospects, asymmetric information, and investor sentiment.

High frequency trading and comovement in financial markets,"Using the staggered entry of Chi-X in 12 European equity markets as a source of exogenous variation in high frequency trading (HFT), we find that HFT causes significant increases in comovement in returns and in liquidity. About one-third of the increase in return comovement is due to faster diffusion of market-wide information. We attribute the remaining two-thirds to correlated trading strategies of HFTs. The increase in liquidity comovement is consistent with HFT liquidity providers being better able to monitor other stocks and adjust their liquidity provision accordingly. Our findings suggest a channel by which HFT impacts the cost of capital.","['Laura Malceniece', 'Kārlis Malcenieks', 'Tālis J.

FIR is associated with higher returns and greater depth in the sovereign debt market after the rebalancings. Also, larger inflows (outflows) are associated with greater currency appreciations (depreciations).

Patent trolls and startup employment,"We analyze how frivolous patent infringement claims made by nonpracticing entities (NPEs, or “patent trolls”) affect startups’ ability to grow and create jobs, innovate, and raise capital. Our identification strategy exploits the staggered adoption of anti-troll laws in 32 US states. The laws lead to a 4.4% increase in employment at high-tech startups—an increase driven by IT firms, a frequent target of NPEs. Increased access to financing, both venture capital and patent-backed lending, is a key channel driving our findings.

Internalizing governance externalities: The role of institutional cross-ownership,"We analyze the role of institutional cross-ownership in internalizing corporate governance externalities using granular mutual fund proxy voting data. Exploiting within-proposal and within-institution variation, we show that an institution's holdings in peer firms are positively associated with the likelihood that the institution votes against management on shareholder-sponsored governance proposals. We further find that high aggregate cross-ownership positively predicts management losing a vote. Overall, our results provide evidence that cross-ownership incentivizes institutional investors to play a more active monitoring role, suggesting that institutional cross-ownership serves as a market-based mechanism to alleviate the inefficiency induced by governance externalities.","['Jie\xa0(Jack) He', 'Jiekun Huang', 'Shan Zhao']","['Corporate governance', 'Externalities', 'Cross-ownership', 'Proxy voting', 'Institutional investors']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300844,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,2
"Liquidity, innovation, and endogenous growth","We build a model of endogenous, innovation-driven growth in which innovative firms have costly access to outside financing and hoard cash reserves to maintain financial flexibility. We show that financing frictions slow down Schumpeterian creative destruction by discouraging entry. As a result, financing frictions importantly affect the composition of growth, by reducing the contribution of entrants but spurring the contribution of incumbents. We investigate the net impact of these countervailing effects on the equilibrium growth rate and welfare.","['Semyon Malamud', 'Francesca Zucchi']","['Innovation', 'Cash management', 'Financing frictions', 'Endogenous growth']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303106,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,2
Generalized recovery,"We characterize when physical probabilities, marginal utilities, and the discount rate can be recovered from observed state prices for several future time periods. We make no assumptions of the probability distribution, thus generalizing the time-homogeneous stationary model of Ross (2015). Recovery is feasible when the number of maturities with observable prices is higher than the number of states of the economy (or the number of parameters characterizing the pricing kernel). When recovery is feasible, our model allows a closed-form linearized solution.

Liquidity standards and the value of an informed lender of last resort,"We consider a dynamic model in which receiving support from the lender of last resort (LLR) may help banks to weather investor runs. We show the need for regulatory liquidity standards when the underlying social trade-offs make the uninformed LLR inclined to support troubled banks during a run. Liquidity standards increase the time available before the LLR must decide on supporting the bank. This facilitates the arrival of information on the bank’s financial condition and improves the efficiency of the decision taken by the LLR, a role that can be modified but not replaced with the use of capital regulation.","['João A.C.

Size and value in China,"We construct size and value factors in China. The size factor excludes the smallest 30% of firms, which are companies valued significantly as potential shells in reverse mergers that circumvent tight IPO constraints. The value factor is based on the earnings-price ratio, which subsumes the book-to-market ratio in capturing all Chinese value effects. Our three-factor model strongly dominates a model formed by just replicating the Fama and French (1993) procedure in China. Unlike that model, which leaves a 17% annual alpha on the earnings-price factor, our model explains most reported Chinese anomalies, including profitability and volatility anomalies.","['Jianan Liu', 'Robert F.

Counterparty credit risk and derivatives pricing,We derive a model with qualitative implications for options pricing under counterparty credit risk and provide empirical evidence using the data from the Hong Kong derivatives market during 2005–2014. We find that the log-price difference between a derivative warrant with counterparty credit risk and an otherwise identical option without counterparty credit risk is significantly and negatively associated with the credit default swap spread on the warrant issuer. We also find that the prices of out-of-the-money put warrants are more sensitive to credit risk than those of other warrants.

Economic and statistical significance are high and larger for year ahead than monthly predictions. The effect of news measures on market outcomes differs by country type and over time.

Factors can play double roles as both covariance-generating common shocks driving yields and determinants of market prices of risk in cross-sectional pricing. The evidence favors time-varying risk prices significantly related to the second Stock–Watson principal component of macroeconomic variables and to changes in the industrial production index.

Government debt and corporate leverage: International evidence,"We empirically investigate the impact of government debt on corporate financing decisions in an international setting. We show a negative relation between government debt and corporate leverage using data on 40 countries between 1990–2014. This negative relation is stronger for government debt that is financed domestically, for firms that are larger and more profitable, and in countries with more developed equity markets. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we use an instrumental variable approach based on military spending and a quasi-natural experiment based on the introduction of the Euro currency.

The information sensitivity of debt in good and bad times,"We empirically show the dynamics of information production and information sensitivity of bank debt around the Great Recession. As more precise information is produced at the onset of the crisis, bank debt becomes informationally sensitive, along two separate dimensions. First, precise information amplifies the effect of market expectations on default risk; second, for banks that are already expected to perform poorly, more precise information further increases default risk. Both effects are muted in good times.

We find that they contain valuable information on the risk-neutral conditional distributions of volatility at different time horizons, which is not spanned by the S&P 500 market. This information allows enhanced estimation of the variance risk premium. We gain new insights on the term structure of the variance risk premium, present a trading strategy exploiting these insights, and show how to improve S&P 500 return forecasts.","['Chris Bardgett', 'Elise Gourier', 'Markus Leippold']","['S&P 500 and VIX joint modeling', 'Volatility dynamics', 'Particle filter', 'Variance risk premium']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302605,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,3
"Probability of price crashes, rational speculative bubbles, and the cross-section of stock returns","We estimate an ex ante probability of extreme negative returns (crashes) of individual stocks as a measure of potential overpricing and find that stocks with a high probability of crashes earn abnormally low returns. Stocks with high crash probability are overpriced regardless of the level of institutional ownership or variations in investor sentiment, and moreover, they exhibit increasing institutional demand until their prices reach the peak of overvaluation. We also find that institutional investors who overweight high crash probability stocks outperform the others, indicating that they have skill in timing bubbles and crashes of individual stocks. Our findings imply that sophisticated investors may not always trade against mispricing but time the correction of overpricing, and suggest that the crash effect we find could arise at least partially from rational speculative bubbles, not entirely from sentiment-driven overpricing.","['Jeewon Jang', 'Jangkoo Kang']","['Price crashes', 'Overpricing', 'Anomalies', 'Institutional investors', 'Rational speculative bubbles']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302812,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,1
Entry and competition in takeover auctions,"We estimate the degree of uncertainty faced by potential bidders in takeover auctions and quantify how it affects prices in auctions and negotiations. The high degree of uncertainty revealed by our structural estimation encourages entry in auctions but reduces a target’s bargaining power in negotiations. In the aggregate, auctions and negotiations produce similar prices, even though auctions are preferred in takeover markets with high uncertainty, while the reverse is true for negotiations.

Based on US industry returns (1926‒2014) and international sector returns (1985‒2014), we present four findings (1) Fama is correct in that a sharp price increase of an industry portfolio does not, on average, predict unusually low returns going forward; (2) such sharp price increases predict a substantially heightened probability of a crash but not of a further price boom; (3) attributes of the price run-up, including volatility, turnover, issuance, and the price path of the run-up, help forecast an eventual crash; and (4) these attributes also help forecast future returns.

The value of access to finance: Evidence from M&As,"We examine synergies in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) generated by firms’ comparative advantages in access to bank finance. We find robust evidence that greater access to bank finance increases firms’ attractiveness as acquisition targets. Targets’ comparative advantage in bank finance improves bank credit supply and reduces financing costs for the merged firms. These effects are more pronounced for acquirers with greater frictions in accessing bank loans and acquirers with greater growth opportunities.

Institutional herding and its price impact: Evidence from the corporate bond market,"We examine the extent to which institutional investors herd in the U.S. corporate bond market and the price impact of their herding behavior. We find that the level of institutional herding in corporate bonds is substantially higher than what is documented for equities, and that sell herding is much stronger and more persistent than buy herding. The price impact of herding is also highly asymmetric. While buy herding facilitates price discovery, sell herding causes transitory yet large price distortions. Such price destabilizing effect of sell herding is particularly pronounced for speculative-grade, small, and illiquid bonds, and during the financial crisis.","['Fang Cai', 'Song Han', 'Dan Li', 'Yi Li']","['Corporate bond', 'Herding', 'Institutional investors', 'Return reversal']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301995,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,1
Institutional investor cliques and governance,"We examine the impact of investor coordination on governance. We identify coordinating groups of investors (cliques) as those connected through the network of institutional holdings. Clique members vote together on proxy items: a one standard deviation increase in clique ownership more than doubles votes against low quality management proposals. We use the 2003 mutual fund trading scandal to show that this effect is causal. These findings suggest coordination strengthens governance via voice. Coordination, however, also weakens governance via threat of exit. Clique owners exit positions more slowly, and firm value responds negatively to liquidity shocks when clique ownership is high.","['Alan D.

Transparency and dealer networks: Evidence from the initiation of post-trade reporting in the mortgage backed security market,"We examine the introduction of mandatory post-trade reporting in the To-Be-Announced mortgage-backed securities market. With post-trade reporting, trading costs fell for institutional investors. Trading costs declined more for investors’ trades with peripheral dealers than for their trades with core dealers. Peripheral dealers’ market share dropped after the introduction of post-trade reporting, suggesting that opacity was protecting inefficient high-cost dealers. Interdealer trades and volume declined as transparency made it easier to find natural counterparties. Relationships between dealers became less important and, after controlling for the number of trades, dealers used more counterparties in interdealer trades.","['Paul Schultz', 'Zhaogang Song']","['Dealer market', 'Transparency', 'Mortgage backed securities', 'Core-periphery']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300078,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,1
The rise in student loan defaults,"We examine the rise in student loan defaults in the Great Recession by linking administrative student loan data at the individual borrower level to student loan borrowers’ individual tax records. A Blinder-Oaxaca style decomposition shows that shifts in the composition of student loan borrowers and the massive collapse in home prices during the Great Recession can each account for approximately 30% of the rise in student loan defaults. Falling home prices affect student loan defaults by impairing individuals’ labor earnings, especially for low income jobs. By contrast, when comparing the default sensitivities of homeowners and renters, we find no evidence that falling home prices affect student loan defaults through a home equity-based liquidity channel. The Income Based Repayment (IBR) program introduced by the federal government in the wake of the Great Recession reduced both student loan defaults and their sensitivity to home price fluctuations, thus providing student loan borrowers with valuable insurance against negative shocks.","['Holger M.

Crowdsourced employer reviews and stock returns,"We find that firms experiencing improvements in crowdsourced employer ratings significantly outperform firms with declines. The return effect is concentrated among reviews from current employees, stronger among early firm reviews, and also stronger when the employee works in the headquarters state. Decomposing employer ratings, we find the return effect is related to changing employee assessments of Career Opportunities and views of senior management. It is unrelated to work-life balance. Employer rating changes are associated with growth in sales and profitability and help forecast one-quarter-ahead earnings announcement surprises. The evidence is consistent with employee reviews revealing fundamental information about the firm.","['T.

This relation holds in a range of robustness tests including those that address omitted variable bias and reverse causality. Additionally, social capital reduces the likelihood that firms make opportunistic option grant awards that unduly favor CEOs, including lucky awards, backdated awards, and unscheduled awards. Social capital also lessens the accretive effect of CEO power on CEO compensation.

Attention allocation and return co-movement: Evidence from repeated natural experiments,"We hypothesize that when investors pay less attention to financial markets, they rationally allocate relatively more attention to market-level information than to firm-specific information, leading to increases in stock return co-movements. Using large jackpot lotteries as exogenous shocks that attract investors’ attention away from the stock market, we find supportive evidence that stock returns co-move more with the market on large jackpot days. This effect is stronger for stocks preferred by retail investors and is not driven by gambling sentiment. We also find that stock returns are less sensitive to earnings surprises and co-move more with industries on large jackpot days.","['Shiyang Huang', 'Yulin Huang', 'Tse-Chun Lin']","['Lottery jackpots', 'Attention shocks', 'Attention allocation', 'Return co-movement', 'Earnings surprises']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302848,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,2

Common risk factors in the cross-section of corporate bond returns,"We investigate the cross-sectional determinants of corporate bond returns and find that downside risk is the strongest predictor of future bond returns. We also introduce common risk factors based on the prevalent risk characteristics of corporate bonds—downside risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk—and find that these novel bond factors have economically and statistically significant risk premiums that cannot be explained by long-established stock and bond market factors.

A tug of war: Overnight versus intraday expected returns,"We link investor heterogeneity to the persistence of the overnight and intraday components of returns. We document strong overnight and intraday firm-level return continuation along with an offsetting cross-period reversal effect, all of which lasts for years. We look for a similar tug of war in the returns of 14 trading strategies, finding in all cases that profits are either earned entirely overnight (for reversal and a variety of momentum strategies) or entirely intraday, typically with profits of opposite signs across these components. We argue that this tug of war should reduce the effectiveness of clienteles pursuing the strategy.

Optimal capital structure and bankruptcy choice: Dynamic bargaining versus liquidation,"We model a firm’s optimal capital structure decision in a framework in which it may later choose to enter either Chapter 11 reorganization or Chapter 7 liquidation. Creditors anticipate equityholders’ ex-post reorganization incentives and price them into the ex-ante credit spreads. Using a realistic dynamic bargaining model of reorganization, we show that the off-equilibrium threat of costly renegotiation can lead to lower leverage, even with liquidation in equilibrium. If reorganization is less efficient than liquidation, the added option of reorganization can actually make equityholders worse off ex-ante, even when they liquidate on the equilibrium path.","['Samuel Antill', 'Steven R.

Entrusted loans: A close look at China's shadow banking system,"We perform transaction-level analyses of entrusted loans, one of the largest components of shadow banking in China. Entrusted loans involve firms with privileged access to cheap capital channeling funds to less privileged firms, and the increase when credit is tight. Nonaffiliated loans have much higher interest rates than both affiliated loans and official bank loans, and they largely flow into real estate. The pricing of entrusted loans, especially of nonaffiliated loans, incorporates fundamental and informational risks. Stock market reactions suggest that both affiliated and nonaffiliated loans are fairly compensated investments.","['Franklin Allen', 'Yiming Qian', 'Guoqian Tu', 'Frank Yu']","['Shadow banking', 'Entrusted loans', 'Credit shortage', 'Fundamental risk', 'Informational risk']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300066,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,1
Characteristics are covariances: A unified model of risk and return,"We propose a new modeling approach for the cross section of returns. Our method, Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA), allows for latent factors and time-varying loadings by introducing observable characteristics that instrument for the unobservable dynamic loadings. If the characteristics/expected return relationship is driven by compensation for exposure to latent risk factors, IPCA will identify the corresponding latent factors. If no such factors exist, IPCA infers that the characteristic effect is compensation without risk and allocates it to an “anomaly” intercept. Studying returns and characteristics at the stock-level, we find that five IPCA factors explain the cross section of average returns significantly more accurately than existing factor models and produce characteristic-associated anomaly intercepts that are small and statistically insignificant. Furthermore, among a large collection of characteristics explored in the literature, only ten are statistically significant at the 1% level in the IPCA specification and are responsible for nearly 100% of the model’s accuracy.","['Bryan T.

Do insiders time management buyouts and freezeouts to buy undervalued targets?,"We provide evidence that managers and controlling shareholders time management buyouts (MBOs) and freezeout transactions to take advantage of industry-wide undervaluation. Portfolios of industry peers of MBO and freezeout targets show significant alphas of around 1% per month over the 12-month period following the transaction. These returns are not explained by a battery of risk factors or empirical methodologies, but exhibit significant heterogeneity across deals. Additional tests show that, on average, abnormal returns to industry peers are a reliable proxy for those to the target firm. Further, MBOs and freezeouts are announced during troughs of industry profitability.","['Jarrad Harford', 'Jared Stanfield', 'Feng Zhang']","['Management buyouts', 'Freezeout acquisitions', 'Market timing', 'Conflicts of interest']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302071,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,1
How valuable are independent directors? Evidence from external distractions,"We provide new evidence on the value of independent directors by exploiting exogenous events that seriously distract independent directors. Approximately 20% of independent directors are significantly distracted in a typical year. They attend fewer meetings, trade less frequently in the firm's stock, and resign from the board more frequently, indicating declining firm-specific knowledge and a reduced board commitment. Firms with more preoccupied independent directors have declining firm valuation and operating performance and exhibit weaker merger and acquisition (M&A) profitability and accounting quality. These effects are stronger when distracted independent directors play key board monitoring roles and when firms require greater director attention.","['Ronald W.

Financial frictions and employment during the Great Depression,"We provide new evidence that a disruption in credit supply played a quantitatively significant role in the unprecedented contraction of employment during the Great Depression using a novel, hand-collected dataset of large industrial firms. Our identification strategy exploits preexisting variation in the need to raise external funds at a time when public bond markets essentially froze. Local bank failures inhibited firms’ ability to substitute public debt for private debt, which exacerbated financial constraints. We estimate a large and negative causal effect of financing frictions on firm employment. We find that the lack of access to credit likely accounted for a substantial fraction of the aggregate decline in employment of large firms between 1928 and 1933.","['Efraim Benmelech', 'Carola Frydman', 'Dimitris Papanikolaou']","['Credit', 'Financial constraints', 'Labor', 'Unemployment', 'Great Depression']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300388,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,3
Indexing and stock market serial dependence around the world,"We show a striking change in index return serial dependence across 20 major market indexes covering 15 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. While many studies find serial dependence to be positive until the 1990s, it switches to negative since the 2000s. This change happens in most stock markets around the world and is both statistically significant and economically meaningful. Further tests reveal that the decline in serial dependence links to the increasing popularity of index products (e.g., futures, exchange-traded funds, and index mutual funds). The link between serial dependence and indexing is not driven by a time trend, holds up in the cross section of stock indexes, is confirmed by tests exploiting Nikkei 225 index weights and Standard & Poor’s 500 membership, and in part reflects the arbitrage mechanism between index products and the underlying stocks.","['Guido Baltussen', 'Sjoerd van Bekkum', 'Zhi Da']","['Return autocorrelation', 'Stock market indexing', 'Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)', 'Arbitrage']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302034,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,132,1
Channels of US monetary policy spillovers to international bond markets,"We show significant US monetary policy (MP) spillovers to international bond markets. Our methodology identifies US MP shocks as the change in short-term Treasury yields around Federal Open Market Committee meetings and traces their effects on international bond yields using panel regressions. We emphasize three main results. First, US MP spillovers to long-term yields have increased substantially after the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. Second, spillovers are large compared with the effects of other events, and at least as large as the effects of domestic MP after 2008. Third, spillovers work through different channels, concentrated in risk-neutral rates (expectations of future MP rates) for developed countries, but predominantly on term premia in emerging markets. In interpreting these findings, we provide evidence consistent with an exchange rate channel, according to which foreign central banks face a trade-off between narrowing MP rate differentials or experiencing currency movements against the US dollar. Developed countries adjust in a manner consistent with freely floating regimes, responding partially with risk-neutral rates and partially through currency adjustments. Instead, emerging countries display patterns consistent with foreign exchange interventions, which cushion the response of exchange rates but reinforce capital flows and their effects in bond yields through movements in term premia. Our results suggest that the endogenous effects of currency interventions on long-term yields should be added into the standard cost-benefit analysis of such policies.","['Elias Albagli', 'Luis Ceballos', 'Sebastian Claro', 'Damian Romero']","['Monetary policy spillovers', 'Risk-neutral rates', 'Term premia']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301072,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,2
Credit default swaps and corporate innovation,"We show that credit default swap (CDS) trading on a firm's debt positively influences its technological innovation output measured by patents and patent citations. This positive effect is more pronounced in firms relying more on debt financing or being more subject to continuous monitoring by lenders prior to CDS trade initiation. Moreover, after CDS trade initiation, firms pursue more risky and original innovations and generate patents with higher economic value. Further analysis suggests that CDSs improve borrowing firms’ innovation output by enhancing lenders’ risk tolerance and borrowers’ risk- taking in the innovation process, rather than by increasing Research and Development (R&D) investment. Taken together, our findings reveal the real effects of CDSs on companies’ investments and technological progress.","['Xin Chang', 'Yangyang Chen', 'Sarah Qian Wang', 'Kuo Zhang', 'Wenrui Zhang']","['Credit default swaps', 'Corporate innovation', 'Risk-taking', 'Financial innovation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300856,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,2
Do idiosyncratic jumps matter?,"We show that idiosyncratic jumps are a key determinant of mean stock returns from both an ex post and ex ante perspective. Ex post, the entire annual average return of a typical stock accrues on the four days on which its price jumps. Ex ante, idiosyncratic jump risk earns a premium: a value-weighted weekly long-short portfolio that buys (sells) stocks with high (low) predicted jump probabilities earns annualized mean returns of 9.4% and four-factor alphas of 8.1%. This strategy’s returns are larger when there are greater limits to arbitrage. These results are consistent with investor aversion to idiosyncratic jump risk.","['Nishad Kapadia', 'Morad Zekhnini']","['Idiosyncratic jumps', 'Idiosyncratic risk', 'Limits to arbitrage']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302393,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,3
Why did the q theory of investment start working?,"We show that the relation between aggregate investment and Tobin’s q has become remarkably tight in recent years, contrasting with earlier times. We connect this change with the growing empirical dispersion in Tobin’s q, which we show both in the cross-section and the time series. To study the source of this dispersion, we augment a standard investment model with two distinct mechanisms related to firms’ research activities: innovations and learning. Both innovation jumps in cash flows and the frequent updating of beliefs about future cash flows endogenously amplify volatility in the firm’s value function. Perhaps counterintuitively, the investment-q regression works better for research-intensive industries, a growing segment of the economy, despite their greater stock of intangible assets. We confirm the model’s predictions in the data, and we disentangle the results from measurement error in q.","['Daniel Andrei', 'William Mann', 'Nathalie Moyen']","['Investment', 'Tobin’s q', 'Research and development', 'Innovation', 'Learning']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300613,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,2
Regulating a model,"We study a situation in which a regulator relies on risk models that banks produce in order to regulate them. A bank can generate more than one model and choose which models to reveal to the regulator. The regulator can find out the other models by monitoring the bank, but in equilibrium, monitoring induces the bank to produce less information. We show that a high level of monitoring is desirable when the bank’s private gain from producing more information is either sufficiently high or sufficiently low. When public models are more precise, banks produce more information, but the regulator may end up monitoring more.","['Yaron Leitner', 'Bilge Yilmaz']","['Bank regulation', 'Bayesian persuasion', 'Information design', 'Internal-risk models', 'Model-based regulation', 'Stress tests']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302319,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,2
The present value relation over six centuries: The case of the Bazacle company,"We study asset pricing over the longue durée using share prices and net dividends from the Bazacle company of Toulouse, the earliest documented shareholding corporation. The data extend from the firm’s foundation in 1372 to its nationalization in 1946. We find an average dividend yield of 5% per annum and near-zero long-term, real capital appreciation. Stationary dividends and stock prices enable us to directly study how prices relate to expected cash flows, without relying on a rate of return transformation. A reduced-form asset pricing model with persistent dividends and a time-varying risk correction is not rejected by the data.","['David le Bris', 'William N.

Mutual fund board connections and proxy voting,"We study fund-firm connections that arise when firm executives and directors serve as fund directors. We find that connected funds are significantly more likely to vote with management in proposals with negative Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommendations or low shareholder support. As our data show that management support does not exist either before connection formation or after its termination, this result is unlikely to be caused by omitted factors. Rather, the connected fund's voting patterns show independence from ISS recommendations and successful connected voting is associated with positive announcement returns, suggesting that connected fund support for management reflects information advantages. Lastly, we find that a fund family and firm are more likely to connect when the fund family holds a large stake in the firm and is geographically proximate as well as when it has a record of voting independently from ISS.","['Paul Calluzzo', 'Simi Kedia']","['Proxy voting', 'Board connections', 'Mutual funds']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301126,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,134,3
"Good disclosure, bad disclosure","We study real-efficiency implications of disclosing public information in a model with multiple dimensions of uncertainty where market prices convey information to a real decision maker. Paradoxically, when disclosure concerns a variable that the real decision maker cares to learn about, disclosure negatively affects price informativeness, and in markets that are effective in aggregating private information, this negative price-informativeness effect can dominate so that better disclosure negatively impacts real efficiency. When disclosure concerns a variable that the real decision maker already knows much about, disclosure always improves price informativeness and real efficiency. Our analysis has important empirical and policy implications for different contexts such as disclosure of stress test information and regulation of credit ratings.","['Itay Goldstein', 'Liyan Yang']","['Disclosure', 'Price informativeness', 'Learning', 'Real efficiency']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302241,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,1
Interconnectedness in the interbank market,"We study the behavior of the interbank market around the 2008 financial crisis. Using network analysis, we study two network structures, correlation networks based on publicly traded bank returns and physical networks based on interbank lending transactions, among these public and also private banks. While the two networks behave similarly pre-crisis, during the crisis the correlation network shows an increase in interconnectedness, while the physical network highlights a marked decrease in interconnectedness. Moreover, these networks respond differently to monetary and macroeconomic shocks. Physical networks forecast liquidity problems, while correlation networks forecast financial crises.","['Celso Brunetti', 'Jeffrey H.

Firms’ innovation strategy under the shadow of analyst coverage,"We study the effect of analyst coverage on firms’ innovation strategy and outcome. Using data of US firms from 1990 to 2012, we find evidence that an increase in financial analysts leads firms to cut research and development expenses, acquire more innovative firms, and invest in corporate venture capital. We attribute the first result to the effect of analyst pressure and the others to the informational role of analysts. We also find that financial analysts encourage firms to make more efficient investments related to innovation, which increases their future patents and citations and influences the novelty of their innovations.","['Bing Guo', 'David Pérez-Castrillo', 'Anna Toldrà-Simats']","['Financial analysts', 'Innovation', 'Corporate venture capital', 'Acquisition']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302265,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,2
"Securitized markets, international capital flows, and global welfare","We study the effect of collateralized lending and securitization on international capital flows and welfare in a two-country general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic investment risk. The low-margin country (Home) endogenously supplies more safe assets and enables more risk sharing. Upon financial integration, capital flows from Foreign (high-margin country) to Home, leading to lower interest rates and a larger global supply of safe assets. Unlike in standard models with partial equity issuance, in our model, Home can lose from financial integration due to the endogenous reduction in risk sharing and aggregate shocks can generate large gross capital flows.","['Gregory Phelan', 'Alexis Akira Toda']","['Collateralized loan obligations', 'Endogenous risk sharing', 'Global imbalances', 'Gross international asset positions']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18302320,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,131,3

We disentangle the effects of the Stulz (2005) “twin agency problems” in the context of foreign direct investment and show that our results are not driven by legal institutions protecting investors from expropriation by corporate insiders.

Private equity and human capital risk,"We study the human capital effects of private equity buyouts in Germany. We conduct matched-sample difference-in-differences estimations at the establishment and at the individual employee level with more than 152 thousand buyout employees and a carefully matched control group. Buyouts are followed by a reduction in overall employment and an increase in employee turnover. Employees of buyout targets experience earnings declines equivalent to 2.8% of median earnings in the fifth year after the buyout. Managers and older employees fare far worse after buyouts compared with the average target employee, even though they are not more likely to lose their jobs at the target compared with other employees. We argue that the employees most negatively affected after buyouts are those who are less likely to find new employment, not those who are most likely to lose their jobs. Evidence exists of a reduction in administrative staff and more hiring for jobs that require IT skills.","['Manfred Antoni', 'Ernst Maug', 'Stefan Obernberger']","['Private equity', 'Restructuring', 'Human capital risk', 'Buyouts', 'Wages']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301102,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,3

A capital structure channel of monetary policy,"We study the transmission channels from central banks’ quantitative easing programs via the banking sector when central banks start purchasing corporate bonds. We find evidence consistent with a “capital structure channel” of monetary policy. The announcement of central bank purchases reduces the bond yields of firms whose bonds are eligible for central bank purchases. These firms substitute bank term loans with bond debt, thereby relaxing banks’ lending constraints: banks with low tier-1 ratios and high nonperforming loans increase lending to private (and profitable) firms, which experience a growth in investment. The credit reallocation increases banks’ risk-taking in corporate credit.","['Benjamin Grosse-Rueschkamp', 'Sascha Steffen', 'Daniel Streitz']","['Debt capital structure', 'Bond debt', 'Unconventional monetary policy', 'Quantitative easing', 'Real effects']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19300601,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,2

To do so, we identify accounts of industry insiders in a large data set provided by a retail discount broker. We find that insiders trade firms from their own industry more frequently. Furthermore, they earn abnormal returns exclusively when trading own-industry stocks, especially obscure stocks (small, low analyst coverage, high volatility). In a battery of tests, we find no evidence of the use of private information.

Experience derives from investments in banks that defaulted following the 2007–2009 financial crisis.

Agents bought their own houses at prices that are 2.54% lower than comparable houses bought by other buyers. Consistent with information asymmetries, agent buyers have more information advantages in less informative environments, and agent buyers are more likely to buy houses from agent sellers. Agent discounts are from both “cherry picking” and bargaining power, and bargaining power contributes more to the agent discounts.

Net fund flows are significantly greater among lockup funds during crisis and noncrisis periods. Managers of hedge funds with locked-up capital trade opportunistically against flow-motivated trades of non-lockup managers, consistent with a hypothesis of rent extraction in providing crisis era liquidity. The success of this opportunistic trading is concentrated during periods of high borrowing costs, in less liquid stock markets, and is enhanced by hedging in the equity option market.","['George O.

Drivers of effort: Evidence from employee absenteeism,"We use detailed information on individual absent spells of all employees in 4140 firms in Denmark to show large differences in average absenteeism across firms. Using employees who switch firms, we decompose days absent into an individual component (e.g., motivation, work ethic) and a firm component (e.g., incentives, corporate culture). We find the firm component explains 50%–60% of the difference in absenteeism across firms, with the individual component explaining the rest. We present suggestive evidence of the mechanisms behind the firm effect with family firm status and concentrated ownership strongly correlated with decreases in absenteeism. We also analyze the firm characteristics that correlate with the individual effect and find that firms with stronger career incentives attract lower-absenteeism employees.","['Morten Bennedsen', 'Margarita Tsoutsoura', 'Daniel Wolfenzon']","['Family firms', 'Organizational structure', 'Employee effort']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18303222,Journal of Financial Economics,2019,133,3

I find the answer hinges on its sectoral origin. Volatility that originates from the consumption (investment) sector drops (raises) macroeconomic growth rates and stock prices. Moreover, consumption (investment) sector’s technological volatility has a positive (negative) market price of risk. I show that a quantitative two-sector DSGE model that features monopolistic power for firms and sticky prices, as well as early resolution of uncertainty, can explain the differential impact of sectoral volatilities on real and financial variables.

Expectation and duration at the effective lower bound,"With risk-averse arbitrageurs and an effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal rates, nonlinear interactions among short-rate expectations, bond supply, and term premia emerge in equilibrium. These interactions, which are absent from affine models, help explain the observed behavior of the yield curve near the ELB, including evidence about unconventional monetary policy. The impact of both short-rate expectations and bond supply are attenuated at the ELB. However, in simulations of the post-crisis experience in the U.S., shocks to investors’ duration-risk exposures have much smaller effects than shocks to the anticipated path of short rates. The latter shocks matter, in part, because of the reduction in interest-rate volatility associated with a longer expected stay at the ELB—a novel channel of unconventional policy.",['Thomas B.
