Multivariate tests of the zero-beta CAPM,"A ‘cross-sectional regression test’ (CSRT) of the CAPM is developed and its connection to the Hotelling T2 test of multivariate statistical analysis is explored. Algebraic relations between the CSRT, the likehood ratio test and the Langrange multiplier test are derived and a useful small-sample bound on the distribution function of the CSRT is obtained. An application of the CSRT suggests that the CRSP equally-weighted index is inefficient, but that the inefficiency is not explained by a firm size-effect from February to December.",['Jay Shanken'],[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X85900029,Journal of Financial Economics,1985,14,3
Raiders or saviors? The evidence on six controversial investors,"Carl Icahn, Irwin Jacobs, Carl Lindner, David Murdock, Victor Posner, and the late Charles Bluhdorn are usually portrayed as corporate ‘raiders’. The evidence here, however, shows that between 1977 and 1982 when it was first announced that they had purchased stock in a given firm, stock prices on average increased significantly. The investors' activities in target firms for the two years following the initial stock purchase are likewise inconsistent with ‘raiding’. We discuss two hypotheses that are consistent with the evidence: first, these investors improve the management of target firms; second, they are systematically able to identify under-priced stocks.","['Clifford G.

The duration of option portfolios,"Duration is a value-weighted measure of average maturity which is commonly associated with portfolios of fixed-income securities. However, the concept finds application in option pricing theory also. This article shows that if options are valued by the Black (1976) formula and a comparative-statics methodology is employed, then the interest rate sensitivity of a portfolio of European options is equal to its duration. If the options are instead valued through the Black-Scholes (1973) formula, then the interest rate sensitivity is equal to only the ‘bond-equivalent duration’ inherent in a dynamic replication strategy for the option portfolio.",['Mark B.

Incentive effects of stock purchase plans,"Financial economists are interested in whether alternative compensation plans are adopted primarily for tax, incentive or signaling reasons. As most compensation plans have tax implications, examining for other effects is difficult. In this paper we examine the stock market reaction to employee stock purchase plans which are ‘non-tax advantageous’ and adopted for incentive/signaling reasons. The results suggest that (1) equity-based compensation schemes have a positive effect on shareholder wealth for reasons other than tax reduction, (2) a motive for adopting these plans is to align managerial and shareholder interests, and (3) equity ownership motivates key executives more than subordinate employees.","['Sanjai Bhagat', 'James A.

A Monte Carlo investigation of the accuracy of multivariate CAPM tests,"In a multivariate regression model relating individual returns to the market return, CAPM implies non-linear restrictions on the parameters. Several asymptotically valid tests of these restrictions have been suggested. The existing Monte Carlo evidence shows that some of these tests are unreliable for reasonable sample sizes, but does not indicate well which tests are reliable. This paper reports the results of an extensive Monte Carlo experiment. Shanken's CSR test and Jobson and Korkie's corrected likelihood ratio test are quite accurate in all cases we consider.","['Christine E.

Underpricing of seasoned issues,In this paper we provide a model of the underwritten offerings of new shares of seasoned securities. Our purpose is to explain why the offering price chosen by the underwriter is lower than the market price of the firm's shares. Our model recognizes the interdependence between the markets surrounding the announcement and sale of the new issue and recognizes as well the effect which asymmetric information regarding investor demands has upon the prices in these markets.,"['John E.

Managerial ownership of voting rights,"Managers of firms with dual classes of common stock can choose different quantities of votes for a given cash flow interest by choosing different quantities of the two securities. We study managerial stock holdings in 45 dual class firms and find that vote ownership per se is an important motivation for these holdings in that corporate officers and their families hold a median 56.9% of the votes and 24.0% of the common stock cash flows. We also find significant family involvement in many sample firms, and document four case studies in which explicit acquisition premiums were paid for superior voting shares.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X85900431,Journal of Financial Economics,1985,14,1
Direct evidence on the marginal rate of taxation on dividend income,"Miller and Scholes (1978) hypothesize that the marginal tax rate on dividend income may be less than the marginal rate of tax on capital gains. Their hypothesis is dependent upon individuals utilizing existing provisions of the Code which serve to reduce the taxation of dividends. In this study, estimates of the marginal and effective rates of tax on dividend income for the year 1979 are presented using the Statistics of Income sample of returns. The average marginal rate of tax on dividend income is estimated to be 40%, while the average effective rate of tax is estimated to be 30%.","['Pamela P. Peterson', 'David R. Peterson', 'James S.

Trading and valuing depreciable assets,"Optimal policies for selling a risky depreciable asset with proportional taxes and transaction costs are derived for a representative investor who maximizes the market value of his investment. Also calculated are the market value of his investment and the competitive price of the depreciable asset. Depending upon the values of various parameters, the investor realizes either capital gains and no losses, capital losses and no gains, or neither gains nor losses. Additional properties of the solution are derived numerically.",['Joseph T.

Time preference and capital asset pricing models,"Results of the theory of individual optimal consumption-investment choice under uncertainty are extended to a class of intertemporally dependent preferences for consumption streams. These results are then used to show that with intertemporally dependent preferences, which are more realistic than the separable time-additive preference structure, Merton's (1973) multi-beta intertemporal capital asset pricing model is still valid, but it can no longer be collapsed to Breeden's (1979) single consumption-beta model.",['Yaacov Z.

The effect of value line investment survey rank changes on common stock prices,"The information content of Value Line Investment Survey rank changes is investigated. The results suggest rank changes affect common stock prices, but the effect varies by the type of rank change. Changes from rank 2 to rank 1 have the most dramatic impact on prices. A cross-sectional analysis finds small firms have a greater reaction to a rank change than larger firms, which supports theories on the frequency of report arrival and precision of information. A speed of adjustment test concludes the prices of individual securities adjust to the information in a rank change over a multiple-day period.",['Scott E.

"Bid, ask and transaction prices in a specialist market with heterogeneously informed traders","The presence of traders with superior information leads to a positive bid-ask spread even when the specialist is risk-neutral and makes zero expected profits. The resulting transaction prices convey information, and the expectation of the average spread squared times volume is bounded by a number that is independent of insider activity. The serial correlation of transaction price differences is a function of the proportion of the spread due to adverse selection. A bid-ask spread implies a divergence between observed returns and realizable returns. Observed returns are approximately realizable returns plus what the uninformed anticipate losing to the insiders.","['Lawrence R. Glosten', 'Paul R.

Organizational forms and investment decisions,"This paper analyzes investment rules for various organizational forms that are distinguished by the characteristics of their residual claims. Different restrictions on residual claims lead to different decision rules. The analysis indicates that the investment decisions of open corporations, financial mutuals and non-profits can be modeled by the value maximization rule. However, the decisions of proprietorships, partnerships, and closed corporations cannot in general be modeled by the market value rule.","['Eugene F. Fama', 'Michael C.

Volatility increases subsequent to stock splits: An empirical aberration,"This paper analyzes the empirical behavior of stock-return volatilities prior to and subsequent to the ex-dates of stock splits. The evidence demonstrates rather unambiguously that there is, on the average, an approximately 30% ‘arbitrary’ increase in the return standard deviations following the ex-date. The increase holds for both daily and weekly data, and it is not temporary. No explanatory confounding variables, such as institutional frictions affecting price observations, have been identified. We view the findings as being essentially inconsistent with the notion of ‘rational pricing’.","['James A. Ohlson', 'Stephen H.

An analysis of secured debt,"This paper analyzes the pricing of two types of secured debt and shows that secured debt can be used to increase the value of the firm. In particular, it is shown that some profitable projects will not be undertaken by a firm which can use only equity or unsecured debt to finance them but will be undertaken if they can be financed with secured debt. Secured debt is priced for a firm with two assets and some unsecured debt outstanding. The pricing results are used to illustrate the benefits of the security provision of secured debt.","['RenéM.

Using daily stock returns,"This paper examines properties of daily stock returns and how the particular characteristics of these data affect event study methodologies. Daily data generally present few difficulties for event studies. Standard procedures are typically well-specified even when special daily data characteristics are ignored. However, recognition of autocorrelation in daily excess returns and changes in their variance conditional on an event can sometimes be advantageous. In addition, tests ignoring cross-sectional dependence can be well-specified and have higher power than tests which account for potential dependence.","['Stephen J. Brown', 'Jerold B.

Predictable events and excess returns: The case of dividend announcements,"This paper hypothesizes that the risk per unit of time and the required rate of return are higher than normal during an event period whose timing can be predicted. Consistent with this hypothesis this paper presents empirical evidence indicating that the unconditional mean rate of return, the variance of stock returns and their systematic risk are higher than ‘usual’ during dividend announcement periods. However, the documented increases in the systematic risk are not large enough to fully explain the ‘excess returns’. This finding is puzzling and hard to reconcile with existing theory.","['Avner Kalay', 'Uri Loewenstein']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X85900078,Journal of Financial Economics,1985,14,3
Corporate capital expenditure decisions and the market value of the firm,"This paper is an ‘event-time’ study of the common stock prices of a sample of 658 corporations around the dates on which they publicly announced their future capital expenditure plans. For industrial firms, announcements of increases (decreases) in planned capital expenditures are associated with significant positive (negative) excess stock returns. For public utility firm, neither increases nor decreases in planned capital expenditures are associated with significant excess stock returns. We interpret the evidence as being consistent with the hypothesis that managers seek to maximize the market value of the firm in making their corporate capital expenditure decisions.","['John J.

An empirical analysis of the interfirm equity investment process,"This paper measures the effects on stock proces of corporate investments in 5% or more of another company's equity securities. Such investments initiate a process that may end with a takeover, targeted repurchase, takeover by a third party, or sale of the shares. The total valuation effect of the investment for acquiring and target firms includes returns at disclosure of the investment position, the outcome announcement, and related intervening events. For example, the positive return for target firms at initial disclosure of the investment more than offsets the negative return at a targeted repurchase.","['Wayne H. Mikkelson', 'Richard S.

Partially anticipated events: A model of stock price reactions with an application to corporate acquisitions,"This paper presents a model of stock price reactions to partially anticipated events. The model formalizes the intuition that stock price reactions reflect both the economic importance of events and the extent to which events are surprises. Unbiased estimates of the economic importance of partially anticipated events must combine stock price reactions to events with stock price movements in periods when no event occurs. The model is used to estimate the value of acquisition attempts made by frequently acquiring firms. For a sample of thirty active acquirers, the evidence indicates that acquisition attempts were profitable investment projects.","['Paul H.

Stock price effects and costs of secondary distributions,"This study does not support the view that a large number of shares can be sold at the prevailing market price and at a small cost. A significant stock price decrease is observed at the initial announcement of secondary distributions. The price declines are greater for offerings by officers and directors and for larger offerings, but are significant for all types of sellers and for large and small offerings. There is no significant price decline at the offering when secondaries are announced in advance. Underwriting and other selling costs are substantial and are positively related to relative offering size.","['Wayne H.

Dividend yields and stock returns: Implications of abnormal January returns,"This study examines the empirical relation between stock returns and (long-run) dividend yields. The findings show that much of the phenomenon is due to a nonlinear relation between dividend yields and returns in January. Regression coefficients on dividend yields, which some models predict should be non-zero due to differential taxation of dividends and capital gains, exhibit a significant January seasonal, even when controlling for size. This finding is significant since there are no provisions in the after-tax asset pricing models that predict the tax differential is more important in January than in other months.",['Donald B.

Derived factors in event studies,"We examine the utility of the statistical factor model of the process generating stock returns in the context of event studies. For a variety of estimation procedures and experimental designs we find limited value added relative to the use of a simple market model. We would attribute this finding to misspecification of the statistical factor analysis model, and suspect that there exist more robust procedures for estimating the factor structure of stock returns.","['Stephen J.

Market rationality and dividend announcements,"We investigate stock market rationality by examining the timeliness and unbiasedness of the market's response to dividend announcements. Our initial findings for market timeliness show a sluggish market reaction to dividend announcements; however, when the ex-dividend effect is controlled for, we find no evidence of a sluggish market reaction. We examine the unbiasedness of the market's response by testing whether the net announcement effect across a sample that is devoid of ex-post selection bias sums to zero. We observe a significant positive net announcement effect and examine several plausible conjectures for this puzzling phenomenon, but none provides a satisfactory explanation.","['Kenneth M.

An exploratory investigation of the firm size effect,"We investigate the firm size effect for the period 1958 to 1977 in the framework of a multi-factor pricing model. The risk-adjusted difference in returns between the top five percent and the bottom five percent of the NYSE firms is about one to two percent a year, a drop from about twelve percent per year before risk adjustment. The variable most responsible for the adjustment is the sensitivity of asset returns to the changing risk premium, measured by the return difference between low-grade bonds and long-term government bonds.","['K.C.

Testing asset pricing models with changing expectations and an unobservable market portfolio,"When the assumption of constant risk premiums is relaxed, financial valuation models may be tested, and risk measures estimated without specifying a market index or state variables. This is accomplished by examining the behavior of conditional expected returns. The approach is developed using a single risk premium asset pricing model as an example and then extended to models with multiple risk premiums. The methodology is illustrated using daily return data on the common stocks of the Dow Jones 30. The tests indicate that these returns are consistent with a single, time-varying risk premium.","['Michael R.
