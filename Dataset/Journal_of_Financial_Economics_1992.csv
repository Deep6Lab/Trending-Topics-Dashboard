Measuring abnormal performance,"A highly controversial issue in financial economies is whether stocks overreact. In this paper we find an economically-important overreaction effect even after adjusting for size and beta. In portfolios formed on the basis of prior five-year returns, extreme prior losers outperform extreme prior winners by 5–10% per year during the subsequent five years. Although we find a pronounced January seasonal, our evidence suggests that the overreaction effect is distinct from tax-loss selling effects. Interestingly, the overreaction effect is substantially stronger for smaller firms than for larger firms. Returns consistent with the overeaction hypothesis are also observed for short windows around quarterly earnings announcements.","['Navin Chopra', 'Josef Lakonishok', 'Jay R.

Underwriting calls of convertible securities,Average common stock price responses to convertible preferred stock calls are significantly negative only when firms employ underwriters to assure conversion. Previous work reports similar results for convertible bond calls; we find that the stock price reaction does not depend upon the type of convertible security being called. The results support the idea that managers are more likely to have calls underwritten the more unfavorable their private information about firm value.,"['Arnold R. Cowan', 'Nandkumar Nayar', 'Ajai K.

Do outside directors monitor managers?,"Examining 128 tender offer bids made from 1980 through 1987, we categorize outside directors as either independent of or having some affiliation with managers, and find that bidding firms on which independent outside directors hold at least 50% of the seats have significantly higher announcement-date abnormal returns than other bidders. However, the relationship between bidding firms' abnormal stock returns and the proportion of board seats held by independent outside directors is nonlinear, suggesting it is possible to have too many independent outside directors. All results are lost if the traditional inside-outside board classification method is used.","['John W. Byrd', 'Kent A.

What's special about the specialist?,"Exchange members claim that the professional relationships that evolve on exchange floors yield benefits not easily duplicated by an anonymous exchange mechanism. We show that longstanding relationships between brokers and specialists can mitigate the effects of asymmetric information. Moreover, a specialist who actively attempts to differentiate between informed and uninformed traders can achieve equilibria that Pareto-dominate an equilibrium in which the two types of trades are pooled. Our model also elucidates the role of block trading houses in mitigating information problems in the block market.","['Lawrence M. Benveniste', 'Alan J. Marcus', 'William J.

"Contract costs, bank loans, and the cross-monitoring hypothesis",I examine whether monitoring-related contract costs are reflected in bank loan spreads and find evidence that cross-monitoring by senior and subordinate claimholders is associated with smaller spreads. I also find that loan spreads reflect financial contract costs of controlling borrower behavior toward the assets being financed. These results support the importance of contract costs in firms' financing decisions and provide evidence of the importance of monitoring in bank lending arrangements.,['James R.

Initial public offerings of equity securities,"In contrast with numerous studies that find significant underpricing for initial public offerings of industrial firms, we document a statistically significant average return of −2.82% on the first trading day for a sample of 87 initial public offerings of real estate investment trusts during the 1971–1988 period. Our overpricing result is invariant to offer price, issue size, distribution method, offer period, and underwriter reputation. Newly issued REITs, on average, substantially underperform a matching sample of seasoned REITs during the first 190 trading days. Interestingly, buyers of overpriced REITs are predominantly individual or non-13(f) institutional investors.","['Ko Wang', 'Su Han Chan', 'George W.

No news is good news,"It seems plausible that an increase in stock market volatility raises required stock returns, and thus lowers stock prices. We develop a formal model of this volatility feedback effect using a simple model of changing variance (a quadratic generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic, or QGARCH, model). Our model is asymmetric and helps to explain the negative skewness and excess kurtosis of U.S. monthly and daily stock returns over the period 1926–1988. We find that volatility feedback normally has little effect on returns, but it can be important during periods of high volatility.","['John Y.

Corrections and additions to ‘a nonlinear equilibrium model of the term structure of interest rates’,"Longstaff (1989) introduces a new process for the short rate of interest. He claims to derive the zero-coupon bond pricing formula and state transition density for his model. We demonstrate that Longstaff's pricing formula is not the solution to the pricing problem which he poses. The source of his error is a failure to properly account for a boundary condition. We introduce a new model economy and derive a new endogenous interest rate process, and find the Green's function and the price of a zero-coupon bond for our model economy.","['David Beaglehole', 'Mark Tenney']",[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9290032S,Journal of Financial Economics,1992,32,3
Market volatility prediction and the efficiency of the S & P 100 index option market,"Most models of market volatility use either past returns or ex post volatility to forecast volatility. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of market volatility is assessed by forecasting the volatility implied in the transaction prices of Standard & Poor's 100 index options. We test and reject the hypothesis that volatility changes are unpredictable. However, while our statistical model delivers precise forecasts, abnormal returns are not possible in a trading strategy (based on daily out-of-sample volatility projections) which takes transaction costs into account, suggesting that predictable time-varying volatility is consistent with market efficiency.","['Campbell R.

Does the form of compensation matter?,"The role of fee contracts in the agency relation between investment bankers and client firms in tender offers is investigated using a sample of offers between 1978 and 1986. Different fees have different payoff functions which can be used by firms to create incentives and by bankers to signal differences in abilities. The effectiveness of fee contracts in resolving agency problems in tested, with mixed results. The evidence suggests that fee contracts are used as a tool by both firms and bankers and that contracts influence tender offer outcomes but that contracting is only a partial solution to the agency problem.",['Robyn M.

Global financial markets and the risk premium on U.S. equity,"There is a significant foreign influence on the risk premium for U.S. assets. Using a bivariate GARCH-in-mean process, we find that the conditional expected excess return on U.S. stocks is positively related to the conditional covariance of the return of these stocks with the return on a foreign index but is not related to its own conditional variance. Further, we are unable to reject the international version of the CAPM. We present evidence for different model specifications, multiple-day returns, and alternative proxies for foreign stock returns.","['K.C. Chan', 'G.Andrew Karolyi', 'RenéM.

Convertible bonds as backdoor equity financing,"This paper argues that corporations may use convertible bonds as an indirect way to get equity into their capital structures when adverse-selection problems make a conventional stock issue unattractive. Unlike other theories of convertible bond issuance, the model here highlights: 1) the importance of call provisions on convertibles and 2) the significance of costs of financial distress to the information content of a convertible issue.",['Jeremy C.

Stock return variation and expected dividends,"This paper examines the extent to which aggregate stock return variation is explained by variables chosen to reflect revisions in expectations of future dividends. In effect, we decompose realized dividend growth into expected and unexpected components using information in aggregate investment, dividend yield, and future returns. A parsimonious specification accounts for over 70% of annual return variation. We also conduct a cross-sectional experiment using portfolios formed on the basis of annual return performance. This analysis shows that nearly 90% of the portfolio return variation is explained by dividend and expected return variables.","['S.P.

Changes in corporate performance associated with bank acquisitions,"This paper examines the post-acquisition performance of large bank mergers between 1982 and 1987. On the whole, the merged banks outperform the banking industry. Their better performance appears to result from improvements in the ability to attract loans and deposits, in employee productivity, and in profitable asset growth. Further, we find a significant correlation between announcement-period abnormal stock returns and the various performance measures, showing that market participants are able to identify in advance the improved performance associated with bank acquisitions.","['Marcia Millon Cornett', 'Hassan Tehranian']",[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9290004H,Journal of Financial Economics,1992,31,2
Contagion and competitive intra-industry effects of bankruptcy announcements,"This paper investigates the effect of bankruptcy announcements on the equity value of the bankrupt firm's competitors. On average, bankruptcy announcements decrease the value of a value-weighted portfolio of competitors by 1%. This negative effect is significantly larger for highly levered industries and industries where the unconditional stock returns of the nonbankrupt and bankrupt firms are highly correlated; the effect is significantly positive for highly concentrated industries with low leverage, suggesting that in such industries competitors benefit from the difficulties of the bankrupt firm.","['Larry H.P.

The monotonicity of the term premium,"This paper reexamines existing evidence regarding the monotonicity of the term premium. Using a recently developed approach for testing inequality constraints, we propose and conduct tests for whether the term premium is monotonic and reach different conclusions from those implied by individual t-statistics on term premiums (even under a Bonferroni-type adjustment). Our results generally support McCulloch's (1987) view that the liquidity preference hypothesis remains unrefuted.","['Matthew Richardson', 'Paul Richardson', 'Tom Smith']",[],[],1992,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9290013N,Journal of Financial Economics,1992,31,1
The impact of institutional trading on stock prices,"This paper uses new data on the holdings of 769 tax-exempt (predominantly pension) funds, to evaluate the potential effect of their trading on stock prices. We address two aspects of trading by these money managers: herding, which refers to buying (selling) simultaneously the same stocks as other managers buy (sell), and positive-feedback trading, which refers to buying past winners and selling past losers. These two aspects of trading are commonly a part of the argument that institutions destabilize stock prices. The evidence suggests that pension managers do not strongly pursue these potentially destabilizing practices.","['Josef Lakonishok', 'Andrei Shleifer', 'Robert W.

State intervention in the market for corporate control,"This study investigates the impact of Pennsylvania Senate Bill 1310 on the share prices of Pennsylvania corporations. Considered the most severe of the second-generation antitakeover laws, the statute limits the ability of shareholders to challenge management through the proxy process and eliminates the traditional fiduciary obligation of directors to promote shareholders' interests. We find that PA SB1310 significantly decreased share values, and estimate the loss to shareholders of Pennsylvania firms at $4 billion. However, firms with antitakeover charter amendments already in place were less affected, and firms that exempted themselves from PA SB1310 recovered a portion of shareholders' wealth.","['Samuel H.

"Regulation, competition, and abnormal returns in the market for failed thrifts","This study investigates the returns to acquiring-firm stockholders in federally assisted mergers in the savings and loan industry. It is unique in that (a) these mergers are arranged and subsidized by government regulators and (b) they occur in a single industry, one plagued by well-publicized financial difficulties. The contribution of resources by the federal government creates the possibility of wealth transfers from the government to owners of the acquiring firms. We find, consistent with the oversubsidization hypothesis, that shareholders of acquiring firms earn significant positive returns.","['Sheldon D. Baibirer', 'G.Donald Jud', 'Frederick W.

Adverse selection and the rights offer paradox,"We develop an analytical framework to explain firm's choice of equity flotation method and the near disappearance of rights offers by U.S. exchange-listed firms. The choice between uninsured rights, rights with standby underwriting, and firm-commitment underwriting depends on information asymmetries, shareholder characteristics, and direct flotation costs. Underwriter certification and current-shareholder takeup are viewed as substitute mechanisms for minimizing wealth transfers between shareholders and outside investors. Uninsured rights create adverse-selection effects when shareholder takeup is low. Implications for stock-price behavior around issue announcements, shareholder subscription precommitments, and relative issue frequencies are supported by large-sample evidence.","['B.Espen Eckbo', 'Ronald W.

Time-varying risk premia and forecastable returns in futures markets,"We document that instrumental variables known to possess forecast power in equity and bond markets (Treasury bill yields, equity dividend yields, and the ‘junk’ bond premium) also possess forecast power for prices in agricultural, metals, and currency futures markets. The pattern of forecastability in futures is consistent with economic equilibrium as embodied by a two-‘latent-variable’ model. We test whether the latent variables that explain these futures returns coincide with latent variables that explain returns on size-ranked equity portfolios. This hypothesis is rejected, suggesting that futures are subject to different sources of priced risk than are equities.","['Hendrik Bessembinder', 'Kalok Chan']",[],[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9290017R,Journal of Financial Economics,1992,32,2
An ordered probit analysis of transaction stock prices,"We estimate the conditional distribution of trade-to-trade price changes using ordered probit, a statistical model for discrete random variables. This approach recognizes that transaction price changes occur in discrete increments, typically eighths of a dollar, and occur at irregularly-spaced time intervals. Unlike existing models of discrete transactions prices, ordered probit can quantify the effects of other economic variables like volume, past price changes, and the time between trades on price changes. Using 1988 transactions data for over 100 randomly chosen U.S. stocks, we estimate the ordered probit model via maximum likelihood and use the parameter estimates to measure several transaction-related quantities, such as the price impact of trades of a given size, the tendency towards price reversals from one transaction to the next, and the empirical significance of price discreteness.","['Jerry A.

Managerial vote ownership and shareholder wealth,"We examine employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) announcements to study the effects of an increase in managerial voting rights without a proportional increase in the ownership of cash flow claims. Our finding that when managers initially control few votes firm value increases with the fraction of shares contributed to the ESOP supports the view that managerial vote control serves shareholder interests. Conversely, the decrease in firm value with larger contributions to the ESOP when managers initially control many votes reflects a divergence of incentives that increases the agency problems between managers and outside shareholders.","['Saeyoung Chang', 'David Mayers']",[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9290027U,Journal of Financial Economics,1992,32,1
"The investment opportunity set and corporate financing, dividend, and compensation policies","We examine explanations for corporate financing-, dividend-, and compensation-policy choices.

Does corporate performance improve after mergers?,"We examine post-acquisition performance for the 50 largest U.S. mergers between 1979 and mid-1984. Merged firms show significant improvements in asset productivity relative to their industries, leading to higher operating cash flow returns. This performance improvement is particularly strong for firms with highly overlapping businesses. Mergers do not lead to cuts in long-term capital and R&D investments. There is a strong positive relation between postmerger increases in operating cash flows and abnormal stock returns at merger announcements, indicating that expectations of economic improvements underlie the equity revaluations of the merging firms.","['Paul M.

Informational externalities of seasoned equity issues,"We examine share-price reactions of commercial bank common stock issues and find negative effects on rival commercial and investment banking firms. In comparison, we find no such intra-industry effects for equity issues by industrial firms. Our results support theoretical models in which bank loan portfolios impound asymmetric information about client firms, so that adverse individual bank announcements generate external information effects on other banks. A policy implication of these results is that regulatory pressures applied to individual banks induce spillover costs for the commercial and investment banking industries. Our evidence also indicates that the legal separation of commercial and investment banking activities is artificial.","['Myron B. Slovin', 'Marie E. Sushka', 'John A.

The relation between the Value Line enigma and post-earnings-announcement drift,"We investigate the relation between the Value Line enigma and post-earnings-announcement drift. The ability of Value Line's ‘timeliness’ ranks to predict future abnormal returns is well-documented. However, we show that most rank changes occur within eight trading days of an earnings announcement. Once we control for post-earnings-announcement drift, differences in abnormal returns across Value Line timeliness ranks are no longer significant. Moreover, we find that timeliness ranks have no predictive power for firms with small earnings ‘surprises’. We conclude that the Value Line enigma is a manifestation of post-earnings-announcement drift.","['John Affleck-Graves', 'Richard R.

Multiple equilibria and term structure models,"We show the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross term structure framework can allow a variety of alternative equilibrium solutions for discount bond prices. This is important since it allows us additional flexibility in developing models that capture the properties of the term structure. As an example, we solve for the value of a discount bond when the short-term rate is absorbed at zero. We compare the yields implied by this model to those implied by the original Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model. We also show that alternative equilibria can occur in other term structure models.",['Francis A.

Research design issues in grouping-based tests,"With grouping, a sample is sorted by an observable variable and the mean values of the dependent variable in the extreme-ranked groups are compared. We show that test power is maximized when the two extreme groups each contain 27% of the sample, a much larger percentage than that typically used in the literature. This result is not sensitive to the distribution of the dependent variable. We also show that regression is unambiguously more powerful than grouping, even when the independent variable is measured with error.","['Thomas Lys', 'Jowell S.
