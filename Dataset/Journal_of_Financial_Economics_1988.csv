Short-term trading around ex-dividend days,"A dividend tax penalty creates profitable trading opportunities for short-term traders with sufficiently low transaction costs. In stocks with ex-dividend day returns affected by short-term trading, ex-day returns are positively correlated with transaction costs. Data from 1964–1985 indicate that short-term traders are the marginal investors in high-yield stocks, primarily since the introduction of negotiated commissions on the NYSE. Short-term trading is not evident in low-yield stocks, nor does it appear prevalent before negotiated commissions.","['Jonathan M. Karpoff', 'Ralph A.

Earnings information conveyed by dividend initiations and omissions,"Firms that initiate dividend payments have positive earnings changes both before and after the dividend policy change, while those omitting dividend payments have negative earnings changes. Subsequent earnings changes are positively related to the dividend announcement return, and stock price reactions at subsequent earnings announcements are smaller than usual, suggesting that these earnings changes are partially anticipated at the dividend announcement. The results indicate that investors interpret announcements of dividend initiations and omissions as managers' forecasts of future earnings changes.","['Paul M. Healy', 'Krishna G.

The effect of issuing preferred stock on common and preferred stockholder wealth,"Generally, utilities issue straight fixed-rate preferreds, industrials issue convertible fixed-rate preferreds, and financials issue adjustable-rate preferreds. The corresponding announcement-period common stock abnormal returns are economically insignificant for utilities, negative and significant at the 0.05 level for industrials, and positive and significant at the 0.10 level for financials. Information effects explain the cross-sectional results for industrial firms, but tax benefits and/or regulatory conditions are more likely explanations of the results documented for financial corporations and utilities. Returns to preferred stockholders support neither the wealth redistribution- hypothesis nor the price-pressure hypothesis.","['Scott C. Linn', 'J.

The Eurobond market and corporate financial policy,"On average, significant positive abnormal returns are associated with Eurobond issues during the period 1975–1985. The cross-sectional and time-series distributions of the abnormal returns are consistent with the hypothesis that impediments to the adjustment of asset supplies to new demand conditions are large enough to create profitable financing opportunities for firms. Our analysis demonstrates how profitable financing opportunities can persist on the Eurobond market and when they are most likely to arise.","['Yong Cheol Kim', 'RenéM.

The real term structure and consumption growth,"One version of the consumption-based asset pricing model implies a linear relation between expected returns and expected consumption growth. This paper provides evidence that the expected real term structure contains information that can be used to forecast consumption growth. The evidence is strongest for the 1970s and 1980s. The real term structure contains more information than two alternative measures: lagged consumption growth and lagged stock returns. Further, the real term structure appears to have slightly more forecasting power than the leading commercial econemetric models.",['Campbell R.

The information in forward rates,"Term-structure models from Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) imply that conditional expected discrete-period returns on discount instruments are linear functions of forward rates. Tests reject a single-latent-variable model of expected returns on U.S. Treasury bills, but two or three latent variables appear to describe expected returns on bills of all maturities. Expected returns estimated using two-latent-variables exhibit variation with business cycles similar to what Fama (1986) observes for forward rates. Inverted term structures precede recessions and upward-sloping structures precede recoveries.",['Robert F.

Dividend yields and expected stock returns,"The power of dividend yields to forecast stock returns, measured by regression R2, increases with the return horizon. We offer a two-part explanation. (1) High autocorrelation causes the variance of expected returns to grow faster than the return horizon. (2) The growth of the variance of unexpected returns with the return horizon is attenuated by a discount-rate effect - shocks to expected returns generate opposite shocks to current prices. We estimate that, on average, the future price increases implied by higher expected returns are just offset by the decline in the current price. Thus, time-varying expected returns generate ‘temporary’ components of prices.","['Eugene F. Fama', 'Kenneth R.

Corporate payout policy,"Theories of corporate payout policy do not explain the observed form of distributions to shareholders. Although open-market repurchases appear to have tax advantages, cash dividends are overwhelmingly chosen. We argue that there are costs associated with open-market-repurchase programs, since they provide managers with opportunities to use inside information to benefit themselves at stockholders' expense. We offer evidence suggesting that bid-ask spreads widen around repurchase announcements, as predicted by our analysis. Since these costs of repurchases do not arise with cash dividends, our analysis implies that repurchases do not dominate cash dividends for making distributions to shareholders.","['Michael J.

"Trades, quotes, inventories, and information","This empirical examination of the relation between trades and quote revisions for New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks is designed to ascertain asymmetric-information and inventory-control effects. This study finds that negative autocorrelation in trades consistent with inventory-control behavior characterizes low-volume stocks, but not high-volume stocks. The evidence of inventory control in the impact of trades on quote revisions is inconclusive. The information content of trades, on the other hand, is found to be substantial. There is also strong evidence that large trades convey more information than small trades.",['Joel Hasbrouck'],[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X88900700,Journal of Financial Economics,1988,22,2
Estimating the components of the bid/ask spread,"This paper develops and implements a technique for estimating a model of the bid/ask spread. The spread is decomposed into two components, one due to asymmetric information and one due to inventory costs, specialist monopoly power, and clearing costs. The model is estimated using NYSE common stock transaction prices in the period 1981–1983. Cross-sectional regression analysis is then used to relate time-series estimated spread components to other stock characteristics. The results cannot reject the hypothesis that significant amounts of NYSE common stock spreads are due to asymmetric information.","['Lawrence R Glosten', 'Lawrence E Harris']",[],[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X88900347,Journal of Financial Economics,1988,21,1
"Risk aversion, uncertain information, and market efficiency","This paper develops and tests the uncertain information hypothesis as a means of explaining the response of rational, risk-averse investors to the arrival of unanticipated information. The theory predicts that following news of a dramatic financial event, both the risk and expected return of the affected companies increase systematically, and that prices react more strongly to bad news than good. An empirical investigation of over 9000 marketwide and firm-specific events produces results consistent with these predictions. We conclude that the market reacts to uncertain information in an efficient, if not instantaneous, manner.","['Keith C. Brown', 'W.V. Harlow', 'Seha M.

Synergistic gains from corporate acquisitions and their division between the stockholders of target and acquiring firms,"This paper documents that a successful tender offer increases the combined value of the target and acquiring firms by an average of 7.4%. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the process of competition for control of the target and empirical evidence that competition among bidding firms increases the returns to targets and decreases the returns to acquirers, that the supply of target shares is positively sloped, and that changes in the legal/institutional environment of tender offers have had no impact on the total (percentage) synergistic gains created but have significantly affected their division between the stockholders of the target and acquiring firms.","['Michael Bradley', 'Anand Desai', 'E.Han Kim']",[],[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8890030X,Journal of Financial Economics,1988,21,1
Announcement effects of new equity issues and the use of intraday price data,"This paper examines the intraday market response to announcements of new equity issues. For fifteen minutes following the announcement, there is abnormally high volume and a -1.3% average return. There is also a small, but significant, negative average return in the hour before the announcement. Issue size, intended use of proceeds, and estimated profitability of new investment are uncorrelated with the announcement effect. After the issuance of new shares, there is a significant price recovery of 1.5%. This evidence is inconsistent with many theoretical rationales for the negative market reaction to new equity issue announcements.","['Michael J Barclay', 'Robert H Litzenberger']",[],[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X88900323,Journal of Financial Economics,1988,21,1
Investigating security-price performance in the presence of event-date uncertainty,"This paper introduces an event-study method that incorporates the possibility of a random event date. Consistent with empirical evidence, we assume an event may affect not only the conditional mean of a security's return, but also its conditional variance. We compare the statistical power and efficiency of our maximum-likelihood method with the standard application of traditional event-study methods to multiday security returns. Assuming a two-day event period, our empirical results provide evidence that the multiday approach is robust. We use our maximum-likelihood method to investigate the valuation effects of stock splits and stock dividends.","['Clifford A. Ball', 'Walter N.

Mean reversion in stock prices,"This paper investigates transitory components in stock prices. After showing that statistical tests have little power to detect persistent deviations between market prices and fundamental values, we consider whether prices are mean-reverting, using data from the United States and 17 other countries. Our point estimates imply positive autocorrelation in returns over short horizons and negative autocorrelation over longer horizons, although random-walk price behavior cannot be rejected at conventional statistical levels. Substantial movements in required returns are needed to account for these correlation patterns. Persistent, but transitory, disparities between prices and fundamental values could also explain our findings.","['James M. Poterba', 'Lawrence H.

Some tests of international equity integration,"This paper provides tests of international equity market integration. The tests use a simple version of the consumption-based asset pricing model which predicts there is an asset pricing line for each country that relates a representative individual's expected real return on each asset to the covariance of this return with growth in the individual's real consumption. Using monthly data from January 1960 to December 1985, tests provide little evidence against the joint hypothesis that equity markets are integrated internationally and that the asset pricing model holds.",['Simon Wheatley'],[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X88900608,Journal of Financial Economics,1988,21,2
Time-varying betas and risk premia in the pricing of forward foreign exchange contracts,"This paper specifies the single-beta capital asset pricing model for the pricing of forward foreign exchange contracts from the point of view of a U.S. investor. Parametric specification of the betas as ARCH-like processes explicitly allows for time variation as well as sign variation of the risk premium in the forward foreign exchange market. I estimate the model jointly for four currencies, using a generalized method of moments procedure. The results show significant time variation for the betas and tests of the overidentifying restrictions are generally favorable to the model.",['Nelson C.

The information effects of takeover bids and resistance,"This paper tests whether takeover bids and takeover resistance by target management convey information to the market about the stand-alone value of target firms. When initial bids are made, analysts' consensus forecasts of stand-alone earnings do not change significantly for any group of takeover targets. This is consistent with the synergy view of mergers and inconsistent with the undervaluation theory. Consensus forecasts fall significantly when managers resist takeover. The decline is about 10% of the level of previously forecast earnings and is approximately equal whether the target is ultimately acquired or remains independent.",['John Pound'],[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X88900694,Journal of Financial Economics,1988,22,2
The empirical foundations of the arbitrage pricing theory,"This paper uses maximum-likelihood factor analysis of large cross-sections to examine the validity of the arbitrage pricing theory (APT). We are unable to explain the expected returns on firm size portfolios, although we do explain the expected returns on portfolios formed on the basis of dividend yield and own variance, where risk adjustment using the usual CAPM market proxies fails. We also compare alternate versions of the APT and sharply reject the hypothesis that basis portfolios formed to mimic the factors span the mean-variance frontier of the individual assets.","['Bruce N.

Equilibrium pricing and portfolio composition in the presence of uncertain parameters,"We analyze the effect of parameter uncertainty on equilibrium asset prices. For the symmetric case, when the amount of estimation risk is the same for all securities, the existing literature argues that parameter uncertainty is largely irrelevant for equilibrium. Our results differ. We find that symmetric estimation risk affects equilibrium values of relative asset prices, expected returns, market weights, and betas.","['Jeffrey L.

"Stock splits, stock prices, and transaction costs",We develop a model of stock-split behavior in which the split serves as a costly signal of managers' private information because stock trading costs depend on stock prices. We present empirical evidence confirming the relation between stock trading costs and stock prices. The signaling model is estimated using a large sample of splits and explains a substantial fraction of the split-announcement returns.,"['Michael J. Brennan', 'Thomas E.

Seasonalities in security returns,We document a seasonal pattern in stock returns around quarterly earnings announcement dates: small firms show large positive abnormal returns and a sizable increase in the variability of returns around these dates. Only part of the large abnormal returns can be accounted for by the tendency of firms with good news to announce early. Large firms show no abnormal returns around announcement dates and a much smaller increase in variability.,"['V.V Chari', 'Ravi Jagannathan', 'Aharon R Ofer']",[],[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X88900335,Journal of Financial Economics,1988,21,1
The behavior of the volatility implicit in the prices of stock index options,"We examine stock-market volatility around the quarterly expirations of stock index futures contracts and nonquarterly expirations of stock index options, using estimates of the volatility implicit in the option prices. The option prices reflect increases in the volatility of the underlying stock indexes around both quarterly and nonquarterly expiration dates. Analysis of the residual returns on index options provides evidence consistent with an unexpected increase in market volatility around expiration dates.","['Theodore E. Day', 'Craig M.

An investigation of cost differences between public sales and private placements of debt,"We examine the cost differences between public sales and private placements of debt for a sample of public utility issues. The lowest cost method depends on a firm's transaction costs which comprise flotation costs, agency costs, and the costs of searching the market. Our findings suggest that firms minimize the cost of issuing securities by selecting the market providing the lowest transaction costs.","['David W. Blackwell', 'David S.

Risk and return in an equilibrium APT,"We use an asymptotic principal components technique to estimate the pervasive factors influencing asset returns and to test the restrictions imposed by static and intertemporal equilibrium versions of the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) on a multivariate regression model. The empirical techniques allow for fairly arbitrary time variation in risk premiums. We find that the APT provides a better description of the expected returns on assets than the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). However, some statistically reliable mispricing of assets by the APT remains.","['Gregory Connor', 'Robert A.
