Limited arbitrage in mergers and acquisitions,"A diversified portfolio of risk arbitrage positions produces an abnormal return of 0.6–0.9% per month over the period from 1981 to 1996. We trace these profits to practical limits on risk arbitrage. In our model of risk arbitrage, arbitrageurs’ risk-bearing capacity is constrained by deal completion risk and the size of the position they hold. Consistent with this model, we document that the returns to risk arbitrage increase in an ex ante measure of completion risk and target size. We also examine the influence of the general supply of arbitrage capital, measured by the total equity holdings of arbitrageurs, on arbitrage profits.","['Malcolm Baker', 'Serkan Savaşoglu']","['Arbitrage', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Market efficiency']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000727,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,1
"Asset liquidity, debt covenants, and managerial discretion in financial distress:","A hot growth stock in the 1980s, L.A. Gear's equity fell from $1 billion in market value in 1989 to zero in 1998. For over six years as revenues declined precipitously, management tried a series of radical strategy shifts while subsidizing the firm's large losses through working-capital liquidations. The L.A. Gear case illustrates that asset liquidity (broadly construed, not limited to excess cash) can give managers substantial operating discretion during financial distress. It also shows (1) that debt covenants can be stronger disciplinary mechanisms than requirements to meet cash interest payments, (2) why debt contracts typically constrain earnings instead of cash flow, (3) why cash balances are not equivalent to negative debt, and (4) why debt maturity matters. We find that many firms have highly liquid asset structures, thus their managers have the potential to subsidize losing operations should the need arise.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Karen H.

Who underreacts to cash-flow news? evidence from trading between individuals and institutions,"A large body of literature suggests that firm-level stock prices “underreact” to news about future cash flows; i.e., shocks to a firm's expected cash flows are positively correlated with shocks to expected returns on its stock. We examine the joint behavior of returns, cash-flow news, and trading between individuals and institutions. Institutions buy shares from (sell shares to) individuals in response to positive (negative) cash-flow news, thus exploiting the underreaction phenomenon. Institutions are not simply following price momentum strategies: When price goes up (down) in the absence of any cash-flow news, institutions sell shares to (buy shares from) individuals. Although institutions are trading in the “right” direction, institutions as a group outperform individuals by only 1.44% per annum before transaction and other costs, because they are extremely conservative in deviating from the value-weighted market index.","['Randolph B.

The impact of specialist firm acquisitions on market quality,"Acquisitions among New York Stock Exchange specialist firms can increase specialist firm size, capitalization, and market concentration, and thereby affect the market quality of the stocks they trade. We find that while traded stocks show significant improvement in several market quality measures following acquisitions, similar changes are evident in matched control stocks not involved in acquisitions. We conclude that specialist firm acquisitions either do not improve market quality, or improve market quality, but competitive and other pressures (resulting partly from the acquisitions themselves) force improvements in market quality for control stocks also. Either interpretation implies that specialist acquisitions have not had deleterious effects on market quality.","['Brian C. Hatch', 'Shane A.

Industry growth and capital allocation:,"Are market-based or bank-based financial systems better at financing the expansion of industries that depend heavily on external finance, facilitating the formation of new establishments, and improving the efficiency of capital allocation across industries?

While legal system efficiency and overall financial development boost industry growth, new establishment formation, and efficient capital allocation, having a bank-based or market-based system per se does not seem to matter much.","['Thorsten Beck', 'Ross Levine']","['Financial development', 'Financial structure', 'Law', 'Economic growth']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000740,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,2
Predicting the next step of a random walk: experimental evidence of regime-shifting beliefs,"Barberis et al. (J. Financial Econ. 49 (1998) 307), construct a model in which investors use the prevalence of past trend reversals as an indicator of the likelihood of future reversals. While such “regime-shifting” beliefs are consistent with a variety of psychological theories, other contrary predictions are consistent with the same theories. We report two experiments with MBA-student participants that strongly support the existence of regime-shifting beliefs. We conclude that regime-shifting models can provide a useful framework for understanding market anomalies, including underreactions to earnings changes and overreactions to long-term earnings trends.","['Robert Bloomfield', 'Jeffrey Hales']","['Market inefficiency', 'Regime shifting', 'Investor sentiment', 'Underreaction', 'Overreaction', 'Post-earnings-announcement drift']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001472,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,65,3
Asymmetric correlations of equity portfolios,"Correlations between U.S. stocks and the aggregate U.S. market are much greater for downside moves, especially for extreme downside moves, than for upside moves. We develop a new statistic for measuring, comparing, and testing asymmetries in conditional correlations. Conditional on the downside, correlations in the data differ from the conditional correlations implied by a normal distribution by 11.6%. We find that conditional asymmetric correlations are fundamentally different from other measures of asymmetries, such as skewness and co-skewness. We find that small stocks, value stocks, and past loser stocks have more asymmetric movements. Controlling for size, we find that stocks with lower betas exhibit greater correlation asymmetries, and we find no relationship between leverage and correlation asymmetries. Correlation asymmetries in the data reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normal distributions at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. However, several empirical models with greater flexibility, particularly regime-switching models, perform better at capturing correlation asymmetries.","['Andrew Ang', 'Joseph Chen']","['Stock return asymmetries', 'Correlation', 'Dispersion', 'Model bias', 'GARCH', 'Jump model', 'Regime-switching']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000685,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,63,3
Corporate leverage and currency crises,"Currency crises can arise because it is optimal to bail out financially distressed exporting firms through a currency depreciation. Exporting firms will not undertake profitable investments when high leverage causes debt overhang problems. A currency depreciation increases the profitability of new investments when revenues are foreign-currency denominated and domestic-currency costs are nominally rigid. Ex ante, currency depreciation leads to excessive investment in risky projects even if safer, more valuable projects are available. However, currency depreciation is optimal ex ante if the risky projects have higher expected returns and if firms must rely on debt financing because of underdeveloped equity markets.","['Arturo Bris', 'Yrjö Koskinen']","['Currency depreciation', 'Debt overhang', 'Emerging markets', 'Efficient investment policy', 'Excessive risk taking']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000976,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,63,2
Does diversification destroy value? Evidence from the industry shocks,"Does corporate diversification reduce shareholder value? Since firms endogenously choose to diversify, exogenous variation in diversification is necessary to draw inferences about the causal effect. We examine changes in the within-firm dispersion of industry investment, or “diversity”. We find that exogenous changes in diversity, due to changes in industry investment, are negatively related to firm value. Thus diversification destroys value, consistent with the inefficient internal capital markets hypothesis. Measurement error does not cause this finding. We also find that exogenous changes in industry cash flow diversity are negatively related to firm value.","['Owen A.

Mutual fund performance and seemingly unrelated assets,"Estimates of standard performance measures can be improved by using returns on assets not used to define those measures. Alpha, the intercept in a regression of a fund's return on passive benchmark returns, can be estimated more precisely by using information in returns on nonbenchmark passive assets, whether or not one believes those assets are priced by the benchmarks. A fund's Sharpe ratio can be estimated more precisely by using returns on other assets as well as the fund. New estimates of these performance measures for a large universe of equity mutual funds exhibit substantial differences from the usual estimates.","['Ľuboš Pástor', 'Robert F.

The bond/old-bond spread,"I document the profits on a trade that is long the old 30-year Treasury bond and short the new 30-year Treasury bond, and is rolled over every auction cycle from June 1995 to November 1999. Despite the systematic convergence of the spread over the auction cycle, the average profits are close to zero. The difference in repo-market financing rates between the two bonds is a significant cost of carry in this trade. I show that variation in the bond/old-bond spread is driven by the Treasury supply of 30-year bonds as well as aggregate factors affecting investors’ preference for liquid assets.",['Arvind Krishnamurthy'],"['Hedge funds', 'Short sales', 'CP-Bills spread', 'Aggregate liquidity', 'Liquidity crises']",[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002076,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,66,2
A cross-firm analysis of the impact of corporate governance on the East Asian financial crisis,"In a sample of 398 firms from Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, firm-level differences in variables related to corporate governance had a strong impact on firm performance during the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998. Significantly better stock price performance is associated with firms that had indicators of higher disclosure quality (ADRs and auditors from Big Six accounting firms), with firms that had higher outside ownership concentration, and with firms that were focused rather than diversified. The results suggest that individual firms have some power to preclude expropriation of minority shareholders if legal protection is inadequate.",['Todd Mitton'],"['Financial crises', 'Corporate governance', 'Disclosure', 'Ownership structure', 'Diversification']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000764,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,2
"Expectation puzzles, time-varying risk premia, and affine models of the term structure","Linear projections of returns on the slope of the yield curve have contradicted the implications of the traditional “expectations theory”. This paper shows that these findings are not puzzling relative to a large class of richer dynamic term structure models. Specifically, we match all the key empirical findings reported by Fama and Bliss ((1987) American Economic Review 77 (4), 680–692) and Campbell and Shiller ((1991) Review of Economic Studies 58, 495–514), among others, within large subclasses of affine and quadratic-Gaussian term structure models. Additionally, we show that certain “risk-premium adjusted” projections of changes in yields on the slope of the yield curve recover the coefficients of unity predicted by the models. Key to this matching are parameterizations of the market prices of risk that let the risk factors affect the market prices of risk directly, and not only through factor volatilities. The risk premiums have a simple form consistent with Fama's findings on the predictability of forward rates, and are also shown to be consistent with interest-rate feedback rules used by a monetary authority in setting monetary policy.","['Qiang Dai', 'Kenneth J.

Firm diversification and asymmetric information: evidence from analysts’ forecasts and earnings announcements,"Managers frequently cite the desire to mitigate asymmetric information as a motivation for increasing firm focus. The information benefits of focus appear relevant for the subset of firms that actually increase their focus; however, the relevance of focus-related information benefits for the population of diversified firms is an open question. This paper examines the relation between corporate diversification and asymmetric information proxies derived from analysts’ forecasts and abnormal returns associated with earnings announcements. I find that greater diversification is not associated with increased asymmetric information. These results call into question the notion that corporate diversification strictly exacerbates information problems.",['Shawn Thomas'],"['Transparency', 'Diversification', 'Focus', 'Asymmetric information', 'Corporate structure']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001290,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,3
"Strategic IPO underpricing, information momentum, and lockup expiration selling","Managers usually do not sell any of their own shares in an initial public offering but instead wait until the end of the lockup period. We develop a model in which managers strategically underprice IPOs to maximize personal wealth from selling shares at lockup expiration. First-day underpricing generates information momentum by attracting attention to the stock and thereby shifting the demand curve for the stock outwards. This allows managers to sell shares at the lockup expiration at prices higher than they would otherwise obtain. We test the model on a sample of IPOs in the 1990s. We find that higher ownership by managers is positively correlated with first-day underpricing, underpricing is positively correlated with research coverage, and research coverage is positively correlated with stock returns and insider selling at the lockup expiration. These results are consistent with the model.","['Rajesh K. Aggarwal', 'Laurie Krigman', 'Kent L.

Dating the integration of world equity markets,"Regulatory changes that appear comprehensive will have little impact on the functioning of a developing market if they fail to lead to foreign portfolio inflows. We specify a reduced-form model for a number of financial time series and search for a common, endogenous break in the data generating process. We also estimate a confidence interval for the break. Our endogenous break dates are accurately estimated but do not always correspond closely to dates of official capital market reforms. Indeed, the endogenous dates are usually later than official dates, highlighting the important distinction between market liberalization and market integration.","['Geert Bekaert', 'Campbell R.

Liquidity risk and specialness,"Repo contracts, the most important form of collateralized lending, are widely used by financial institutions and hedge funds to create short-selling positions and manage their leverage profile. Moreover, they have become the primary tool of money management and monetary control of several central banks, including the Bundesbank and the newly born European Central Bank. This paper is an empirical study of this market. More specifically, we study the extent to which the current term structure of long term “special” repo spreads discount the future collateral value (specialness) of Treasuries. We ask whether repo spreads embed a liquidity risk premium and whether such a risk premium is time-varying. We quantify the size of the average liquidity risk premium and we provide empirical evidence of the extent of its time-variation.","['Andrea Buraschi', 'Davide Menini']","['Liquidity risk', 'Treasury bonds', 'Repo contracts', 'Special repo rate', 'Expectation hypothesis', 'Treasury auctions']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000776,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,2
A theory of strategic venture investing,"Some venture capital investors seek purely financial gains while others, such as corporations, also pursue strategic objectives. The paper examines a model where a strategic investor can achieve synergies, but can also face a conflict of interest with the entrepreneur. If the start-up is a complement to the strategic partner, it is optimal to obtain funding from the strategic investor. If the start-up is a mild substitute, the entrepreneur prefers an independent venture capitalist. With a strong substitute, syndication becomes optimal, such that the independent venture capitalist is the active lead investor and the strategic partner a passive co-investor. The expected returns for the entrepreneur are nonmonotonic, lowest for a mild substitute, and higher for a strong substitute as well as for a complement. The paper also explains why a strategic investor often pays a higher valuation than an independent venture capitalist.",['Thomas Hellmann'],"['Venture capital', 'Strategic investing', 'Contracts', 'Valuation']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000788,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,2
Short-sale constraints and stock returns,"Stocks can be overpriced when short-sale constraints bind. We study the costs of short-selling equities from 1926 to 1933, using the publicly observable market for borrowing stock. Some stocks are sometimes expensive to short, and it appears that stocks enter the borrowing market when shorting demand is high. We find that stocks that are expensive to short or which enter the borrowing market have high valuations and low subsequent returns, consistent with the overpricing hypothesis. Size-adjusted returns are 1–2% lower per month for new entrants, and despite high costs it is profitable to short them.","['Charles M Jones', 'Owen A Lamont']","['Mispricing', 'Short-selling', 'Short-sale constraints', 'Securities lending']",[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002246,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,66,2
Divestitures and the liquidity of the market for corporate assets,"The liquidity of the market for corporate assets plays an important role in explaining whether a firm divests a business segment, which segment the firm divests, and whether it divests a core segment or an unrelated segment. Firms are more likely to divest segments from industries with a more liquid market for corporate assets, unrelated segments, poorly performing segments, and small segments. Strikingly, the segment with the least liquid market is less likely to be divested than the best-performing segment, while the worst-performing segment is less likely to be divested than the segment with the most liquid market.","['Frederik P.

Market efficiency in real time,"The Morning Call and Midday Call segments on CNBC TV provide a unique opportunity to study the efficient market hypothesis. The segments report analysts’ views about individual stocks and are broadcast when the market is open. We find that prices respond to reports within seconds of initial mention, with positive reports fully incorporated within one minute. Trading intensity doubles in the first minute, with a significant increase in buyer- (seller-) initiated trades after positive (negative) reports.

"Resources, real options, and corporate strategy","The types of investments a firm undertakes will depend in part on what it expects the outcome of those investments to reveal about its skills, capabilities, and assets (i.e., its resources). We predict that a firm will specialize when young, then experiment in a new line of business for some time, and then either expand into a large, multisegment business or focus and scale up its specialized business. We derive several empirical implications for firm valuations and the reaction of stock prices to news about firm prospects.

Growth opportunities and corporate debt policy: the case of the U.S. defense industry,"The U.S. defense industry provides a natural experiment for examining how changes in growth opportunities affect the level and structure of corporate debt. The growth opportunities of defense firms, compared with other firms, increased substantially during the Reagan defense buildup of the early 1980s but then declined significantly with the end of the cold war and associated defense budget cuts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We examine how the level and structure of corporate debt changed for a sample of 61 defense firms and a benchmark sample of 61 manufacturing firms during 1980–95, a period spanning the changes in growth opportunities. The debt levels of weapons manufacturers, which were most affected by the changes in growth opportunities, increased significantly as their growth opportunities declined. In addition, these firms lengthened the maturity structure of their debt, decreased the ratio of private to public debt, and decreased the use of senior debt as their growth opportunities declined. The results complement other studies that have found cross-sectional relations between proxies for growth opportunities and leverage variables and validate the prominent role played by growth opportunities in the theory of corporate finance.","['Vidhan K Goyal', 'Kenneth Lehn', 'Stanko Racic']","['Capital structure', 'Debt policy', 'Payout policy', 'Growth opportunities']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000703,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,1
Conditional performance measurement using portfolio weights: evidence for pension funds,"This paper combines the use of portfolio holdings data and conditioning information to create a new performance measure. Our conditional weight-based measure has several advantages. Using conditioning information avoids biases in weight-based measures as discussed by Grinblatt and Titman (J. Business 60 (1993)). When conditioning information is used, returns-based measures face a bias if managers can trade between observation dates. The new measures avoid this interim trading bias.

When a buyback isn’t a buyback: open market repurchases and employee options,"This paper examines how stock options affect the decision to repurchase shares. Firms announce repurchases when executives have large numbers of options outstanding and when employees have large numbers of options currently exercisable. Once the decision to repurchase is made, the amount repurchased is positively related to total options exercisable by all employees but independent of managerial options. These results are consistent with managers repurchasing both to maximize their own wealth and to fund employee stock option exercises. The market appears to recognize this motive, however, and reacts less positively to repurchases announced by firms with high levels of nonmanagerial options.",['Kathleen M Kahle'],"['Share repurchase', 'Executive stock options', 'Employee stock options']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000952,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,63,2
"Protection of minority shareholder interests, cross-listings in the United States, and subsequent equity offerings","This paper examines the hypothesis that non-US firms cross-list in the United States to increase protection of their minority shareholders. Cross-listing on the NYSE or Nasdaq subjects a non-US firm to a number of provisions of US securities law, and requires the firm to conform to US GAAP. It therefore increases the expected cost to managers of extracting private benefits, and commits the firm to protect minority shareholders’ interests. The expected relation between the quantity of cross-listings and shareholder protection in the home country is ambiguous, because managers will consider both expected private benefits and the public value of their shares. However, there are clear predictions about the relation between subsequent equity issues, shareholder protection, and cross-listings:(1)Equity issues increase following all cross-listings, regardless of shareholder protection.(2)The increase should be larger for cross-listings from countries with weak protection.(3)Equity issues following cross-listings in the US will tend to be in the US for firms from countries with strong protection and outside the US for firms from countries with weak protection.We find evidence consistent with each of these predictions. Overall, the desire to protect shareholder rights appears to be an important reason why some non-US firms cross-list in the United States.","['William A Reese', 'Michael S Weisbach']","['Cross-listings', 'Shareholder protection', 'Equity offerings', 'Legal systems']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001514,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,66,1

Depositor discipline and changing strategies for regulating thrift institutions,"This paper examines the role of uninsured deposits as a source of thrift funding from 1984 to 1994, and tests whether uninsured depositors have adjusted their holdings at thrifts in response to market forces, such as indications of impending institutional failure. It also examines how the reactions have changed over time as new legislation has been implemented. The study finds that failed institutions exhibit declining proportions of uninsured deposits-to-total-deposits prior to failure and that failing institutions attract fewer deposits from uninsured depositors prior to failure than do solvent institutions. Though there are some differences between the periods, the empirical results indicate that uninsured deposits will be governed by market discipline and that reducing the insurance limits on deposits will increase market discipline on thrifts.","['Lawrence G Goldberg', 'Sylvia C Hudgins']","['Depositor discipline', 'Uninsured deposits', 'Thrifts', 'Regulation']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000964,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,63,2
Agents watching agents?: evidence from pension fund ownership and firm value,"This paper examines the valuation effects associated with the incentive structures of different types of institutional investors using the ownership levels of public and private pension funds in a firm. The results suggest that institutional monitoring is associated with valuation effects when both observable and unobservable aspects of the relationship between institutions and firms are taken into account. Moreover, the valuation effects vary according to the objective functions of institutions’ administrators. Thus, other shareholders do not necessarily benefit from relationships between institutions and managers, and they could be hurt when the institutional agents watching firm agents have conflicts of interest with other shareholders.",['Tracie Woidtke'],"['Agency theory', 'Institutional investors', 'Corporate governance', 'Ownership structure']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000915,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,63,1
Do after-tax returns affect mutual fund inflows?,"This paper explores the relationship between the after-tax returns that taxable investors earn on equity mutual funds and the subsequent cash inflows to these funds. Previous studies have documented that funds with high pretax returns attract greater inflows. This paper presents evidence, based on a large sample of retail equity mutual funds over the period 1993–1999, that after-tax returns have more explanatory power than pretax returns in explaining inflows. In addition, funds with large overhangs of unrealized capital gains experience smaller inflows, all else equal, than funds without such unrealized gains. A large capital gain overhang discourages both gross fund inflows and gross outflows, but the inflow effect dominates the outflow effect.","['Daniel Bergstresser', 'James Poterba']","['Mutual funds', 'Income taxation', 'Taxes and portfolio choice', 'After-tax returns']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000661,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,63,3

We estimate the EPK on a monthly basis from 1991 to 1995, using S&P 500 index option data and a stochastic volatility model for the S&P 500 return process. We find that the EPK exhibits counter cyclical risk aversion over S&P 500 return states.

Pricing and capital allocation in catastrophe insurance,"This paper studies multi-line pricing and capital allocation by insurance companies when solvency matters to consumers, capital is costly to hold, and the average loss is uncertain. In this environment, product quality concerns lead firms to diversify across markets and charge high prices for risk that threatens company solvency, even if the risk is unrelated to other asset risk.

Governance with poor investor protection: evidence from top executive turnover in Italy,"This paper studies the determinants of executive turnover and firm valuation as a function of ownership and control structure in Italy, a country that features low legal protection for investors, firms with controlling shareholders, and pyramidal groups. The results suggest that there is poor governance, as measured by a low sensitivity of turnover to performance and a low Q ratio, when (i) the controlling shareholders are also top executives, (ii) the control is fully in the hands of one shareholder and is not shared by a set of core shareholders, and (iii) the controlling shareholders own less than 50% of the firm's cash-flow rights.",['Paolo F.

The market for borrowing stock,"To short a stock, an arbitrageur must first borrow it. This paper describes the market for borrowing and lending U.S. equities, emphasizing the conditions generating and sustaining short-sale constraints. A large institutional lending intermediary provided eighteen months (4/2000–9/2001) of data on loan supply (“shortability”), loan fees (“specialness”), and loan recalls. The data suggest that while loan market specials and recalls are rare on average, the incidence of these short-sale constraints is increasing in the divergence of opinion among investors. Beyond some threshold, investor optimism itself can limit arbitrage via the loan market mechanism.",['Gene D’Avolio'],"['Short-sale constraints', 'Securities lending', 'Limits to arbitrage', 'Divergence of opinion']",[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002064,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,66,2
"Order imbalance, liquidity, and market returns","Traditionally, volume has provided the link between trading activity and returns. We focus on a hitherto unexplored but intuitive measure of trading activity: the aggregate daily order imbalance, buy orders less sell orders, on the New York Stock Exchange. Order imbalance increases following market declines and vice versa, which reveals that investors are contrarians on aggregate. Order imbalances in either direction, excess buy or sell orders, reduce liquidity. Market-wide returns are strongly affected by contemporaneous and lagged order imbalances. Market returns reverse themselves after high-negative-imbalance, large-negative-return days. Even after controlling for aggregate volume and liquidity, market returns are affected by order imbalance.","['Tarun Chordia', 'Richard Roll', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam']","['Liquidity', 'Trading volume', 'Order imbalance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001368,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,65,1
The value of durable bank relationships: evidence from Korean banking shocks,"Using a large sample of exogenous events that negatively affected Korean banks during the 1997–98 period, we examine the value of durable bank relationships in Korea. We show that adverse shocks to banks have a negative effect not only on the value of the banks themselves but also on the value of their client firms, and that this adverse effect on firm value is a decreasing function of the financial health of both the banks and their client firms. Our results are concentrated in the second half of the sample period when Korean banks experienced severe difficulties.","['Kee-Hong Bae', 'Jun-Koo Kang', 'Chan-Woo Lim']","['Bank durability', 'Main bank', 'Korean banking crisis', 'Bank relationship', 'Client firm value']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02000752,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,2
How does the Internet affect trading? Evidence from investor behavior in 401(k) plans,"We analyze the impact of a Web-based trading channel on trader behavior and performance in two large corporate 401(k) plans. After 18 months of Web access, trading frequency at sample firms doubles relative to a control group of firms without a Web channel. Web trades tend to be smaller than trades made through other channels and Web traders tend to have smaller portfolios than other traders, so the Web's impact on portfolio turnover is substantially smaller than its effect on trading frequency. There is no evidence than any of this new trading on the Web is successful.","['James J.

The ultimate ownership of Western European corporations,"We analyze the ultimate ownership and control of 5,232 corporations in 13 Western European countries. Typically firms are widely held (36.93%) or family controlled (44.29%). Widely held firms are more important in the UK and Ireland, family controlled firms in continental Europe. Financial and large firms are more likely widely held, while non-financial and small firms are more likely family controlled. State control is important for larger firms in certain countries. Dual class shares and pyramids enhance the control of the largest shareholders, but overall there are significant discrepancies between ownership and control in only a few countries.","['Mara Faccio', 'Larry H.P Lang']","['Ownership structure', 'Corporate governance']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001460,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,65,3
Synchronization risk and delayed arbitrage,We argue that arbitrage is limited if rational traders face uncertainty about when their peers will exploit a common arbitrage opportunity. This synchronization risk—which is distinct from noise trader risk and fundamental risk—arises in our model because arbitrageurs become sequentially aware of mispricing and they incur holding costs. We show that rational arbitrageurs “time the market” rather than correct mispricing right away. This leads to delayed arbitrage. The analysis suggests that behavioral influences on prices are resistant to arbitrage in the short and intermediate run.,"['Dilip Abreu', 'Markus K Brunnermeier']","['Limits to arbitrage', 'Synchronization risk', 'Market timing', 'Efficient markets hypothesis', 'Behavioral finance']",[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002271,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,66,2
Investing in equity mutual funds,"We construct optimal portfolios of equity funds by combining historical returns on funds and passive indexes with prior views about asset pricing and skill. By including both benchmark and nonbenchmark indexes, we distinguish pricing-model inaccuracy from managerial skill. Modest confidence in a pricing model helps construct portfolios with high Sharpe ratios. Investing in active mutual funds can be optimal even for investors who believe managers cannot outperform passive indexes. Optimal portfolios exclude hot-hand funds even for investors who believe momentum is priced.

Breadth of ownership and stock returns,"We develop a stock market model with differences of opinion and short-sales constraints. When breadth is low—i.e., when few investors have long positions—this signals that the short-sales constraint is binding tightly, and that prices are high relative to fundamentals. Thus reductions in breadth should forecast lower returns. Using data on mutual fund holdings, we find that stocks whose change in breadth in the prior quarter is in the lowest decile of the sample underperform those in the top decile by 6.38% in the twelve months after formation. Adjusting for size, book-to-market, and momentum, the figure is 4.95%.","['Joseph Chen', 'Harrison Hong', 'Jeremy C.

Econometric models of limit-order executions,"We develop and estimate an econometric model of limit-order execution times using survival analysis and actual limit-order data. We estimate versions for time-to-first-fill and time-to-completion for both buy and sell limit orders, and incorporate the effects of explanatory variables such as the limit price, limit size, bid/offer spread, and market volatility. Execution times are very sensitive to the limit price, but are not sensitive to limit size. Hypothetical limit-order executions, constructed either theoretically from first-passage times or empirically from transactions data, are very poor proxies for actual limit-order executions.","['Andrew W.

IPO allocations: discriminatory or discretionary?,"We estimate the structural links between IPO allocations, pre-market information production, and initial underpricing and find that (1) allocation policies favor institutional investors, both in the US and worldwide; (2) increasing institutional allocations results in offer prices that deviate more from the pre-marketing price range; (3) constraints on bankers’ discretion reduce institutional allocations and result in smaller price revisions, indicating diminished information production; and (4) initial returns are directly related to information production and inversely related to institutional allocations. Our results indicate that discretionary allocations promote price discovery in the IPO market and reduce indirect issuance costs for IPO firms.","['Alexander P Ljungqvist', 'William J Wilhelm']","['Initial public offerings', 'Bookbuilding', 'Underpricing', 'Intermediation', 'Allocation policy']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001381,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,65,2
Performance consequences of mandatory increases in executive stock ownership,"We examine a sample of firms that adopt “target ownership plans”, under which managers are required to own a minimum amount of stock. We find that prior to plan adoption, such firms exhibit low managerial equity ownership and low stock price performance. Managerial equity ownership increases significantly in the two years following plan adoption. We also observe that excess accounting returns and stock returns are higher after the plan is adopted. Thus, for our sample of firms, the required increases in the level of managerial equity ownership result in improvements in firm performance.","['John E. Core', 'David F.

The dilution impact of daily fund flows on open-end mutual funds,"We examine how mutual fund flows that are correlated with subsequent fund returns can have a dilution impact on the performance of open-end funds. Active trading of open-end funds has a meaningful economic impact on the returns of passive, nontrading shareholders, particularly in U.S.-based international funds. The overall sample of domestic equity funds shows no dilution impact, but we find an annualized negative impact of 0.48% in international funds (and nearly 1% for a subsample of funds whose daily flows are particularly large). The exchange and pricing policies of mutual funds can thus have important performance-related implications.","['Jason T Greene', 'Charles W Hodges']","['Mutual funds', 'Flows', 'Daily fund flows']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0200137X,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,65,1
Liquidity provision and specialist trading in NYSE-listed non-U.S. stocks,"We examine how the intrinsic differences between U.S. and non-U.S. stocks affect market participants and the market quality of non-U.S. stocks relative to U.S. stocks. Using proprietary data on NYSE specialist trading, we find that, all else equal, specialist closing inventory positions for non-U.S. stocks are closer to zero than U.S. stocks. The evidence on specialist participation and stabilization rates is mixed. Non-U.S. stocks from developed markets have higher specialist participation and stabilization rates than U.S. stocks, while emerging market stocks have lower participation and stabilization rates than U.S. stocks. With respect to market quality, we find that, all else equal, non-U.S. stocks have wider spreads, less depth, and greater transitory volatility than U.S. stocks. We investigate the reasons behind the difference in liquidity and find that the larger non-U.S. spreads are primarily due to higher information asymmetry and increased adverse selection risk. We conclude that liquidity providers demand greater compensation for trading non-U.S. stocks, but this additional compensation is necessary to offset the higher adverse selection risk.","['Jeffrey M.

Building the IPO order book: underpricing and participation limits with costly information,"We examine the book-building method for marketing IPOs. In our model, the underwriter selects a group of investors along with a pricing and allocation mechanism to maximize (at minimum cost) the information generated during the process of going public. We also address the moral hazard problem faced by investors when evaluation is costly. When there is little need for accurate pricing, the expected gain from underpricing exactly offsets the investors’ costs of acquiring information. When pricing accuracy is important, however, the number of investors participating in the offering is larger, underpricing is greater, and investors can earn economic rents.","['Ann E.

Litigation risk and IPO underpricing,"We examine the relation between risk and IPO underpricing and test two aspects of the litigation-risk hypothesis: (1) firms with higher litigation risk underprice their IPOs by a greater amount as a form of insurance (insurance effect) and (2) higher underpricing lowers expected litigation costs (deterrence effect). To adjust for the endogeneity bias in previous studies, we use a simultaneous equation framework. Evidence provides support for both aspects of the litigation-risk hypothesis.","['Michelle Lowry', 'Susan Shu']","['Initial public offering', 'IPO underpricing', 'Securities litigation', 'Endogeneity']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001447,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,65,3

Funding growth in bank-based and market-based financial systems: evidence from firm-level data,"We investigate whether firms’ access to external financing to fund growth differs in market-based and bank-based financial systems. Using firm-level data for 40 countries, we compute the proportion of firms in each country relying on external finance and examine how that proportion differs across financial systems. We find that the development of a country's legal system predicts access to external finance, and stock markets and the banking system affect access to external finance differently. However, we find no evidence that firms’ access to external financing is predicted by several proxies for relative development of stock markets to the development of the banking system.","['Aslı Demirgüç-Kunt', 'Vojislav Maksimovic']","['Financial system', 'Firm growth', 'Law', 'Financial institutions']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001459,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,65,3
"Securities lending, shorting, and pricing","We present a model of asset valuation in which short-selling requires searching for security lenders and bargaining over the lending fee. If lendable securities are difficult to locate, then the price of the security is initially elevated, and expected to decline. This price decline is to be anticipated, for example, after an initial public offering, and is increasing in the degree of heterogeneity of beliefs about the future value of the security. The prospect of lending fees may push the initial price of a security above even the most optimistic buyer's valuation of the security's future dividends. A higher price can thus be obtained with some shorting than if shorting is disallowed.","['Darrell Duffie', 'Nicolae Gârleanu', 'Lasse Heje Pedersen']","['Shorting', 'Lending fee', 'Pricing', 'Differences of opinion']",[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0200226X,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,66,2

Simulated likelihood estimation of diffusions with an application to exchange rate dynamics in incomplete markets,"We present an econometric method for estimating the parameters of a diffusion model from discretely sampled data. The estimator is transparent, adaptive, and inherits the asymptotic properties of the generally unattainable maximum likelihood estimator. We use this method to estimate a new continuous-time model of the joint dynamics of interest rates in two countries and the exchange rate between the two currencies. The model allows financial markets to be incomplete and specifies the degree of incompleteness as a stochastic process. Our empirical results offer several new insights into the dynamics of exchange rates.","['Michael W.

Equilibrium and welfare in markets with financially constrained arbitrageurs,"We propose a multiperiod model in which competitive arbitrageurs exploit discrepancies between the prices of two identical risky assets traded in segmented markets. Arbitrageurs need to collateralize separately their positions in each asset, and this implies a financial constraint limiting positions as a function of wealth. In our model, arbitrage activity benefits all investors because arbitrageurs supply liquidity to the market. However, arbitrageurs might fail to take a socially optimal level of risk, in the sense that a change in their positions can make all investors better off. We characterize conditions under which arbitrageurs take too much or too little risk.","['Denis Gromb', 'Dimitri Vayanos']",[],[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002283,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,66,2
Stock return predictability and model uncertainty,"We use Bayesian model averaging to analyze the sample evidence on return predictability in the presence of model uncertainty. The analysis reveals in-sample and out-of-sample predictability, and shows that the out-of-sample performance of the Bayesian approach is superior to that of model selection criteria. We find that term and market premia are robust predictors. Moreover, small-cap value stocks appear more predictable than large-cap growth stocks. We also investigate the implications of model uncertainty from investment management perspectives. We show that model uncertainty is more important than estimation risk, and investors who discard model uncertainty face large utility losses.",['Doron Avramov'],"['Stock return predictability', 'Model uncertainty', 'Bayesian model averaging', 'Portfolio selection', 'Variance decomposition']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02001319,Journal of Financial Economics,2002,64,3

Stocks are special too: an analysis of the equity lending market,"With a year of equity loans by a major lender, we measure the effect of actual short-selling costs and constraints on trading strategies that involve short-selling. We find the loans of initial public offering (IPOs), DotCom, large-cap, growth and low-momentum stocks to be cheap relative to the strategies’ documented profits and that investors who can short only stocks that are cheap and easy to borrow can enjoy at least some of the profits of unconstrained investors. Most IPOs are loaned on their first settlement days and throughout their first months, and the underperformance around lockup expiration is significant even for the IPOs that are cheap and easy to borrow. The effect of short-selling frictions appears strongest in merger arbitrage. Acquirers’ stock is expensive to borrow, especially when the acquirer is small, though the major influence on trading profits is not through expense but availability.","['Christopher C.
