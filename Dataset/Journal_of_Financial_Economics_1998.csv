Managerial compensation and the threat of takeover,"A greater threat of takeover has two opposing effects on managerial compensation. The competition effect in the market for managers reduces compensation. The risk effect increases compensation by making managers' implicitly deferred compensation and firm-specific human capital less secure. Using a sample of about 450 large firms, we find that an increase in the threat of takeover from the first to the third quartile reduces a typical CEO's salary and bonus by $22,800–211,600 due to the competition effect, but raises salary and bonus by $41,500–255,300 due to the risk effect. The net effect is an increase of $18,700–43,700.","['Anup Agrawal', 'Charles R.

Capital budgeting and delegation1,"As part of our ongoing research into capital budgeting processes as responses to decentralized information and incentive problems, we focus in this paper on when a level of a managerial hierarchy will delegate the allocation of capital across projects and time to the level below it. In our model, delegation is a way to save on costly investigation of proposed projects. Therefore, it is more extensive the larger are the costs of such investigations. This delegation takes advantage of the fact that the lower-level manager's preferences are assumed to be similar (though not identical) to those of the higher level.","['Milton Harris', 'Artur Raviv']","['Capital budgeting', 'Delegation', 'Budget rollovers']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000385,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,50,3
Open-end mutual funds and capital-gains taxes1,"Despite the fact that taxable investors would prefer to defer the realization of capital gains indefinitely, most open-end mutual funds regularly realize and distribute a large portion of their gains. We present a model in which unrealized gains in the fund's portfolio increase expected future taxable distributions, and thus increase the present value of a new investor's tax liability. In equilibrium, managers interested in attracting new investors pass through taxable capital gains to reduce the overhang of unrealized gains. This model contains a number of empirical predictions that are consistent with data on actual fund overhangs.","['Michael J. Barclay', 'Neil D. Pearson', 'Michael S.

"Information problems, conflicts of interest, and asset stripping:","Eastern Airlines' bankruptcy illustrates the devastating effect on firm value of court-sponsored asset stripping, i.e., the use of creditors' collateral to invest in high-variance negative net present value projects. During its bankruptcy, Eastern's value dropped over 50%. A substantial portion of this value decline occurred because an overprotective court insulated Eastern from market forces and allowed value-destroying operations to continue long after it was clear that Eastern should have been shut down. The failure of Eastern's Chapter 11 demonstrates the importance of having a bankruptcy process that protects a distressed firm's assets, not simply from a run by creditors, but also from overly optimistic managers and misguided judges.","['Lawrence A.

Debt and the terms of employment1,"For the last two decades, firms with higher debt have reduced their employment more often, used more part time and seasonal employees, paid lower wages, and funded pension plans less generously. These effects are economically significant and cannot be explained by variation in performance. Thus debt seems to discipline the employment relationship. However, this result reflects a clear historical reversal, during the years 1967–73, of the opposite effect that prevailed in the 1950s. Apparently some of the disciplinary effects of debt are driven by forces that emerged during the period now colloquially referred to as the Sixties.",['Gordon Hanka'],"['Capital structure', 'Employment', 'Wages']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000129,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,48,3
The impact of contingent liability on commercial bank risk taking,"From 1863–1935, regulators imposed contingent liability on bank shareholders to discourage risk taking. Using data from 1900 to 1915, I find that banks subject to stricter liability rules have lower equity and asset volatility, hold a lower proportion of risky assets, and are less likely to increase their investment in risky assets when their net worth declines, consistent with the hypothesis that stricter liability discourages commercial bank risk taking. These findings provide lessons for current bank regulatory policy and show that the shape of the residual claimant's payoff function has a significant impact on managerial incentives and firm performance.",['Benjamin C.

Going public and the ownership structure of the firm,"Going public is a complex process with distinct markets for dispersed shares and controlling blocks. It is important to design the sale of new shares with the final ownership structure in mind. An optimal strategy for going public starts with the IPO, which is particularly suited for the sale of dispersed holdings to small and passive investors. The marketing of potentially controlling blocks to active investors should occur subsequently. We develop a framework for evaluating alternative methods of sale and show that discriminating in favor of active investors can raise the market value of the firm for all shareholders.","['Antonio S.

The exercise and valuation of executive stock options1,"In theory, hedging restrictions faced by managers make executive stock options more difficult to value than ordinary options, because they imply that exercise policies of managers depend on their preferences and endowments. Using data on option exercises from 40 firms, this paper shows that a simple extension of the ordinary American option model which introduces random, exogenous exercise and forfeiture predicts actual exercise times and payoffs just as well as an elaborate utility-maximizing model that explicitly accounts for the nontransferability of options. The simpler model could therefore be more useful than the preference-based model for valuing executive options in practice.",['Jennifer N.

Share repurchases and firm performance:,"In this paper we examine tender offer share repurchases to differentiate between the information signaling and free cash flow hypotheses. Previous work in this area has focused on announcement period returns. While we also examine announcement returns, our primary emphasis is on operating performance changes surrounding repurchases. We argue that the information contained in changes in operating performance, and its determinants, enables us to differentiate between the two hypotheses. Our primary finding is that operating performance following repurchases improves only in low-growth firms, and that these gains are generated by more efficient utilization of assets, and asset sales, rather than improved growth opportunities. Thus, repurchases do not appear to be pure financial transactions meant to change the firm's capital structure but are part of a restructuring package meant to shrink the assets of the firm. This evidence leads us to conclude that the positive investor reaction to repurchases is best explained by the free cash flow hypothesis.","['Tom Nohel', 'Vefa Tarhan']","['Share repurchases', 'Free cash flow', 'Signaling', 'Restructuring']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000221,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,49,2
Why do stock prices drop by less than the value of the dividend? Evidence from a country without taxes,"It is well documented that stock prices on ex-dividend days drop by less than the value of the dividend, on average. This has commonly been attributed to the effect of tax clienteles. We examine data from the Hong Kong stock market, where neither dividends nor capital gains are taxed. As in the U.S., the average stock price drop is less than the value of the dividend; specifically, the average dividend for the period 1980–1993 is HK $0.12 and the average price drop is HK $0.06. We are able to account for this both theoretically and empirically through market microstructure arguments.","['Murray Frank', 'Ravi Jagannathan']","['Asset Pricing', 'Dividends', 'Bid-Ask Spread', 'Market Microstructure']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97800530,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,47,2
"Market efficiency, long-term returns, and behavioral finance1","Market efficiency survives the challenge from the literature on long-term return anomalies. Consistent with the market efficiency hypothesis that the anomalies are chance results, apparent overreaction to information is about as common as underreaction, and post-event continuation of pre-event abnormal returns is about as frequent as post-event reversal.

Ancient redwoods and the politics of finance: The hostile takeover of the Pacific Lumber Company,"Pacific Lumber was acquired in 1986 by MAXXAM, whose decision to double PL's harvest of old-growth redwoods precipitated 11 years of environmental protests. Intense media coverage blames the Drexel-financed takeover for threatening Headwaters Forest, the largest privately owned ancient redwood forest. This ‘Wall Street greed’ portrayal aroused such public outrage that the Clinton administration agreed to pay $380 million for Headwaters weeks before the 1996 election. We establish that the threat to Head-waters is not attributable to MAXXAM's junk bond-financed takeover. Government's response to dramatic crises encourages interest groups to use emotional appeals to influence resource allocation.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo']","['Takeovers', 'Junk bonds', 'Politics of finance', 'Environmental economics']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000366,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,47,1
The relation between implied and realized volatility1,"Previous research finds the volatility implied by S&P 100 index option prices to be a biased and inefficient forecast of future volatility and to contain little or no incremental information beyond that in past realized volatility. In contrast, we find that implied volatility outperforms past volatility in forecasting future volatility and even subsumes the information content of past volatility in some of our specifications. Our results differ from previous studies because we use longer time series and nonoverlapping data. A regime shift around the October 1987 crash explains why implied volatility is more biased in previous work.","['B.J. Christensen', 'N.R.

Earnings management and the performance of seasoned equity offerings1,"Recent studies document that firms conducting seasoned equity offerings experience poor stock price and earnings performance in the post-offering period. I investigate whether earnings management around the time of the offering can explain a portion of the poor performance. Consistent with this explanation, I show that earnings management during the year around the offering predicts both earnings changes and market-adjusted stock returns in the following year. These findings suggest that the stock market temporarily overvalues issuing firms and is subsequently disappointed by predictable declines in earnings caused by earnings management.",['Srinivasan Rangan'],"['Seasoned equity offerings', 'Earnings management', 'Market efficiency']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000336,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,50,1

We find that after conversion and the expiration of ownership-structure restrictions, firm performance improves significantly, and the portions of the firm owned by managers and the firm's employee stock ownership plan increase. Changes in performance are positively associated with changes in ownership by managers, but negatively associated with changes in ownership by employee stock ownership plans.","['Rebel A.

Earnings management and the underperformance of seasoned equity offerings1,"Seasoned equity issuers can raise reported earnings by altering discretionary accounting accruals. We find that issuers who adjust discretionary current accruals to report higher net income prior to the offering have lower post-issue long-run abnormal stock returns and net income. Interestingly, the relation between discretionary current accruals and future returns (adjusted for firm size and book-to-market ratio) is stronger and more persistent for seasoned equity issuers than for non-issuers. The evidence is consistent with investors naively extrapolating pre-issue earnings without fully adjusting for the potential manipulation of reported earnings.","['Siew Hong Teoh', 'Ivo Welch', 'T.J.

Ex dividend day stock price behavior: discreteness or tax-induced clienteles?,"Since prices are constrained to discrete tick multiples while dividends are essentially continuous, ex day price changes will not equal dividends. We argue that the expected price drop is strictly less than the dividend but within one tick of the dividend. The price-drop-to-dividend ratio will (i) be less than one, (ii) increase with dividends generally, and (iii) decline between tick multiples, giving a sawtooth pattern in the data. Since dividends and dividend yields are highly correlated, discreteness will give the impression of tax-induced dividend clienteles even if there are none. Taxable cash dividends and nontaxable stock dividends exhibit similar ex day behavior.","['Rakesh Bali', 'Gailen L.

Book-to-market ratios as predictors of market returns1,"The book-to-market ratio of the Dow Jones Industrial Average predicts market returns and small firm excess returns over the period 1926–1994. The DJIA book-to-market ratio contains information about future returns that is not captured by other variables such as interest yield spreads and dividend yields. The DJIA book-to-market ratio's predictive ability is specific to the pre-1960 sample. In contrast, the S&P book-to-market ratio provides some predictive ability in the post-1960 period, although this relation is dramatically weaker than the Dow Jones pre-1960 findings. The predictive ability of book-to-market ratios appears to stem from the relation between book value and future earnings.","['Jeffrey Pontiff', 'Lawrence D.

Venture capital and the structure of capital markets: banks versus stock markets1,"The United States has many banks that are small relative to large corporations and play a limited role in corporate governance, and a well developed stock market with an associated market for corporate control. In contrast, Japanese and German banks are fewer in number but larger in relative size and are said to play a central governance role. Neither country has an active market for corporate control. We extend the debate on the relative efficiency of bank- and stock market-centered capital markets by developing a further systematic difference between the two systems: the greater vitality of venture capital in stock market-centered systems. Understanding the link between the stock market and the venture capital market requires understanding the contractual arrangements between entrepreneurs and venture capital providers; especially, the importance of the opportunity to enter into an implicit contract over control, which gives a successful entrepreneur the option to reacquire control from the venture capitalist by using an initial public offering as the means by which the venture capitalist exits from a portfolio investment. We also extend the literature on venture capital contracting by offering an explanation for two central characteristics of the U.S. venture capital market: relatively rapid exit by venture capital providers from investments in portfolio companies; and the common practice of exit through an initial public offering.","['Bernard S Black', 'Ronald J Gilson']","['Venture Capital', 'Exit Strategy', 'IPO', 'Comparative corporate governance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000457,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,47,3
An empirical examination of the amortized spread1,"Theories of asset pricing suggest that the amortized cost of the spread is relevant to investors' required returns. The amortized spread measures the spread's cost over investors' holding periods and is approximately equal to the spread times share turnover. We examine amortized spreads for Amex and NYSE stocks over the period 1983–1992. We find that stocks with similar spreads can have vastly different share turnover, and thus, a stock's amortized spread cannot be predicted reliably by its spread alone. Consistent with theories of transaction costs, we find stronger evidence that amortized spreads are priced than we find for unamortized spreads.","['John M.R. Chalmers', 'Gregory B.

"IPO-mechanisms, monitoring and ownership structure1","This paper analyzes the effect of different IPO mechanisms on the structure of share ownership and explores the role of underpricing and rationing in determining investors’ shareholdings. We focus on the agency problem that results when large institutions are the only investors capable of monitoring the firm whereas small shareholders free-ride on these activities. The major conclusion is that some well-known aspects of IPOs may be explained as rational responses by the issuer to the existence of regulatory constraints in public capital markets. There is a two-stage offering mechanism in which the investment banker, acting in the interests of the issuer, optimally rations the allotment of shares to small investors in order to capture the benefits associated with better monitoring by institutions. Importantly, in our model, the existence of underpricing (and oversubscription) is an indication that the issuer has received a higher ex ante price than would have been obtained through a competitive Walrasian-type offering process.","['Neal M Stoughton', 'Josef Zechner']","['IPOs', 'Monitoring', 'Institutions', 'Underwriting']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000178,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,49,1
Why firms issue convertible bonds: The matching of financial and real investment options,"This paper contends that corporations use callable, convertible bonds to lower the issuance costs of sequential financing. Sequential financing increases issue costs but helps control overinvestment incentives that can arise if financing is provided prior to an investment option's maturity. A convertible bond's conversion option reduces issue costs while helping to control the overinvestment incentive. Evidence of important investment and financing activity around the time convertible bonds are called and converted supports the hypothesis.

Across stocks, specialist dealer trading varies widely and is inversely related to trading volume and proxies for off-exchange competition. Over time in an individual stock, specialists participate more actively as sellers (buyers) when holding long (short) inventory positions. This results suggest that dealers control their inventory positions by selectively timing the size and direction of their trades rather than by adjusting their quotes.

"Employee buyouts: causes, structure, and consequences1","This paper investigates the motivations for and consequences of including a broad group of employees in leveraged buyouts by comparing employee buyouts (EBOs) to transactions where only top level managers participate, or management buyouts (MBOs). We examine the implications of including employees in a buyout from a labor contracting, financing, and management control point of view. A major finding is that employee participation helps to finance the buyout. The EBO allows firms to gain access to excess pension assets by converting employees' defined benefit pension capital into equity claims, thus freeing the excess assets in the pension plan to help fund the buyout. Also, employee participation substitutes equity claims for cash labor compensation costs and therefore allows the firm to borrow more than otherwise would be possible. There is also evidence consistent with managers including employees to maintain or enhance incumbent management's control.","['Susan Chaplinsky', 'Greg Niehaus', 'Linda Van de Gucht']","['ESOP', 'LBO', 'Employee ownership', 'Labor contracts']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000130,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,48,3

We operationalize preferencing by allowing some dealers to execute a portion of the order flow by matching the most favorable quotes available. Increasing the proportion of order flow that is preferenced can increase bid–ask spreads, reduce the informational efficiency of prices, and benefit dealers at the expense of liquidity traders. Preferencing has none of these effects, however, when two or more dealers are not receiving preferencing orders. Preferencing may significantly degrade market performance if preferencing arrangements affect all, or virtually all, dealers.","['Robert Bloomfield', ""Maureen O'Hara""]","['Market microstructure', 'Dealer markets', 'Nasdaq', 'Preferencing']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000300,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,50,1
CEO incentive plans and corporate liquidation policy1,"To investigate CEOs' incentives to liquidate their firms, we examine the effects of insider ownership and compensation in stock options on 30 voluntary liquidation decisions by industrial firms in the period 1975–1986. We find that liquidation decisions are influenced by CEO incentive plans and increase shareholder value. Firms with more outside board members, smaller market-to-book ratios, and attempts by outsiders to gain control are more likely to be liquidated. Although few top executives of liquidating firms subsequently take comparable jobs, at least 41% of CEOs who downsize are made better off by liquidation.","['Hamid Mehran', 'George E.

"Risk management, capital budgeting, and capital structure policy for financial institutions: An integrated approach","We develop a framework for analyzing the capital allocation and capital structure decisions facing financial institutions. Our model incorporates two key features: (i) value-maximizing banks have a well-founded concern with risk management; and (ii) not all the risks they face can be frictionlessly hedged in the capital market. This approach allows us to show how bank-level risk management considerations should factor into the pricing of those risks that cannot be easily hedged. We examine several applications, including: the evaluation of proprietary trading operations, and the pricing of unhedgeable derivatives positions. We also compare our approach to the RAROC methodology that has been adopted by a number of banks.","['Kenneth A. Froot', 'Jeremy C.

The indirect economic penalties in SEC investigations of underwriters1,"We document that an SEC investigation of an underwriter imposes indirect penalties on the underwriter and its past clients, particularly IPO clients. Targeted underwriters experience large declines in IPO market share and increased regulatory scrutiny and client risk after an SEC investigation is announced. Stock prices of clients decline significantly. We attribute these effects to a sudden deterioration in the value of the underwriter's reputation capital, suggesting that the general assumption in prior IPO research that underwriter reputation is stationary may be inappropriate. Our results also suggest that the SEC's power to institute investigations should be considered when designing optimal securities regulation.","['Randolph P Beatty', 'Howard Bunsis', 'John R.M Hand']","['Underwriter reputation', 'SEC investigations', 'Indirect penalties', 'Optimal regulation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X9800035X,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,50,2
How big is the premium for currency risk?1,"We estimate and test the conditional version of an International Capital Asset Pricing Model using a parsimonious multivariate GARCH process. Since our approach is fully parametric, we can recover any quantity that is a function of the first two conditional moments. Our findings strongly support a model which includes both market and foreign exchange risk. However, both sources of risk are only detected when their prices are allowed to change over time. The evidence also indicates that, with the exception of the U.S. equity market, the premium for bearing currency risk often represents a significant fraction of the total premium.","['Giorgio De Santis', 'Bruno Gérard']","['International asset pricing', 'Currency risk', 'Multivariate GARCH']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000294,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,49,3
The economics of parent-subsidiary mergers:,"We examine parent-subsidiary mergers, transactions that do not entail arm's length bargaining or a change in control. These mergers are typically followed by considerable restructuring of subsidiaries. Minority and parent returns are not significantly different from returns at third party buyouts of parent-controlled subsidiaries, transactions that entail arm's length negotiations and a change in control. Buyer returns are negative, consistent with overbidding. We conclude that parent-subsidiary mergers facilitate corporate restructuring, foster the reallocation of resources toward higher valued uses, and increase value for both parent and subsidiary.","['Myron B.

The effects of bank mergers and acquisitions on small business lending1,"We examine the effects of bank M&As on small business lending using data on over 6000 recent U.S. bank M&As. We are the first to decompose the impact of M&As into the static effects from simply melding the antecedent institutions and the dynamic effects associated with post-M&A refocusing of the consolidated institution. We are also the first to estimate the dynamic reactions of other local banks. We find that the static effects of consolidation reduce small business lending, but are mostly offset by the reactions of other banks, and in some cases also by refocusing efforts of the consolidating institutions themselves.","['Allen N Berger', 'Anthony Saunders', 'Joseph M Scalise', 'Gregory F Udell']","['Bank', 'Mergers', 'Small business']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000361,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,50,2
Macroeconomic news and bond market volatility1,"We examine the reaction of daily Treasury bond prices to the release of U.S. macroeconomic news. These news releases (of employment and producer price index data) are of interest because they are released on periodic, preannounced dates and because they are associated with substantial bond market volatility. We investigate whether these nonautocorrelated announcements give rise to autocorrelated volatility. We find that announcement-day volatility does not persist at all, consistent with the immediate incorporation of information into prices. We also find a risk premium on these release dates.","['Charles M. Jones', 'Owen Lamont', 'Robin L.

"Alternative factor specifications, security characteristics, and the cross-section of expected stock returns1","We examine the relation between stock returns, measures of risk, and several non-risk security characteristics, including the book-to-market ratio, firm size, the stock price, the dividend yield, and lagged returns. Our primary objective is to determine whether non-risk characteristics have marginal explanatory power relative to the arbitrage pricing theory benchmark, with factors determined using, in turn, the Connor and Korajczyk (CK; 1988) and the Fama and French (FF; 1993b) approaches. Fama–MacBeth-type regressions using risk adjusted returns provide evidence of return momentum, size, and book-to-market effects, together with a significant and negative relation between returns and trading volume, even after accounting for the CK factors. When the analysis is repeated using the FF factors, we find that the size and book-to-market effects are attenuated, while the momentum and trading volume effects persist. In addition, Nasdaq stocks show significant underperformance after adjusting for risk using either method.","['Michael J.

Wealth creation versus wealth redistributions in pure stock-for-stock mergers1,"We examine wealth changes for all 1283 publicly traded debt and equity securities of firms involved in 260 pure stock-for-stock mergers from 1963 to 1996. We find no evidence that conglomerate stock-for-stock mergers create financial synergies or benefit bondholders at stockholders' expense. Instead, we document significant net synergistic gains in nonconglomerate mergers and generally insignificant net gains in conglomerate mergers. Conglomerate bidding-firm stockholders lose; all other securityholders at least break even. Convertible securityholders experience the largest gains, due mostly to their attached option values. Certain bond covenants are value-enhancing while leverage increases are value-reducing.","['Carlos P Maquieira', 'William L Megginson', 'Lance Nail']","['Conglomerate mergers', 'Stock-for-stock mergers', 'Bond valuation']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000026,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,48,1
"Information and volatility linkages in the stock, bond, and money markets1","We investigate the nature of volatility linkages in the stock, bond, and money markets. We develop a simple model of speculative trading that predicts strong volatility linkages in these markets due to common information, which simultaneously affects expectations across markets, and information spillover caused by cross-market hedging. To measure these linkages, we estimate a stochastic volatility representation of our trading model using GMM. The results indicate that our specification explains many of the observed characteristics of the data, and that the volatility linkages between the three markets are indeed strong. Moreover, we find that the linkages have become stronger since the 1987 stock market crash.","['Jeff Fleming', 'Chris Kirby', 'Barbara Ostdiek']","['Stochastic volatility', 'Common information', 'Information spillover', 'Market linkages']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000191,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,49,1
The cost of market versus regulatory discipline in banking1,"We present evidence that insured deposit financing shields banks from the full costs of market discipline. Moody's downgrades, indicators of increasing risk, are associated with negative abnormal equity returns that are increasing in the bank's reliance on insured deposits. Moreover, banks raise their use of insured deposits following increases in risk. These findings cast doubt on the ability of capital market participants to effectively discipline bank behavior within the current regulatory environment. More generally, our findings highlight the potential for regulation to undermine market discipline in regulated industries.","['Matthew T. Billett', 'Jon A. Garfinkel', ""Edward S.

Proxy contests and corporate change: implications for shareholder wealth1,"We study the shareholder wealth effects of 270 proxy contests for board seats in the 1979–1994 period. We find that proxy contests create value, with the bulk of the wealth gains stemming from firms that are acquired. Restricting analysis to firms listed on Compustat imparts a downward bias on estimated wealth effects because such a restriction excludes a sizable fraction of the firms acquired during the proxy contest. For firms that are not acquired, the occurrence of management turnover has a significant, positive effect on shareholder wealth because firms replacing management are more likely to restructure following the contest.","['J.Harold Mulherin', 'Annette B Poulsen']","['Proxy contests', 'Market for corporate control', 'Management Turnover', 'Corporate restructuring']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000469,Journal of Financial Economics,1998,47,3
Information-time option pricing: theory and empirical evidence1,"With a stochastic time change from calendar-time to information-time, we derive a parsimonious option pricing formula with stochastic volatility as a risk-neutral Poisson sum of Merton's (1973) prices over the option's information-time maturity domain. The formula contains two unobservable parameters, information arrival intensity and information-time asset volatility, with stochastic volatility induced by random information arrival. When the information arrival rate intensifies, the option price increases and vice-versa. We test the formula in pricing, hedging, and excess profits capture empirically using currency and the S&P 500 futures options transaction data.","['Carolyn W. Chang', 'Jack S.K.
