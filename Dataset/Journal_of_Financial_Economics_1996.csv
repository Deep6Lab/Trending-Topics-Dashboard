The market's response to recurring events the case of stock splits,A substantial body of literature suggests that stock splits convey information. In this paper we extend this literature by examining firms that split their stock at least twice during 1970–1988. We focus on firms with multiple splits to provide evidence on the market's use of previous split experience in interpreting a recurring event. Our major findings are that stock price responses to both stock splits and post-split earnings changes depend on earnings realizations observed after previous splits. These findings support the conclusion that the market uses previous split experience to interpret a recurring event.,"['Eugene Pilotte', 'Timothy Manuel']","['Stock splits', 'Price response', 'Earnings information']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500859D,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,41,1
Leasing and credit risk,"Despite empirical evidence pointing to a strong similarity between lease contracts and junk bonds, the theoretical modeling of equilibrium lease determination has been confined primarily to default-free leases. This paper provides a unified framework for determining the equilibrium credit spread on leases subject to default risk. The model is flexible enough to be applied to a wide variety of real-world leasing structures, including security deposits, required up-front prepayments, embedded lease options, leases indexed to use, and lease credit insurance contracts.",['Steven R.

Debt and the marginal tax rate,"Do taxes affect corporate debt policy? This paper tests whether the incremental use of debt is positively related to simulated firm-specific marginal tax rates that account for net operating losses, investment tax credits, and the alternative minimum tax. The simulated marginal tax rates exhibit substantial variation due to the dynamics of the tax code, tax regime shifts, business cycle effects, and the progressive nature of the statutory tax schedule. Using annual data from more than 10,000 firms for the years 1980–1992, I provide evidence which indicates that high-tax-rate firms issue more debt than their low-tax-rate counterparts.",['John R.

Dealer versus auction markets: A paired comparison of execution costs on NASDAQ and the NYSE,"Execution costs, as measured by the quoted spread, the effective spread (which accounts for trades inside the quotes), the realized spread (which measures revenues of suppliers of immediacy), the Roll (1984) implied spread, and the post-trade variability, are twice as large for a sample of NASDAQ stocks as they are for a matched sample of NYSE stocks. The difference is not due to differences in adverse information, in market depth, or in the frequency of even-eighth quotes. Partial explanations are provided by differences in the treatment of limit orders and commissions in the two markets. We conclude that important explanations are the internalization and preferencing of order flow and the presence of alternative interdealer trading systems, factors that limit dealers' incentives to narrow spreads on NASDAQ.","['Roger D.

A requiem for the USA Is small shareholder monitoring effective?,"From 1986 to 1993, the United Shareholders Association (USA) provided a conduit through which small shareholders could unite and attempt to influence the governance of large US corporations. We show that the USA targeted large firms that underperformed the market, that its influence increased from 1990 to 1993, and that USA-Sponsored proposals were more successful when the target firm was a poor performer with high institutional ownership. The announcement of 53 USA-negotiated agreements is associated with an average abnormal return of 0.9% or a total shareholder wealth gain of $1.3 billion, suggesting that USA-sponsored shareholder activism enhanced shareholder value.","['Deon Strickland', 'Kenneth W.

Grandstanding in the venture capital industry,"I develop and test the hypothesis that young venture capital firms take companies pubic earlier than older venture capital firms in order to establish a reputation and successfully raise capital for new funds. Evidence from a sample of 433 IPOs suggests that companies backed by young venture capital firms are younger and more underpriced at their IPO than those of established venture capital firms. Moreover, young venture capital firms have been on the board of directors a shorter period of time at the IPO, hold smaller equity stakes, and time the IPO to precede or coincide with raising money for follow-on funds.",['Paul A.

The distorting effect of the prudent-man laws on institutional equity investments,"I examine the effect of prudent-man laws on the behavior of institutional investors. Variation in exposure to legal liability across types of investment managers allows me to disentangle the effect of the prudent-man laws from other potential influences on manager behavior. Bank managers significantly tilt the composition of their portfolios toward stocks that are viewed by the courts as prudent, while mutual fund managers choose not. I show that differences in the direction that bank and mutual fund managers choose to tilt may explain their portfolio performance differences over time.",['Diane Del Guercio'],"['Institutional investors', 'Prudent-man regulations', 'Portfolio tilting', 'Portfolio performance']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X95008412,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,40,1
Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors,"I present evidence consistent with theories that small boards of directors are more effective. Using Tobin's Q as an approximation of market valuation, I find an inverse association between board size and firm value in a sample of 452 large U.S. industrial corporations between 1984 and 1991. The result is robust to numerous controls for company size, industry membership, inside stock ownership, growth opportunities, and alternative corporate governance structures. Companies with small boards also exhibit more favorable values for financial ratios, and provide stronger CEO performance incentives from compensation and the threat of dismissal.",['David Yermack'],"['Boards of directors', 'Corporate governance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X95008445,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,40,2
The influence of professional investors on the failure of management buyout attempts,"In a sample of 111 MBO offers between 1984 and 1987, almost 30% attract new blockholders. These blockholders are primarily professional investors who act to facilitate a takeover by a higher bidder, thus increasing returns to both themselves and other public shareholders. In contrast, I find little evidence that pre-existing blockholders, particularly institutional holders, affect either the offer outcome or actively participate in the buyout contest once it begins. The overall pattern of results suggests that professional investors, particularly equity-holding companies, are ‘control specialists’ who provide valuable services as brokers in the market for corporate control.",['Sarah W.

Perceptions and the politics of finance: Junk bonds and the regulatory seizure of first capital life,"In May 1991, one month after seizing Executive Life, California regulators seized First Capital Life (FCLIC). Both insurers were Drexel clients with large junk bond holdings, and both had experienced ‘bank runs’. FCLIC's run followed regulators' televised comments that its poor condition necessitated a substantial cash infusion. Yet FCLIC's statutory capital — with junk bonds, real estate, and mortgages marked to market — was far from lowest among major insurers with California policyholders. It becomes lowest if junk bonds alone are marked to market at year-end 1990 (ignoring larger market declines in real estate/mortgages and the junk bond market's 21% return in early 1991). Our findings suggest a regulatory bias against junk bonds in the political backlash against the 1980s.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Stuart C.

Market microstructure and asset pricing: On the compensation for illiquidity in stock returns,"Models of price formation in securities markets suggest that privately informed investors create significant illiquidity costs for uninformed investors, implying that the required rates of return should be higher for securities that are relatively illiquid. We investigate the empirical relation between monthly stock returns and measures of illiquity obtained from intraday data. We find a significant relation between required rates of return and these measures after adjusting for the Fama and French risk factors, and also after accounting for the effects of the stock price level.","['Michael J.

A generalized model for testing the home and favorite team advantage in point spread markets,"Most sports teams play as either the favorite or the underdog and either at home or away. The failure to recognize the symmetric and interdependent relations between these characteristics has led previous researchers to use potentially biased methods to test for rationality and efficiency in football betting markets and thus to reach inappropriate conclusions. We develop a more general specification, which also incorporates ‘pick-em’ games and games played on neutral sites, and find little or no evidence against market efficiency in the NFL and college betting markets for regular season games. We do, however, uncover evidence of biased betting lines for Superbowls.","['William H.

Why Nasdaq market makers avoid odd-eighth quotes,"Recent studies argue that implicit collusion explains the tendency of Nasdaq market makers to avoid odd-eighth price quotes. This paper focuses on the role that preference trading plays in determining quoted spreads. Under the postulated effects of preference trading, an analysis of the relation between spreads and price fractions explains the paucity of odd-eighth quotes on Nasdaq. Empirical results from a comprehensive data set show that exogenous economic characteristics explain the distribution of price fractions across securities, and illustrate the stability of that distribution over time. These results contradict empirical results offered as support for the collusion hypothesis.",['Paul E.

Corporate governance and shareholder initiatives: Empirical evidence,"Shareholder-initiated proxy proposals on corporate governance issues became popular in the late 1980s as corporate takeover activity declined. We find firms attracting governance proposals have poor prior performance, as measured by the market-to-book ratio, operating return, and sales growth. There is little evidence that operating returns improve after proposals. The proposals also have negligible effects on company share values and top management turnover. Even proposals that receive a majority of shareholder votes typically do not engender share price increases or discernible changes in firm policies.","['Jonathan M. Karpoff', 'Paul H.

Stock splits: Signaling or liquidity? The case of ADR ‘solo-splits’,"Stock splits should have no effect on firm value in perfect capital markets, yet stock prices increase on split announcements. The two traditional explanations are information signaling and improved liquidity for shares that trade at lower prices. We investigate these explanations by studying splits of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that are not associated with splits in their home-country stock, and which represent unique illustrations of the effect of liquidity. We interpret our findings as supportive of the liquidity explanation of stock split announcement effects.","['Chris J. Muscarella', 'Michael R.

Modeling the conditional distribution of interest rates as a regime-switching process,This paper develops a generalized regime-switching (GRS) model of the short-term interest rate. The model allows the short rate to exhibit both mean reversion and conditional heteroskedasticity and nests the popular generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and square root process specifications. The conditional variance process accommodates volatility clustering and dependence on the level of the interest rate. A first-order Markov process with state-dependent transition probabilities governs the switching between regimes. The GRS model is compared with various existing models of the short rate in terms of (1) the statistical fit of short-term interest rate data and (2) out-of-sample forecasting performance.,['Stephen F.

Firm-specific information and the correlation between individual stocks and bonds,"This paper examines the correlation between the returns on individual stocks and the yield changes of individual bonds issued by the same firm, and finds that they are negatively and contemporaneously correlated. This suggests that individual stocks and bonds are driven by firm-specific information that is predominantly related to the mean, rather than the variance, of the firm's underlying assets. Furthermore, I find that lagged stock returns have explanatory power for current bond yield changes, while current stock returns are unrelated to lagged bond yield changes. This shows that stocks lead bonds in reflecting firm-specific information.",['Simon H.

Hostile takeovers and the correction of managerial failure,"This paper examines the disciplining function of hostile takeovers in the U.K. in 1985 and 1986. We report evidence of high board turnover and significant levels of post-takeover restructuring. Large gains are anticipated in hostile bids as reflected in high bid premiums. However, there is little evidence of poor performance prior to bids, suggesting that the high board turnover does not derive from past managerial failure. Hostile takeovers do not therefore perform a disciplining function. Instead, rejection of bids appears to derive from opposition to post-takeover redeployment of assets and renegotiation over the terms of bids.","['Julian Franks', 'Colin Mayer']","['Hostile takeovers', 'Executive dismissals']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500840B,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,40,1
Top management turnover an empirical investigation of mutual fund managers,"This paper examines the relation between the replacement of mutual fund managers and their prior performance. Using the growth rate in a fund's asset base and its portfolio returns as two separate measures of performance, I document an inverse relation between the probability of managerial replacement and fund performance. The sample of departing fund managers exhibits higher portfolio turnover rates and higher expenses relative to an objective-matched sample of nonreplaced fund managers. The overall evidence is consistent with the presence of well-functioning internal and external market mechanisms for mutual fund managers.",['Ajay Khorana'],"['Management turnover', 'Mutual funds', 'Control mechanisms', 'Governance structure']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X95008526,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,40,3
Proxies for the corporate marginal tax rate,"This paper focuses on how best to measure the corporate marginal tax rate, which is an important input into financial analysis of the cost of capital, financing policy, corporate hedging, and corporate reorganizations. The results indicate that the simulated tax rate used by Shevlin (1990) and Graham (1996), although difficult to calculate, is the best available proxy for the ‘true’ marginal tax rate. If the simulated rate is unavailable, an easy-to-calculate trichotomous variable or the statutory marginal tax rate (which captures the progressivity in the tax schedule) are reasonable alternatives, better than most commonly used tax variables.",['John R.

Order characteristics and stock price evolution An application to program trading,"This paper is an econometric analysis of the information content of automated orders arriving at the NYSE. The model captures the joint behavior of automated orders and also the return on the stock index future and the futures-spot basis. The results indicate that orders contain information useful in predicting stock returns beyond the information contained in the reported trades. Furthermore, program and index-arbitrage orders contain information beyond that available from the futures return and basis, suggesting that these orders are not merely passive conveyors of common-factor information. Nonprogram, program, and index-arbitrage orders have roughly similar price impacts.",['Joel Hasbrouck'],"['Market microstructure', 'Program trading', 'Index arbitrage', 'Equity trading', 'Market making']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500858C,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,41,1
The term structure of interest rates in a pure exchange economy with heterogeneous investors,This paper presents an equilibrium model of the term structure of interest rates when investors have heterogeneous preferences. The basic model considers a pure exchange economy of two classes of investors with different (but constant) relative risk aversion and gives closed-form solutions to bond prices. I use the model to examine the effect of preference heterogeneity on the behavior of bond yields. The model is also extended to cases of more than two classes of investors.,['Jiang Wang'],"['Asset pricing', 'Interest rates', 'Term structure', 'Preferences heterogeneity']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X95008548,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,41,1
The structure of mutual fund charges,"This paper provides an explanation for the diversity in investment strategies and fees of open-end mutual funds. Mutual funds seek to dissuade redemptions through front- and back-end load fees. The empirical evidence is consistent with model predictions that such fees dissuade redemptions in open-end funds, and that funds hold more cash when there is uncertainty about redemptions. Furthermore, funds with load and redemption fees hold less cash that their no-load counterparts. The results suggest that aggressive funds are sensitive to cash flows and are likely to rely on fees to dissuade redemptions.",['Tarun Chordia'],"['Mutual fund fees', 'Risk sharing']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500856A,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,41,1
"Time-varying risk premia, volatility, and technical trading rule profits: Evidence from foreign currency futures markets",This paper re-examines the efficiency of foreign currency futures markets by evaluating the role of time-varying risk premia and volatility in explaining technical trading rule profits. The results show that large parts of the technical rule profits can be explained by the time-varying risk premia estimated from a general model for the conditional CAPM; The bootstrap distributions for the profits under the null model average one-third to one-half of the actual profits and enclose the actual profits well within the 90% confidence intervals. Time-varying conditional volatility explains an additional 10% of the profits.,['Bong-Chan Kho'],"['Technical analysis', 'Time-varying risk premium', 'CAPM', 'GARCH-M model']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X95008618,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,41,2
Markup pricing in mergers and acquisitions,"This paper studies the relation between the premiums in takeover bids involving exchange-listed target firms from 1975-91 and the pre-announcement stock price runups. The evidence shows that the pre-bid runup and the post-announcement increase in the target's stock price (the ‘markup’) are generally uncorrelated. With little substitution between the runup and the markup, the runup is an added cost to the bidder. This finding has important implications for assessing the costs of insider trading. It also raises interesting questions about the role of information from public capital markets in private takeover negotiations.",['G.William Schwert'],"['Auctions', 'Insider trading', 'Takeovers', 'Premiums']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500865C,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,41,2
Detecting abnormal operating performance: The empirical power and specification of test statistics,"This research evaluates methods used in event studies that employ accounting-based measures of operating performance. We examine the choice of an accounting-based performance measure, a statistical test, and a model of expected operating performance. We document the impact of these choices on the test statistics designed to detect abnormal operating performance. We find that commonly used research designs yield test statistics that are misspecified in cases where sample firms have performed either unusually well or poorly. In this sampling situation, the test statistics are only well specified when sample firms are matched to control firms of similar pre-event performance.","['Brad M. Barber', 'John D.

Price stabilization as a bonding mechanism in new equity issues,Underwriters have an incentive to overstate investor interest in order to persuade some investors to purchase shares at a price in excess of their initial estimate of the fair value. We show that this incentive is eliminated when the underwriter commits to secondary market price stabilization. Destroying the underwriter's incentive to overstate interest reduces the total surplus captured by initial investors in initial public offerings. Further efficiency gains are associated with penalty bid systems that permit the underwriter to make the stabilization commitment selectively. Price stabilization can thus be viewed as a bonding mechanism that improves the efficiency of the primary equity market.,"['Lawrence M. Benveniste', 'Walid Y. Busaba', 'William J.

Market timing ability and volatility implied in investment newsletters' asset allocation recommendations,"We analyze the advice contained in a sample of 237 investment newsletter strategies over 1980-1992.

"Ownership dispersion, costly information, and IPO underpricing","We develop an explanation for IPO underpricing in which the issuer's demand for ownership dispersion creates an incentive to underprice. Promoting oversubscription allows broad initial ownership, which in turn increases secondary-market liquidity. Increased liquidity reduces the required return to investors. Broad initial ownership, however, requires an increase in investor-borne information costs. These information costs are offset through initial underpricing. Empirical results are consistent with initial underpricing reflecting the level of ownership dispersion.","['James R.

The financial performance of reverse leveraged buyouts,"We examine the accounting and market performance of reverse leveraged buyouts (i.e., firms making their first public offering after previously completing a leveraged buyout). On average, the accounting performance of these firms is significantly better than their industries at the time of the initial public offering (IPO) and for at least the following four years, though there is some evidence of a decline in performance. Cross-sectional variation in accounting performance subsequent to the IPO is related to changes in the equity ownership of both operating management and other insiders, and is unrelated to changes in leverage. Finally, there is no evidence of abnormal common stock performance after the reverse leveraged buyout.","['Robert W. Holthausen', 'David F.

Exchange rate variability and the riskiness of U.S. multinational firms: Evidence from the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system,"We examine the relation between exchange rate variability and stock return volatility for U.S. multinational firms and decompose this relation into components of systematic and diversifiable risk. Focusing on two five-year periods around the 1973 switch from fixed to floating exchange rates, we find a significant increase in volatility of monthly stock returns corresponding to the period of increased exchange rate variability, even relative to the increase in stock return volatility for three control samples.

Commonality in the determinants of expected stock returns,"We find that the determinants of the cross-section of expected stock returns are stable in their identity and influence from period to period and from country to country. Out-of-sample predictions of expected return are strongly and consistently accurate. Two findings distinguish this paper from others in the contemporary literature: First, stocks with higher expected and realized rates of return are unambiguously lower in risk than stocks with lower returns. Second, the important determinants of expected stock returns are strikingly common to the major equity markets of the world. Overall, the results seem to reveal a major failure in the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.","['Robert A. Haugen', 'Nardin L.

Factors affecting the number of outside directorships held by CEOs,"We investigate factors affecting the number of outside directorships held by CEOs. CEOs of firms with growth opportunities hold fewer outside directorships than CEOs of firms consisting primarily of assets-in-place. We find evidence consistent with CEOs holding more outside directorships as they transfer decision rights to their eventual successors. We also find that when employees (not necessarily CEOs) of two different firms sit on each other's boards, CEOs hold more outside directorships, suggesting CEO participation bonds the relationship between the two firms.

Investor valuation of the abandonment option,"We investigate whether investors price the option to abandon a firm at its exit value. Theory prices this real option as an American put with both a stochastic strike price (exit value) and a stochastic value of the underlying security (the value of cash flows). The empirical implications are that firm value increases in exit value, after controlling for expected going-concern cash flows, and that more generalizable assets produce more abandonment option value. Using discounted earnings forecasts to proxy for expected cash flows and prior literature to categorize asset generalizability, we find strong support for the predictions of abandonment option theory.","['Philip G.

An empirical analysis of strategic competition and firm values the case of R&D competition,"We operationalize a firm's competitive strategy through a new empirical measure, and develop a framework for empirical analysis of the market value of strategic behavior. Using this framework, we study announcement effects of R&D spending. The announcing firm's stock prices are positively influenced by a change in spending, and negatively by our competitive strategy measure (CSM). Competitors' stock prices are positively influenced by the interaction between the market's reaction to the announcing firm and the CSM.

The pricing of convertible debt offerings,"We present the first empirical evidence on the pricing of convertible debt offerings. Using a sample of 91 convertible debt offerings from the period 1988–1992, we show a significant mean initial excess return of 1.11%. Our underpricing result is invariant to zero/nonzero coupons, maturity, issue size, or bond ratings. Further analysis reveals that various types of risk inherent in the new convertible issues are useful in explaining the cross-sectional variation in the initial excess returns. We offer an explanation for our results based on the arguments of the differential information model.","['Jun-Koo Kang', 'Yul W.

An empirical analysis of prepackaged bankruptcies,"We provide comprehensive data on the attributes and outcomes of the restructuring process for a sample of 49 financially distressed firms that restructured by means a prepackaged bankruptcy. Our findings complement previous research on out-of-court restructurings and traditional Chapter 11 filings. By most measures, including the time spent in reorganization, the direct fees as a percent of pre-distress assets, the recovery rates by creditors, and the incidence of violation of absolute priority of claimholders, we find that prepacks lie between out-of-court restructurings and traditional Chapter 11 bankruptcies.","['Elizabeth Tashjian', 'Ronald C.

Active investors and management turnover following unsuccessful control contests,"We report that 34% of targets of unsuccessful control contents between 1983 and 1989 experience a change in top manager within two years following the contest. Management turnover is concentrated among poorly performing firms in which outside blockholders acquire an ownership stake. These blockholders appear to facilitate post-contest asset restructurings that increase the value of the target and improve operating performance. In the absence of an outsider blockholder, managers typically retain their positions despite poor pre-contest performance and the use of value-reducing defensive tactics during the control contest. We conclude that monitoring by active outside investors facilitates valuable internal control efforts.","['David J. Denis', 'Jan M.

"Leverage, investment, and firm growth","We show that there is a negative relation between leverage and future growth at the firm level and, for diversified firms, at the business segment level. This negative relation between leverage and growth holds for firms with low Tobin's q ratio, but not for high-q firms or firms in high-q industries. Therefore, leverage does not reduce growth for firms known to have good investment opportunities, but is negatively related to growth for firms whose growth opportunities are either not recognized by the capital markets or are not sufficiently valuable to overcome the effects of their debt overhang.","['Larry Lang', 'Eli Ofek', 'RenéM.

The impact of industry shocks on takeover and restructuring activity,"We study industry-level patterns in takeover and restructuring activity during the 1982–1989 period. Across 51 industries, we find significant differences in both the rate and time-series clustering of these activities. The interindustry patterns in the rate of takeovers and restructurings are directly related to the economic shocks borne by the sample industries. These results support the argument that much of the takeover activity during the 1980s was driven by broad fundamental factors and have general implications for the stock price spillover effects of takeover announcements, corporate performance following takeovers, and the timing of takeover waves.","['Mark L.

Reversal of fortune dividend signaling and the disappearance of sustained earnings growth,"We study the signaling content of managers' dividend decisions for 145 NYSE firms whose annual earnings decline after nine or more consecutive years of growth. Using a variety of model specifications and definitions of favorable dividend signals, we find virtually no support for the notion that dividend decisions help identify firms with superior future earnings. Dividends tend not to be reliable signals because (i) a behavioral bias (overoptimism) leads managers to overestimate future earnings when growth prospects fade; and (ii) managers make only modest cash commitments when they increase dividends, undermining the reliability of such signals.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Douglas J.

Is there a pecking order? Evidence from a panel of IPO firms,"We test the pecking order model of capital structure by examining the financing of firms that went public in 1983. We estimate a logit to predict external financing, and a multinomial logit to predict the type of financing using data on the IPO firms' security offerings during 1984–1992. Our results indicate that the probability of obtaining external funds is unrelated to the shortfall in internally generated funds, although firms with cash surpluses avoid external financing. Firms that access the capital markets do not follow the pecking order when choosing the type of security to offer.","['Jean Helwege', 'Nellie Liang']","['Pecking order', 'External financing', 'IPOs']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X95008515,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,40,3
Discriminatory versus uniform treasury auctions: Evidence from when-issued transactions,"We use when-issued transactions data to assess the Treasury's current experiment with uniform auctions. When-issued volume is higher under uniform as compared to discriminatory auctions, suggesting a higher information release, which should reduce pre-auction uncertainty and the winner's curse. Under uniform auctions, when-issued volatility falls after the auction and again after the outcome announcement. The pattern is the opposite for discriminatory auctions. This is further evidence that uniform auctions increase pre-auction information and lower the short squeeze. A direct comparison of markups in uniform and discriminatory auctions yields mixed results.","['Kjell G.

Commercial banks in investment banking conflict of interest or certification role?,"When commercial banks make loans to firms and also underwrite securities, does this hamper or enhance their role as certifiers of firm value? This paper examines empirically the pricing of bank-underwritten securities as compared to investment-house-underwritten securities over a unique period in the U.S. (pre-Glass-Steagall) when both banks and investment houses were allowed to underwrite securities. The evidence shows that investors were willing to pay higher prices for securities underwritten by banks rather than investment houses. The results support a certification role for banks, which is more valuable for junior and information sensitive securities.",['Manju Puri'],"['Glass-Steagall', 'Banks', 'Certification', 'Conflict of interest', 'Security pricing']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X95008559,Journal of Financial Economics,1996,40,3
