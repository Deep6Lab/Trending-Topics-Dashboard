The valuation of floating-rate instruments,"A framework for valuing floating-rate notes is developed to examine the effects of (1) lags in the coupon formula, (2) special contractual features and (3) default risk. Evidence from a sample of floaters indicates they sold at significant discounts. While lags in the coupon formulas and other contractual features make these notes more variable, they do not account for the magnitude of the discounts. We conclude that the fixed default premium in the coupon formula of a typical note is inadequate to compensate for time-varying default premiums demanded by investors, who treat other corporate short-term paper as close substitutes.","['Krishna Ramaswamy', 'Suresh M.

Statistical tests of contingent-claims asset-pricing models,"A new methodology for statistically testing contingent-claims asset-pricing models based on asymptotic statistical theory is proposed. It is introduced in the context of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, for which some illustrative estimation, inference, and simulation results are also presented. The proposed methodology is then extended to arbitrary contingent claims by first considering the estimation problem for general Itô processes and then deriving the asymptotic distribution of a general contingent claim which depends upon such Itô processes.",['Andrew W.

Valuing debt options,"A two-factor model using the instantaneous rate of interest and the return on a consol bond to describe the term structure of interest rates — the Brennan-Schwartz model — is used to derive theoretical prices for American call and put options on US government bonds and treasury bills. These model prices are then compared with market prices. The theoretical model used to value the dept options also provides hedge ratios which may be used to construct zero-investment portfolios which, in theory, are perfectly riskless. Several trading strategies based on these ‘riskless’ portfolios are examined.","['Bruce Dietrich-Campbell', 'Eduardo Schwartz']",[],[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X86900334,Journal of Financial Economics,1986,16,3
Corporate mergers and security returns,"An examination of rates of return and dollar value returns for various classes of merging firms' securities indicates that acquired companies' common stockholders, convertible and non-convertible preferred stockholders, and convertible bondholders gain in merger, as do acquiring companies' convertible preferred stockholders. Acquired companies' non-convertible bondholders and acquiring companies' convertible and non-convertible bondholders and non-convertible preferred stockholders neither gain nor lose. There is no evidence that acquiring companies' common stockholders lose and there is statistically reliable evidence that they gain. Additionally, the dollar value of both acquired and acquiring firms increase, as does the dollar value of the combined acquired and acquiring companies.","['Debra K. Dennis', 'John J.

Stock return variances,"Asset prices are much more volatile during exchange trading hours than during non-trading hours. This paper considers three explanations for this phenomenon: (1) volatility is caused by public information which is more likely to arrive during normal business hours; (2) volatility is caused by private information which affects prices when informed investors trade; and (3) volatility is caused by pricing errors that occur during trading. Although a significant fraction of the daily variance is caused by mispricing, the behavior of returns around exchange holidays suggests that private information is the principle factor behind high trading-time variances.","['Kenneth R.

Unanticipated inflation and the value of the firm,"Evidence presented here indicates that the relationship between stock returns and unexpected inflation differs systematically across firms. The differences are shown to be consistent with cross-sectional variation in firms' nominal contracts (monetary claims and depreciation tax shields). The differences are also partially explained by proxies for underlying firm characteristics that could create interaction between unexpected inflation and operating profitability. Finally, much if not most of the differences appear to arise because unexpected inflation is correlated with changes in expected aggregate real activity, the effects of which tend to vary across firms according to their systematic risk.",['Victor L.

Implicit delivery options and optimal delivery strategies for financial futures contracts,"Futures contract specification usually allow the short position some variation as to when, where, how much, and what is to be delivered. In this paper we derive the optimal delivery policy for the Treasury Bond futures contracts, and find that our policy produces profits that are positive and statistically significant. This indicates that future prices are ‘too high’ in that the short position can earn profits by skillfully exercising his delivery options. We find the actual delivery policies of market participants depart substantially from the optimal strategy. The implications of these findings for futures traders and bond dealers are discussed.","['Gerald D.

Predicting returns in the stock and bond markets,"Several predetermined variables that reflect levels of bond and stock prices appear to predict returns on common stocks of firms of various sizes, long-term bonds of various default risks, and default-free bonds of various maturities. The returns on small-firm stocks and low-grade bonds are more highly correlated in January than in the rest of the year with previous levels of asset prices, especially prices of small-firm stocks. Seasonality is found in several conditional risk measures, but such seasonality is unlikely to explain, and in some cases is opposite to, the seasonal found in mean returns.","['Donald B.

The effect of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 on small business loan pricing,"The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 contains several provisions that can affect the cost of producing loans for financial intermediaries.

Unbiased estimation of the Black/Scholes formula,"The Black/Scholes model gives the price of an option as a function of the true variance rate of the underlying stock and other parameters. Because the true variance rate is unobservable, an estimate of the variance rate is used in empirical tests. But, because the Black/Scholes formula is non-linear in the variance, option price estimates using an estimated variance are biased, even if the variance estimate itself is unbiased. This paper develops an unbiased estimator of the Black/Scholes formula from a Taylor series expansion of the formula and the properties of the pdf of the estimated variance.","['J.S.

The effect of bond rating changes on common stock prices,"The evidence in this paper suggests that downgrades by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's are associated with negative abnormal stock returns in the two-day window beginning the day of the press release by the rating agency. Significant negative abnormal performance can still be detected after eliminating observations containing obvious concurrent (potentially contaminating) news releases. There is little evidence of abnormal performance on announcement of an upgrade. Significant abnormal returns are associated with announcements of additions to the Standard and Poor's Credit Watch List, if either a potential downgrade or a potential upgrade is indicated.","['Robert W.

A theory of price limits in futures markets,"The existence of price limits in certain futures markets is explained by demonstrating that price limits may act as a partial substitute for margin requirements in ensuring contract performance. Their effectiveness is a decreasing function of the amount of information available to traders about the equilibrium futures price which is unobservable in the event of a limit move, and the theory predicts that no limits will exist in the markets for financial futures.

General equilibrium properties of the term structure of interest rates,"The paper examines the allocation of consumption and investment in a three-date binomial model in order to determine the sign of the real term structure premium in general equilibrium. When production functions are concave, markets are complete, and future production possibilities are the same irrespective of which state of the world occurs, the term structure premium will be positive. In incomplete markets, constant or increasing absolute risk aversion is sufficient to guarantee a positive term structure premium, although in the (more likely) case of decreasing absolute risk aversion a negative premium cannot be ruled out.","['Simon Benninga', 'Aris Protopapadakis']",[],[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8690036X,Journal of Financial Economics,1986,16,3
Modeling the term structure of interest rates under non-separable utility and durability of goods,"The term structure relations implied by a model in which preferences are non-separable functions of the service flows from two goods are investigated. The parameters characterizing preferences are estimated and restrictions on the co-movements of consumptions and Treasury bill returns are examined. Both the durability of goods and the non-separability of preferences are important factors in explaining the time paths of individual returns, but there is substantial evidence against the cross-sectional restrictions implied by our model. Differences between sample mean returns are too large relative to the sample covariances of the return differences and the marginal utility of consumption.","['Kenneth B. Dunn', 'Kenneth J.

Term premiums and default premiums in money markets,"There are time-varying term and default premiums in the expected returns on money market securities. Default premiums decline with maturity and tend to be higher during recessions. Term premiums tend to increase with maturity during good times, but humps and inversions in the term structure of expected returns are common during recessions. Treasury bills produce positive average term premiums for the overall sample, but average term premiums for private-issuer securities are close to 0.0. A general conclusion is that variation in forward rates is primarily variation in current epected returns rather than in forecasts of changes in interest rates.",['Eugene F.

"Access to deposit insurance, insolvency rules and the stock returns of financial institutions",This paper analyzes how access to deposit insurance affects the common stock returns of financial institutions during periods of financial distress. During periods of distress the definition of insolvency used by insuring agencies may be modified to avoid a substantial number of bank failures. These modifications can increase the value of future deposit guarantees and affect the behavior of stock returns of banks and S&Ls. This hypothesis is examined using S&L data for the 1976 through 1983 period. Modification of insolvency rules applied to S&Ls appears to have reduced significantly the co-movement of S&L stock returns with S&L portfolio holdings.,"['James A. Brickley', 'Christopher M.

Valuation effects of corporate debt offerings,"This paper analyzes the effect of corporate debt offerings on stock prices. Straight debt offerings have non-positive price effects, while convertible debt offerings have significantly negative effects. Public utility mortgage (non-convertible) bond offerings have marginally negative effects, and the effect is significantly negative when the proceeds are used to finance the utility's investment program. Cross-sectional regressions reveal no relation between offer-induced price effects and offering size, rating, post-offer changes in abnormal earnings or debt-related tax shields. The evidence is inconsistent with theories predicting that the price effects of capital structure changes go in the direction of the leverage change.",['B.Espen Eckbo'],[],[],January–February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X86900528,Journal of Financial Economics,1986,15,1
The informational content of the timing of dividend announcements,"This paper contains a test of a new aspect of the informational content of dividend; namely, is there information in the timing of the announcements? The empirical evidence indicates that the market expects ‘bad news’ to be delivered late and that these expectations are confirmed. Mean excess returns of stock prices around late announcements are, depending on the assumed returns generating process, either significantly negative or insignificant while significantly positive around the entire population of announcements. Moreover, the proportion and magnitude of dividend reductions associated with late announcements are significantly larger than in the complete universe of announcements.","['Avner Kalay', 'Uri Loewenstein']",[],[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X86900358,Journal of Financial Economics,1986,16,3
Performance measurement with the arbitrage pricing theory,"This paper develops a theory and econometric method of portfolio performance measurement using a competitive equilibrium version of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory.

"Capital raising, underwriting and the certification hypothesis","This paper develops a theory of the role of the underwriter in certifying that risky issue prices reflect potentially adverse inside information. The theory derives from the literature on the use of reputational capital to guarantee product quality. An underwriting cost/benefit paradigm is employed to generate testable implications related to announcement effects, issue underpricing, the choice of competitive versus negotiated underwriting, and the level of underwriter compensation as a function of firm-specific information. Existing empirical literature is reviewed in the context of the certification hypothesis and several new tests are conducted. All of the findings are supportive of the hypothesis.","['James R.

"Investment banking, reputation, and the underpricing of initial public offerings","This paper develops and tests two propositions. We demonstrate that there is a monotone relation between the (expected) underpricing of an initial public offering and the uncertainty of investors regarding its value. We also argue that the resulting underpricing equilibrium is enforced by investment bankers, who have reputation capital at stake. An investment banker who ‘cheats’ on this underpricing equilibrium will lose either potential investors (if it doesn't underprice enough) or issuers (if it underprices too much), and thus forfeit the value of its reputation capital. Empirical evidence supports our propositions.","['Randolph P. Beatty', 'Jay R.

The puzzling price behavior of treasury bills that mature at the turn of calendar months,"This paper documents the unusual price behavior of Treasury bills that mature at the turn of calendar months. There is a kink in the yield curve as it crosses calendar months, and this kink is most pronounced as the yield curve crosses between calendar years. Potential seasonality in the spot rate of interest could not explain these results, nor could they be explained by the ‘mispricing’ of either the last bill or first bill in a month. The exceptionally large premium on the first bill in a month tended to be earned throughout the lifetime of the bill.","['Sang Yong Park', 'Marc R.

Instead, while these shocks affect all individuals ex ante, they are concentrated among a few ex post. The equity premium in general depends on the concentration of these aggregate shocks; it follows that one cannot estimate the degree of risk aversion from aggregate data alone.

An empirical investigation of calls of non-convertible bonds,"This paper examines call behavior of corporate issuers of non-convertible bonds. Evidence from a sample of 102 calls indicates that the market value of the called bonds is usually below the call price at the time of the announcement. The stock price reactions to call announcements are positively related to the direction of the change in leverage. When the call relaxes restrictive covenants, the firm on average pays a larger premium to call debt. The premium is a minimum estimate of the potential opportunity costs of restrictive covenants.",['Joseph D.

For taxable distributions (cash dividends), it is found that trading volume increases significantly around the ex-dividend day. This increase is more pronounced for high yield, actively traded stocks and after brokerage commissions became negotiable. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that short-term traders have an impact on ex-day price behavior, at least for taxable distributions.

The argument depends upon the existence of a group of investors whose information is superior to that of the firm as well as that of all other investors. If the new shares are priced at their expected value, these priveleged investors crowd out the others when good issues are offered and they withdraw from the market when bad issues are offered.

Issuing costs to existing shareholders in competitive and negotiated underwritten public utility equity offerings,"This paper presents the results of an empirical investigation of whether there is any difference in the cost incurred by public utilities if they issue new equity through a negotiated or competitive underwriting. We conclude that the expected cost of a competitive offer is less than the expected cost of a negotiated offer, but that the variance of the cost is substantially greater with a competitive offer. These results are interesting because most public utilities use negotiated underwriting unless forced by regulation to use competitive offers. This paper is also an addition to the growing agency theory literature.","['Sanjai Bhagat', 'Peter A.

John Long's (1978) study of the two shares' relative prices suggests that investors may prefer cash dividends to equal-sized stock dividends. This paper finds that the cash dividend share's ex-day price decline is less than their dividend payment. Stock dividend shares fall by nearly their full dividend. The disparity between ex-day dividend valuation and the observed prices of the two shares is inconsistent with some explanations of the demand for cash dividends.",['James M Poterba'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X86900280,Journal of Financial Economics,1986,15,3

"Non-trading, market making, and estimates of stock price volatility","We examine the effects of market making and intermittent trading on estimates of stock price volatility. When observed price changes are correctly tied to a stock's true price dynamics, it is found that non-trading per se causes a loss of efficiency but no bias in traditional volatility estimates. Non-trading induces substancial inefficiency in the extreme value estimator of volatility which it biases downward. Market making's effects add to the non-trading induced inefficiency in the traditional estimator, while information trading causes a downward bias, and liquidity trading a potentially removable upward bias, in that estimator.","['Terry A.

A test of dividend irrelevance using volume reactions to a change in dividend policy,We investigate the implication of clientele theories that changes in dividend policy should result in a marked increase in trading volume as shareholder clienteles change. With 192 firms announcing their first cash dividend we document both an increase in trading volume and firm value around the announcement date. We integrate these results to distinguish between the volume response to good news about the future and clientele adjustments to a change in dividend policy. Our results suggest that volume increases primarily in response to the signal about future earnings contained in the dividend. Clientele adjustments are small.,"['Gordon Richardson', 'Stephan E.

A transaction data study of weekly and intradaily patterns in stock returns,"Weekly and intradaily patterns in common stock prices are examined using transaction data. For large firms, negative Monday close-to-close returns accrue between the Friday close and the Monday open; for smaller firms they accrue primarily during the Monday trading day. For all firms, significant weekday differences in intraday returns accrue during the first 45 minutes after the market opens. On Monday mornings, prices drop, while on the other weekday mornings, they rise. Otherwise the pattern of intraday returns is similar on all weekdays. Most notable is an increase in prices on the last trade of the day.",['Lawrence Harris'],[],[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X86900449,Journal of Financial Economics,1986,16,1
Empirical determinants of the relative yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities,"Yields on short-term prime-grade municipals vary through time in relation to after-corporate-tax yields on short-term U.S. Treasury securities. The pattern is not related to the default premium in municipal yields or to the historical ceiling on bank deposit rates (Regulation Q). However, there is a strong link to the default premium in corporate yields and to municipal holdings by large commercial banks. These findings suggest that taxable and tax-exempt markets are linked both by the capital-structure decisions of firms and by the tax-arbitrage activities of banks.","['Stephen A. Buser', 'Patrick J.
