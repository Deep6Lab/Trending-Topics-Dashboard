Underwritten calls of convertible bonds,"Common-stock prices fall a statistically significant 2 percent in response to underwritten convertible debt call announcements. We find that the significant negative price reaction is confined to underwritten calls — stock-price responses to non-underwritten calls average an insignificant −0.84 percent. The results support the idea that managers are more likely to use underwriters the more unfavorable the information they possess about future firm cash flows. An agency cost interpretation of underwritten calls is also consistent with the results, but is not supported by management ownership and corporate liquidity evidence.","['Ajai K. Singh', 'Arnold R.

The pricing of equity offerings,"Examination of 1,600 seasoned equity offerings reveals little evidence that underwriters systematically set offer prices below the market price on the major exchanges, though they may do so for NASDAQ issues. Quick round-trip transactions in seasoned offerings are not profitable, but subscribing to an offering and holding the stock for 30 days seems to be very profitable, especially in the NASDAQ market. In addition to seasoned offerings, we analyze 250 issues of new classes of preferred stock. These issues are not underpriced.","['Claudio F. Loderer', 'Dennis P. Sheehan', 'Gregory B.

Habit persistence and durability in aggregate consumption,"Habit persistence in preferences and durability of consumption goods both imply time-nonseparability in the derived utility for consumption expenditures. We study a simple model with both effects. Lagged consumption expenditures enter the Euler equation, where habit persistence implies that their coefficients are negative and durability implies positive coefficients. Estimating the sign of the coefficients addresses the question of which effect is dominant. Earlier empirical work on monthly data supports the durability of consumption expenditures. We find evidence in monthly, quarterly, and annual data that habit persistence dominates the effect of durability.","['Wayne E. Ferson', 'George M.

Market reaction to anticipated announcements,"In this paper we analyze how anticipating a forthcoming public announcement affects the market reaction to the announcement by altering investors' incentives to acquire private information. Specifically, we study price change, volume, and information asymmetry at the time of the announcement. We also investigate how information acquisition, information asymmetry, price, and volume are influenced by the quality of prior knowledge, the marginal cost of gathering information, the degree of risk tolerance, and noise. Finally, we compare market reactions to anticipated announcements of known precision with the response to announcements that are either unanticipated or of uncertain quality.","['Oliver Kim', 'Robert E.

Components of short-horizon individual security returns,"In this paper, we present a simple model which relates security returns to three components: an expected return, a bid-ask error, and white noise. The relative importance of the various components is empirically assessed, and the model's ability to explain the various time-series properties of individual security and portfolio returns is tested. Time-varying expected returns and bid-ask errors are found to explain substantial proportions (up to 24%) of the variance of security returns. We also reconcile the typically negative autocorrelation in security returns with the strong positive autocorrelation in portfolio returns.","['Jennifer Conrad', 'Gautam Kaul', 'M.

Event-study methodology under conditions of event-induced variance,"Many authors have identified the hazards of ignoring event-induced variance in event studies. To determine the practical extent of the problem, we simulate an event with stochastic effects. We find that when an event causes even minor increases in variance, the most commonly-used methods reject the null hypothesis of zero average abnormal return too frequently when it is true, although they are reasonably powerful when it is false. We demonstrate that a simple adjustment to the cross-sectional techniques produces appropriate rejection rates when the null is true and equally powerful tests when it is false.","['Ekkehart Boehmer', 'Jim Masumeci', 'Annette B.

The consumption of stockholders and nonstockholders,"Only one-fourth of U.S. families own stock. This paper examines whether the consumption of stockholders differs from the consumption of nonstockholders and, if so, whether these differences help explain the empirical failures of the consumption-based CAPM. Household panel data are used to construct time series on the consumption of each group. The results indicate that the consumption of stockholders is more volatile and more highly correlated with the excess return on the stock market. These differences help explain the size of the equity premium, although they do not fully resolve the equity premium puzzle.","['N.Gregory Mankiw', 'Stephen P.

Voting power in the proxy process,The likelihood that a firm will enact a management-sponsored antitakeover charter amendment depends on ownership structure. This implies that the adoption of antitakeover amendments may be anticipated. Then announcement returns provide a biased estimate of wealth effects. An estimator that corrects for the bias induced by anticipation indicates that the enactment of an antitakeover amendment is associated with a statistically significant decrease in shareholder wealth. The voting power of employee stock ownership plans and the chief executive officer plays a prominent role in determining whether a firm will adopt this type of takeover defense.,"['Sanjai Bhagat', 'Richard H.

Choosing the method of sale,"This paper analyzes the sale of Conrail (Consolidated Rail Corporation) and finds three problems: first, a contingent claim gave the seller (the U.S. Government) conflicting objectives; second, bidders in the auction valued Conrail differently and thus did not compete effectively; and third, Conrail's management had an information advantage over the seller and outside bidders. These three factors can be present in any corporate divestiture and will tend to decrease the seller's revenue. We discuss how different methods of sale (e.g., two-stage auctions and parallel secret negotiations) will counteract these problems to varying degrees, although we find no single ‘best’ method.","['Carliss Y.

Proxy voting and the SEC,"This paper analyzes the SEC's proxy regulations and assesses their effects on corporate governance. The proxy rules began in 1935 as a minimal series of disclosure requirements and a prohibition against fraud. By 1956, they imposed extensive and wide-ranging disclosure requirements on anyone wishing to communicate about voting issues and required that all such communications be cleared in advance — in essence, censored — by the SEC. I present evidence that since that time, the rules have significantly increased the costs of communication and coordinated action among shareholders. They have thus deterred shareholder initiatives and inhibited the development of a private market for information about voting issues.",['John Pound'],[],[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X91900033,Journal of Financial Economics,1991,29,2
Were Japanese stock prices too high?,"This paper asks whether market fundamentals can explain the recent run-up and decline of Japanese equity values and price-earnings ratios. Accounting differences explain about half of the long-run disparity between U.S. and Japanese P/Es. For example, if Japanese firms used U.S. accounting rules, the Japanese P/E ratio would have been 32.6, not 53.7, in 1989. Accounting differences cannot, however, explain the doubling of this ratio in 1986, nor its decline in 1990. Similarly, we are unable to isolate changes in required stock returns or growth expectations that are large enough to explain recent Japanese stock price movements.","['Kenneth R. French', 'James M.

A Bayesian model of intraday specialist pricing,"This paper develops and tests a model of intraday security price movements which incorporates the effects of both trading volume and unanticipated information. We estimate our model using transaction data from a NYSE specialist and find strong evidence of information asymmetry, although the inventory effect appears weak. The parameter estimates are used to compute the costs of trading, and we find that implicit bid-ask spreads were significantly higher in October 1987 than in the rest of that year. We also examine large-block versus smaller trades and buyer-initiated versus seller-initiated trades.","['Ananth Madhavan', 'Seymour Smidt']",[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9190039M,Journal of Financial Economics,1991,30,1
The staying power of leveraged buyouts,"This paper documents the organizational status over time of 183 large leveraged buyouts completed between 1979 and 1986. By August 1990, 62% of the LBOs are privately owned, 14% are independent public companies, and 24% are owned by other public companies. The percentage of LBOs returning to public ownership increases over time, with LBOs remaining private for a median time of 6.82 years. The majority of LBOs, therefore, are neither short-lived nor permanent. The moderate fraction of LBO assets owned by other companies implies that asset sales play a role, but are not the primary motivating force in LBO transactions.",['Steven N.

A multicountry comparison of term-structure forecasts at long horizons,"This paper extends previous work on the information in the U.S. term structure at longer maturities to Britain, West Germany, and Switzerland. We find strong evidence that the term structure does have significant ability to forecast changes in inflation, particularly at long maturities. On the other hand, the ability of the term structure to forecast changes in one-year interest rates is somewhat weaker; only at the very longest horizon (five years) is there significant forecasting ability for interest-rate changes.","['Philippe Jorion', 'Frederic Mishkin']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9190013A,Journal of Financial Economics,1991,29,1
The postmerger share-price performance of acquiring firms,"This paper investigates share-price performance following corporate takeovers. We use multifactor benchmarks from the portfolio evaluation literature that overcome some of the known mean-variance inefficiencies of more traditional single-factor benchmarks. Studying 399 U.S. takeovers consummated in the 1975–1984 period, we conclude that previous findings of poor performance afer takeover are likely due to benchmark errors rather than mispricing at the time of the takeover.","['Julian Franks', 'Robert Harris', 'Sheridan Titman']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9190014B,Journal of Financial Economics,1991,29,1
Opportunistic underinvestment in debt renegotiation and capital structure,"This paper models debt renegotiation as a bargaining game between debtholders and shareholder-oriented management, in which management credibly threatens to run down firm assets to force concessions from the creditors. Creditors anticipate this opportunistic behavior by management, creating an upper bound on debt capacity that is less than the value of the firm. If an advantage to debt is introduced, such as favorable tax treatment, an interior optimal capital structure obtains even in the absence of realized bankruptcy costs. Our model also explains variations in debt-equity ratios and the use of certain puzzling debt covenants.","['Yaacov Z. Bergman', 'Jeffrey L.

A unified method for pricing options on diffusion processes,"This paper presents a unified method for closed-form pricing of European options on assets with diffusion prices. The method uses linear and nonlinear time and scale changes to reduce complex diffusion processes to known processes, thereby generating option pricing formulas for new diffusion processes and unifying existing results. Applications include: systematically modelling the effects on option prices of time-dependent variability in the underlying asset price, valuing futures options and options on assets showing maturity-related or seasonal volatility, valuing options on new nonconstant elasticity-of-variance diffusion processes, and pricing generalized options.",['David H.

Small sample tests of portfolio efficiency,"This paper presents an eigenvalue test of the efficiency of a portfolio when there is no riskless asset, complementing the test of Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989). Besides optimal upper and lower bounds, an easily-implented numerical method is provided for computing the exact P-value. Our approach makes it possible to draw statistical inferences on the efficiency of a given portfolio both in the context of the zero-beta CAPM and with respect to other linear pricing models. As an application, using monthly data for every consecutive five-year period from 1926 to 1986, we reject the efficiency of the CRSP value-weighted index for most periods.",['Guofu Zhou'],[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9190041H,Journal of Financial Economics,1991,30,1
Union negotiations and corporate policy,"This paper studies managerial compensation, financial reporting, and dividend policies of the seven major domestic steel producers during requests for union concessions. Substantial layoffs, reported losses, and sacrifices by nonunion stakeholders buttressed managers' case for union concessions. From 1980 to 1988, sample firms reduced their work force by about 300,000 (almost two-thirds) and annual wage payments from $16.1 to $8.6 billion. Reported income is lower during union negotiations, controlling for cash flows, as is managerial pay, with average CEO salary plus bonus declining 18%. Dividend reductions and white-collar pay cuts are substantial, pervasive, and clustered during union negotiations.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo']",[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9190021B,Journal of Financial Economics,1991,30,1
The degree of inefficiency in the football betting market,"This paper tests the hypothesis that the football betting market is efficient. Our statistical tests are stronger than those in previous studies, and we examine both NFL and college data over a sample period of fifteen years. Our statistical tests detect two specific biases in the NFL market and an unspecified bias in the college market. We examine the year-to-year consistency and magnitudes of the biases and find that the NFL bias against home teams has been nearly eliminated, while the bias against underdogs has increased. Profitable exploitation of the biases depends upon transaction costs.","['Joseph Golec', 'Maurry Tamarkin']",[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9190034H,Journal of Financial Economics,1991,30,2
Tax options and the pricing of treasury bond triplets,"This study uses Treasury bond triplets, which consist of three different Treasury issues with a common maturity date, to investigate the theoretical and empirical influence of tax strategies on Treasury prices. The tax-option effect, which arises from the right to optimally realize gains and losses for tax purposes, is found to induce convexity in the relation among triplet bond prices, but the effect is too small to create an arbitrage opportunity. A previous study [Litzenberger and Rolfo (1984)] is shown to incorrectly isolate the tax-option effect and hence misstate some key result; a correction is provided.","['Bradford D. Jordan', 'Susan D.

A case study in the design of an optimal production sharing rule for a petroleum exploration venture,"To improve on the design of the production-sharing rule in a contract for exploration and development negotiated between a state-owned oil resources authority and a U.S. oil company, we use the Grossman and Hart (1983) principal-agent model. In the original contract, the company was granted a share of production as an incentive to maximize the net return to the authority. The optimal sharing rule we develop increases the expected return to the authority by 6% by improving the company's incentives to choose an optimal exploration program.","['Philip Hampson', 'John Parsons', 'Charles Blitzer']",[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9190022C,Journal of Financial Economics,1991,30,1
Monitoring an owner,"Turner Broadcasting illustrates how organizational mechanisms can be adapted to prevent a majority owner from imposing costs on minority shareholders through inept management or opportunistic behavior. These mechanisms involve issuing preferred stock with unusual features, concentrating its ownership among a small group of investors, allowing the new preferred shareholders to elect several directors, and requiring supramajority approval of major management decisions by a reconstituted board of directors. The alienability of the preferred stock is restricted to help insure that its ownership stays concentrated and in the hands of those with the specific knowledge and incentives to be effective monitors.","['Clifford G.

"Underwriter warrants, underwriter compensation, and the costs of going public","Warrants are sometimes granted to underwriters in initial public offerings as part of the compensation for their services. We examine the effects of underwriter warrants in a sample of firm commitment offerings from 1983 through 1987. These warrants represent a significant component of the compensation to the underwriter and are associated with greater total costs of going public. Warrants appear to provide a mechanism for circumventing otherwise binding regulatory constraints, allowing issuers to offer extra compensation to underwriters marketing especially risky offerings.","['Christopher B.

Corporate issues of foreign currency exchange warrants,We argue that hedging and risk management activities of modern corporations arise as a direct consequence of attempts to create shareholder wealth through financial innovation. We formalize this argument by examining in detail corporate issues of foreign currency exchange warrants. We then focus on one multiple issuer to demonstrate how the foreign exchange risk created by the sale of the warrants can be eliminated. The use of off-balance-sheet risk management techniques to lock in the benefits of selling overpriced securities raises questions about the information content of innovative corporate financing decisions.,"['Richard J.

A test of the free cash flow hypothesis,"We develop a measure of free cash flow using Tobin's q to distinguish between firms that have good investment opportunities and those that do not. In a sample of successful tender offers, bidder returns are significantly negatively related to cash flow for low q bidders but not for high q bidders; further, the relation between cash flow and bidder returns differs significantly for low q and high q bidders. This result holds for several cash flow measures suggested in the literature and also in multivariate regressions controlling for bidder and contest-specific characteristics.","['Larry H.P.

"Deregulation, contestability, and airline acquisitions","We test whether airline consolidations generate monopoly profits by examining returns to listed carriers around horizontal airline-acquisition bids and evaluating effects of industry concentration on share-price reactions. Under Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) regulation, returns to targets, bidders, and rival carriers are positive functions of changes in concentration implied by bids. Changes in concentration after deregulation have no positive effect on carrier returns. These results support Jordan's (1970, 1972) hypothesis that CAB activities fostered carrier collusion. There is no evidence of monopoly gains from carrier consolidations after deregulation.","['Myron B. Slovin', 'Marie E. Sushka', 'Carl D.
