The option to withdraw IPOs during the premarket: empirical analysis,"American IPOs are priced after a process of bookbuilding, during which issuers can withdraw at any time. We hypothesize that the option to withdraw reduces underpricing by strengthening the issuers’ bargaining power with respect to investors. Empirical analysis reveals that underpricing is lower when investor perception of an IPO's likelihood of withdrawal is higher. Withdrawing issuers are neither smaller nor less profitable than issuers completing their IPOs, and engage underwriters that are as reputable as those managing completed offerings. Withdrawal is correlated with leverage, intended use of proceeds, expected issue size, venture backing, revenues, NASDAQ returns, and IPO activity.","['Walid Y. Busaba', 'Lawrence M.

The information content of litigation participation securities: the case of CalFed Bancorp,"CalFed Bancorp is one of 126 S&Ls suing the U.S. government for breach of contract related to supervisory goodwill, a form of goodwill created by the acquisition of insolvent thrifts during the early 1980s. Before a determination of damages in its lawsuit, CalFed announced and issued a litigation participation security giving shareholders a proportional claim on recovered damages, if any. This announcement generated a positive excess return in part because it made CalFed a more likely acquisition target. Trading in the security also reveals important, yet previously unavailable, information about CalFed's lawsuit: its price reveals a market-based estimate of damages while its beta reveals information regarding expected returns and trial duration. In a broader context, this paper identifies acquisition facilitation as a benefit of issuing targeted stock and highlights a series of lawsuits that will set important precedents regarding the determination of liability and the estimation of damages in breach of contract cases.",['Benjamin C.

"Cephalon, Inc. Taking risk management theory seriously","Cephalon Inc., a biotech firm, bought call options on its own stock to meet its conditional cash flow needs. We analyze this decision by using the cash flow hedging concepts of Froot et al., (1993. Journal of Finance 5, 1629–1658). We identify the managerial analyses necessary to apply this theory and discuss managerial considerations absent from the theory. We find that managers consider deadweight costs of risk management, which theory tends to ignore. Theory provides little guidance in how to measure these and other deadweight costs. Finally, uncertainty about the availability of external financing and accounting considerations are critical considerations by managers.","['George Chacko', 'Peter Tufano', 'Geoffrey Verter']","['Risk management', 'Corporate financing', 'Option valuation']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000502,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,60,2
An examination of executive stock option repricing,"Comparing a sample of firms that reprice executive stock options in 1998 to a control sample of firms with out-of-the-money options in 1998 that do not reprice, we find that the likelihood of repricing increases for young, high technology firms and firms whose options are more out-of-the-money. Further, we find that firms reprice in response to poor firm-specific, not poor industry, performance. However, we find no evidence that repricing is related to agency problems. Our results are consistent with firms repricing options to restore incentive effects and to deter managers in competitive labor markets from going to work for other firms.","['Mary Ellen Carter', 'Luann J.

Locking out rival bidders: The use of lockup options in corporate mergers,"Conventional wisdom suggests that lockup options are granted by self-interested target managers to discourage competition and hand-select an acquirer, thus harming target shareholder wealth. Evidence from 2,067 deals announced during 1988–1995 suggests that lockup options inhibit competition, but on average, deals with lockup options have higher target announcement and overall returns and lower bidder announcement returns, even after controlling for shareholder anticipation and other factors. An examination of 100 merger proxies suggests lockup options are no more prevalent in privately negotiated, preemptive deals, and average target returns are higher when such deals include a lockup option. The overall evidence is more consistent with managers using lockup options to enhance bargaining power than with lockup options harming shareholder wealth.",['Timothy R Burch'],"['Lockup option', 'Merger', 'Takeover', 'Bidder discrimination']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000411,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,60,1
"Short-sellers, fundamental analysis, and stock returns","Firms with low ratios of fundamentals (such as earning and book values) to market values are known to have systematically lower future stock returns. We document that short-sellers position themselves in the stock of such firms, and then cover their positions as the ratios mean-revert. We also show that short-sellers refine their trading strategies to minimize transactions costs and maximize their investment returns. Our evidence is consistent with short-sellers using information in these ratios to take positions in stocks with lower expected future returns.","['Patricia M Dechow', 'Amy P Hutton', 'Lisa Meulbroek', 'Richard G Sloan']","['Short-sellers', 'Fundamental analysis', 'Trading strategies']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000563,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,61,1
Trading activity and expected stock returns,"Given the evidence that the level of liquidity affects asset returns, a reasonable hypothesis is that the second moment of liquidity should be positively related to asset returns, provided agents care about the risk associated with fluctuations in liquidity. Motivated by this observation, we analyze the relation between expected equity returns and the level as well as the volatility of trading activity, a proxy for liquidity. We document a result contrary to our initial hypothesis, namely, a negative and surprisingly strong cross-sectional relationship between stock returns and the variability of dollar trading volume and share turnover, after controlling for size, book-to-market ratio, momentum, and the level of dollar volume or share turnover. This effect survives a number of robustness checks, and is statistically and economically significant. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of trading activity-related variables in the cross-section of expected stock returns.","['Tarun Chordia', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam', 'V.Ravi Anshuman']","['Asset pricing', 'Anomalies', 'Liquidity']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000805,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,1
Understanding the determinants of managerial ownership and the link between ownership and performance: comment,"Himmelberg et al. (J. Financial Econom. 53 (1999) 353–384) argue that fixed effects estimators should be used in examination of the relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance. I show that managerial ownership, while substantially different across firms, typically changes slowly from year to year within a company. With rational managers maximising long-term utility, small, one-year changes in ownership are not likely to reflect notable changes in incentives that would lead to substantive within-year changes in performance. By relying on within variation, fixed effects estimators may not detect an effect of ownership on performance even if one exists.",['Xianming Zhou'],"['Managerial ownership', 'Corporate governance']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0100085X,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,3
"Common factors in prices, order flows, and liquidity","How important are cross-stock common factors in the price discovery/liquidity provision process in equity markets? We investigate two aspects of this question for the 30 Dow stocks. First, using principal components and canonical correlation analyses we find that both returns and order flows are characterized by common factors. Commonality in the order flows explains roughly two-thirds of the commonality in returns. Second, we examine variation and common covariation in various liquidity proxies and market depth (trade impact) coefficients. Liquidity proxies such as the bid–ask spread and bid–ask quote sizes help explain time variation in trade impacts. The common factors in these liquidity proxies are, however, relatively small.","['Joel Hasbrouck', 'Duane J.

Does Delaware law improve firm value?,"I present evidence consistent with the theory that Delaware corporate law improves firm value and facilitates the sale of public firms. Using Tobin's Q as an estimate of firm value, I find that Delaware firms are worth significantly more than similar firms incorporated elsewhere.

Convergence trading with wealth effects: an amplification mechanism in financial markets,"I study convergence traders with logarithmic utility in a continuous-time equilibrium model. In general, convergence traders reduce asset price volatility and provide liquidity by taking risky positions against noise trading. However, when an unfavorable shock causes them to suffer capital losses, thus eroding their risk-bearing capacity, they liquidate their positions, thereby amplifying the original shock. In extreme circumstances, this wealth effect causes convergence traders to be destabilizing in that they trade in exactly the same direction as noise traders. This situation is consistent with the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.",['Wei Xiong'],"['Convergence trading', 'Wealth effect', 'Volatility amplification', 'Destabilizing speculation', 'LTCM crisis']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000782,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,2
Pay for performance? Government regulation and the structure of compensation contracts,"In 1992–1993, the SEC required enhanced disclosure on executive compensation and Congress enacted tax legislation limiting the deductibility of non-performance related compensation over one million dollars, i.e. Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). We examine the effects of these regulatory changes and report small and large sample evidence that many million-dollar firms have reduced salaries in response to 162(m) and that salary growth rates have declined post-1993 for the firms most likely to be affected by the regulations. We further document that bonus and total compensation payouts are increasingly sensitive to stock returns after 1993, especially for firms with million-dollar pay packages. We also document that, once we control for other factors affecting CEO incentives, the sensitivity of the CEO's wealth to changes in shareholder wealth has increased from 1993 to 1996 for firms with CEOs near or above the million dollar compensation level. Overall, our results suggest that some firms have reduced salaries in response to 162(m). More importantly, the pay for performance sensitivity, measured using total annual compensation and firm-related CEO wealth, has increased for firms likely to be affected by 162(m).","['Tod Perry', 'Marc Zenner']","['CEO compensation', 'Regulation', 'Contracts', 'Corporate governance']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000836,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,3
Credit enhancement through financial engineering: Freeport McMoRan's gold-denominated depositary shares,"In 1993 and 1994, FreeportMcMoRan Copper and Gold issued two series of gold-denominated depositary shares to finance the expansion of its mining capacity in Indonesia. The pricing of these securities reflected their enhanced credit quality, which arose from the positive correlation between the value of the firm and the value of the securities. This feature of the securities effectively bundles a gold hedge with financing. A bundled hedge avoids wealth transfers to senior bondholders, since junior bondholders can effectively net their bond-related claims on the firm against their hedge-related liability to the firm. Such securities cannot be replicated by conventional hedging strategies, and they also mitigate the asset substitution problem.","['N.K Chidambaran', 'Chitru S Fernando', 'Paul A Spindt']","['Risk management', 'Credit enhancement', 'Gold-linked', 'Hybrid securities']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000514,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,60,2
Sixteenths: direct evidence on institutional execution costs,"In June 1997, the New York Stock Exchange lowered its minimum price increment on most stocks from eighths to sixteenths. We use a sample of institutional trades to directly measure the effect of this tick size reduction on execution costs. Though quoted and effective spreads decline, realized execution costs for these institutions increase after the change to sixteenths. Costs increase most for orders that aggressively demand liquidity, including large orders, orders placed by momentum traders, and orders not worked by the trading desk. These findings emphasize that spreads are not a sufficient statistic for market quality. Smaller tick sizes may actually reduce market liquidity.","['Charles M Jones', 'Marc L Lipson']","['Minimum tick', 'Decimalization', 'Implementation costs', 'Transaction costs']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000878,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,2
Why do firms switch underwriters?,"In the mid-1990s, 30% of firms completing an SEO within three years of their IPO switched lead underwriter. This article provides evidence on why they switched. Contrary to predictions of prior research, there is little evidence that firms switch due to dissatisfaction with underwriter performance at the time of the IPO. A surprising result is that switchers’ IPOs were significantly less underpriced than non-switchers’ IPOs. However, switchers raised fewer proceeds than expected, compared to the mid-point of the filing range, while non-switchers raised significantly more proceeds. There are two main reasons for switching. Firms graduate to higher reputation underwriters, and they strategically buy additional and influential analyst coverage from the new lead underwriter. Survey results support these conclusions.","['Laurie Krigman', 'Wayne H Shaw', 'Kent L Womack']","['Underwriter services', 'Underpricing', 'Sell-side research', 'Reputation', 'All-star analysts']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000459,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,60,2
"Direct foreign ownership, institutional investors, and firm characteristics","In this paper, we characterize foreign ownership using a dataset of ownership and attributes of Swedish firms. The analysis reveals that foreigners show a preference for large firms, firms paying low dividends, and firms with large cash positions on their balance sheets. When we further analyze the preference for large firms, we find that market liquidity and presence in international markets, measured through export sales or listings on other exchanges, seem to characterize foreign holdings better than firm size alone. Foreigners also tend to underweight firms with a dominant owner. Importantly, we demonstrate that most of the features associated with foreign ownership are driven by the fact that foreign investors typically are mutual funds or other institutional investors. Hence, we identify an institutional investor bias rather than a foreign investor bias. Finally, using ownership data on a country level, we conclude that the results are particularly strong among U.S. investors, who comprise the largest institutions among foreign investors.","['Magnus Dahlquist', 'Göran Robertsson']","['Individual investors', 'Home bias', 'Market portfolio', 'Mutual funds']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000921,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,3
Discretionary reductions in warrant exercise prices,"Managers can decide to reduce a warrant's exercise price. A reduction in exercise price can induce exercise (a conversion-forcing reduction) or not (a long-term reduction). Conversion-forcing firms show an abnormal return of −1.53% on the announcement day but they perform well over the three years following the announcement. This finding suggests that the funds raised from warrant exercise are invested in profitable projects. Long-term reductions show an abnormal return of −1.15% on the announcement day. These firms also perform well following the reduction, which suggests that the lower exercise price restores managerial incentives.","['John S.

Pricing the strategic value of putable securities in liquidity crises,"Putable security holders have a de facto first claim on the firm's liquid assets and can threaten to force solvent issuers to bear financial distress costs. Their threatening power implies that the puts have a strategic value larger than their intrinsic value. Strategic value depends on the issuer's size, potential distress costs, and the distribution of put ownership relative to the firm's liquidity position.

CEO compensation and bank mergers,"Recent bank mergers generally did not improve relative operating performance or produce positive abnormal returns to acquiring bank shareholders. We examine the relationship between mergers and CEO compensation during 1986–1995, a period marked by overcapacity and frequent mergers. We find that mergers have a net positive effect on compensation, mainly via the effect of size on compensation. Compensation generally increases even if mergers cause the acquiring bank's stock price to decline, as is typical after a merger announcement. The form of compensation affects merger decisions, since CEOs with more stock-based compensation were less likely to make an acquisition.","['Richard T Bliss', 'Richard J Rosen']","['Banking', 'Mergers', 'Compensation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000575,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,61,1
Do investment banks compete in IPOs?: the advent of the “7% plus contract”,"The large number of initial public offerings (IPOs) with a 7% spread suggests either that investment bankers collude to profit from 7% IPOs or that the 7% contract is an efficient innovation that better suits the IPO. My tests do not support the collusion theory. Low concentration and ease of entry characterize the IPO market. Moreover, the 7% spread is not abnormally profitable, nor has its use been diminished by public awareness of collusion allegations.

Disappearing dividends: changing firm characteristics or lower propensity to pay?,"The proportion of firms paying cash dividends falls from 66.5% in 1978 to 20.8% in 1999, due in part to the changing characteristics of publicly traded firms. Fed by new listings, the population of publicly traded firms tilts increasingly toward small firms with low profitability and strong growth opportunities – characteristics typical of firms that have never paid dividends. More interesting, we also show that regardless of their characteristics, firms have become less likely to pay dividends.

The capital gain lock-in effect and long-horizon return reversal,This paper develops and tests an asset pricing model that allows for the presence of a capital gain lock-in effect. The principal empirical implication of this model is that stock returns exhibit reversal behavior over long horizons because of investors’ accrued capital gains. Empirical tests on the cross-section of stock returns find that long-horizon return reversal is primarily attributable to the effect of investors’ accrued capital gains and that the effect is nonlinear in the manner predicted by the model. These finds are robust to the addition of size and past total return to the empirical tests.,['Peter Klein'],"['Capital gains taxation', 'Lock-in effect', 'General equilibrium', 'Return reversal']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000817,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,1

We find that lead analysts identified by our measure of forecast timeliness have a greater impact on stock prices than follower analysts. Further, we find that performance rankings based on forecast timeliness are more informative than rankings based on abnormal trading volume and forecast accuracy. We also present evidence that analyst's forecast revisions are correlated with recent stock price performance, suggesting that security analysts use publicly available information to revise their earnings forecasts.","['Rick A.

We allow the parameters of each model's pricing kernel to fluctuate with the business cycle. While we cannot reject correct pricing for Campbell's (J. Political Econom. 104 (1996) 298) model, stability tests indicate that the parameters may not be stable.

Portfolio choice and equity characteristics: characterizing the hedging demands induced by return predictability,"This paper examines portfolio allocation across equity portfolios formed on the basis of characteristics like size and book-to-market. In particular, the paper assesses the impact of return predictability on portfolio choice for a multi-period investor with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 4. Compared to the investor's allocation in her last period, return predictability with dividend yield causes the investor early in life to tilt her risky-asset portfolio away from high book-to-market stocks and away from small stocks. These results are explained using Merton's (Econometrica 41 (1973) 867) characterization of portfolio allocation by a multi-period investor in a continuous time setting. Abnormal returns relative to the investor's optimal early life portfolio are also calculated. These abnormal returns are found to exhibit the same cross-sectional patterns as abnormal returns calculated relative to the market portfolio: higher for small rather than large firms, and higher for high rather than low book-to-market firms. Thus, hedging demand may be a partial explanation for the high expected returns documented for small firms and high book-to-market firms. However, even with this hedging demand, the investor wants to sell short the low book-to market portfolio to hold the high book-to-market portfolio. The utility costs of using a value-weighted equity index or of ignoring predictability are also calculated. An investor using a value-weighted equity index would give up a much larger fraction of her wealth to have access to book-to-market portfolio than size portfolios. Finally, an investor would give up a much larger fraction of her wealth to have access to dividend yield information than term spread information.",['Anthony W Lynch'],"['Portfolio choice', 'Return predictability', 'Multiple risky assets', 'Hedging demands']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000745,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,1

Risk management theory suggests protection by insurers and other corporations against the largest cat events is most valuable. However, most insurers purchase relatively little cat reinsurance against large events, and premiums are high relative to expected losses. To understand why the theory fails, we examine transactions that look to capital markets, rather than traditional reinsurance markets, for risk-bearing capacity.

The structure of debt and active equity investors: The case of the buyout specialist,"This paper examines the role buyout specialists play in structuring the debt used to finance the LBO and in monitoring management in the post-LBO firm. We find that when buyout specialists control the majority of the post-LBO equity, the LBO transaction is likely to be financed with less short-term and/or senior debt and less likely to experience financial distress. We also find that buyout specialists have greater board representation on smaller boards, suggesting that they actively monitor managers, and that for these transactions, using debt with tighter terms does not significantly increase the firm's performance. In contrast, in all other transactions using such debt does significantly increase the firm's performance. These findings suggest that active monitoring by a buyout specialist substitutes for tighter debt terms in monitoring and motivating managers of LBOs.","['James F Cotter', 'Sarah W Peck']","['Leveraged buyouts', 'Buyout specialists', 'Active investors', 'Financial distress', 'Debt structure']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000830,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,1
The portfolio flows of international investors,"This paper explores daily international portfolio flows into and out of 44 countries from 1994 through 1998. We find several facts concerning the behavior of flows and their relationship with equity returns. First, we detect regional flow factors that have increased in importance through time. Second, the flows appear to be stationary, but far more persistent than returns. Third, flows are strongly influenced by past returns, a finding consistent with positive feedback trading by international investors. Fourth, inflows have positive forecasting power for future equity returns, and this power is statistically significant in emerging markets. Fifth, the sensitivity of local stock prices to foreign inflows is positive and large. Sixth, prices seem consistent with flow persistence, in that transitory inflows impact future returns negatively.","['Kenneth A. Froot', 'Paul G.J. O’Connell', 'Mark S.

We explain the rationale behind these results, and also demonstrate that exercise information generated within a best-fit one-factor model only leads to insignificant losses when properly applied in a two-factor model. Our results provide support for the standard Wall Street practice of using continuously re-calibrated one-factor models to price Bermudan swaptions, as long as calibration procedures are sufficiently comprehensive.","['Leif Andersen', 'Jesper Andreasen']","['Bermudan swaptions', 'Multi-factor gaussian models', 'Multi-factor libor market models', 'Model calibration']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000721,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,1
"Asset liquidity, capital structure, and secured debt","This paper investigates the impact of asset liquidity on the valuation of corporate securities and the firm's financing decisions. I show that asset liquidity increases debt capacity only when bond covenants restrict the disposition of assets. By contrast, I demonstrate that, with unsecured debt, greater liquidity increases credit spreads on corporate debt and reduces optimal leverage. The model also determines the extent to which pledging assets increases firm value and relates the optimal size of the pledge to firm and industry characteristics. Finally, I show that asset liquidity and security provisions may help explain leverage ratios and credit spreads observed in practice.",['Erwan Morellec'],"['Asset liquidity', 'Capital structure', 'Credit spreads', 'Secured debt']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000599,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,61,2
"Bond calls, credible commitment, and equity dilution: a theoretical and clinical analysis of simultaneous tender and call (STAC) offers","This paper is an exploration of the ability of game theory to explain real-world corporate maneuvering. We explore this issue by investigating bond tender offers accompanied by a threat to call nontendered bonds, so called “Simultaneous Tender and Call” (STAC) offers. We argue that STACs engender a transparent game played by bondholders and shareholders. We model this game and use this model to predict the outcome of STACs. Finally, we investigate the issue of whether this theoretical model explains the outcomes of four actual STAC issues made by James River, May Department Stores, and Houston Lighting & Power Company. Our clinical analysis provides support for the explanatory power of our model. Calibrating the predictions of the model with data from these STACs, we demonstrate a correspondence between theory and actual corporate behavior. As predicted by our model, subgame perfection, or threat credibility, and preplay coordination are central to explaining the outcomes of the STACs.","['Upinder S. Dhillon', 'Thomas H.

Firm performance and executive compensation in the savings and loan industry,"This paper offers a new way to estimate the relation between pay and performance. In particular, unlike previous analyses, we account for the heterogeneity that theory tells us should exist across the compensation packages of different firms. Accounting for heterogeneity allows for more efficient estimates of the pay-for-performance relation and provides a means of testing the secondary hypotheses of agency theory. Among our findings are strong evidence of inter-firm heterogeneity in compensation, even within the same industry, the existence of trade-offs in using different performance measures, and insights about the factors that influence compensation packages.","['Benjamin E.

An equilibrium model of irreversible investment,"This paper presents a general equilibrium model of a two-sector production economy with irreversible real investment. Irreversibility of investment is the most prominent feature of the productive sector. It restricts capital accumulation, affecting firms’ investment decisions, which in turn determine properties of asset prices. Thus, this model provides a framework for connecting stock returns to firm characteristics that proxy for real economic activity. The primary focus of this paper is on the analysis of the equilibrium and the effects of irreversibility of investment.",['Leonid Kogan'],"['Investment', 'Irreversibility', 'General equilibrium', 'Leverage effect', 'Book-to-market']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000770,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,2
Extracting factors from heteroskedastic asset returns,"This paper proposes an alternative to the asymptotic principal components procedure of Connor and Korajczyk (J. Financial Econom. 15 (1986) 373) that is robust to time series heteroskedasticity in the factor model residuals. The new method is simple to use and requires no assumptions stronger than those made by Connor and Korajczyk. It is demonstrated through simulations and analysis of actual stock market data that allowing heteroskedasticity sometimes improves the quality of the extracted factors quite dramatically. Over the period from 1989 to 1993, for example, a single factor extracted using the Connor and Korajczyk method explains only 8.2% of the variation of the CRSP value-weighted index, while the factor extracted allowing heteroskedasticity explains 57.3%. Accounting for heteroskedasticity is also important for tests of the APT, with p-values sometimes depending strongly on the factor extraction method used.",['Christopher S Jones'],"['Principal components', 'Factor analysis', 'Heteroskedasticity', 'Arbitrage pricing theory']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000794,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,2
On the choice and replacement of chief financial officers,"This paper provides empirical evidence regarding why firms replace their CFOs. Empirical tests are based on a sample of 2,227 CFO appointments over the 1984–1997 time period. Key findings reported in the paper are: (a) external CFO succession rate is markedly higher than the external CEO succession rate, (b) the incidence of retirement is less common for serving CFOs as compared to the top executive, (c) CFO turnover is preceded by negative excess returns, (d) CFO turnover is preceded by a decline in operating return on assets in the pre-period, (e) announcements of CFO turnover are associated with a significant negative stock price reaction when old CFO quits and firm replaces with an internal appointment, and (f) CFO turnover is preceded by abnormally high CEO turnover. Overall, evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that CFO turnovers are disciplinary. Evidence is also consistent with the hypothesis that rapid sales growth accompanied by weak operating performance leads firms to bring in outside talent.",['Shehzad Mian'],"['Management turnover', 'Corporate governance']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000423,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,60,1
Stockholder gains from focusing versus diversifying bank mergers,"This paper shows bank mergers that enhance value upon announcement can be distinguished from those that do not create value. I classify mergers of banking firms according to activity and geographic similarity (focus) or dissimilarity (diversification), and examine the abnormal returns to each group as a result of the merger announcement. Mergers that focus both activity and geography enhance stockholder value by 3.0% while the other types do not create value. Analysis reveals that abnormal returns upon merger announcement increase in relative size of target to bidder, but decrease in the pre-merger performance of targets.",['Gayle L.

Throwing away a billion dollars: the cost of suboptimal exercise strategies in the swaptions market,"This paper studies the costs of applying single-factor exercise strategies to American swap options when the term structure is actually driven by multiple factors. Using a multifactor string market model of the term structure, we find that even when single-factor models are recalibrated to match the market at every exercise date, the exercise strategies they imply can be suboptimal. Based on estimates of notional amounts outstanding, the total present value costs of following single-factor strategies could be several billion dollars. These results illustrate the importance of using well-specified term structure models.","['Francis A Longstaff', 'Pedro Santa-Clara', 'Eduardo S Schwartz']","['American option', 'Exercise strategy', 'Term structure', 'Model misspecification']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000733,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,1
Exchange rate exposure and competition: evidence from the automotive industry,"This study examines the effect of real exchange rate changes on multinational firms and incorporates the effect of intra-industry competition on the relation between exchange rates and firm value. To test the relation more effectively, tests are conducted using a sample of automotive firms from the United States and Japan. Consistent with theoretical predictions, there is significant exposure to exchange rate shocks. Moreover, there is evidence of time-variation in exchange rate exposure, which is consistent with changes in the competitive environment within the industry. Finally, evidence is presented that is consistent with foreign sales being a major determinant of exposure and the effectiveness of operational hedging through foreign production.",['Rohan Williamson'],"['Exchange rate exposure', 'Risk management', 'Currency exposure', 'International corporate finance']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000933,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,3

Where do merger gains come from? Bank mergers from the perspective of insiders and outsiders,"Traditional studies fail to find conclusive evidence that bank mergers create value. We analyze a sample of the largest bank mergers between 1985 and 1996. For a subset of this sample, we obtain management estimates of projected cost savings and revenue enhancements. We find that recent mergers appear to result in positive revaluations of the combined value of bidder and target stocks. Although not as large as the present value of management's estimates, with the bulk of the revaluation being attributable to estimated cost savings rather than projected revenue enhancements.","['Joel F Houston', 'Christopher M James', 'Michael D Ryngaert']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Bank mergers']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000460,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,60,2
Do the individuals closest to internet firms believe they are overvalued,"Two explanations are commonly offered for the large number of recent IPOs by Internet firms. The first argues that Internet firms are trying to grab market share in an industry with large economies of scale. The second argues that Internet firms are rushing to go public when Internet stock prices are irrationally high. In this paper we examine the actions of those closest to Internet firms – firm managers, underwriters, and venture capitalists – to determine their motives for going public. Numerous strategic alliances and mergers and acquisitions provide strong evidence of a rush to grab market share. Other factors provide only weak evidence that Internet IPOs are attempts to sell overpriced stock.","['Paul Schultz', 'Mir Zaman']","['Internet', 'IPO', 'Mergers', 'Market efficiency']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000908,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,3
Stealth-trading: Which traders’ trades move stock prices?,Using audit trail data for a sample of NYSE firms we show that medium-size trades are associated with a disproportionately large cumulative stock price change relative to their proportion of all trades and volume. This result is consistent with the predictions of Barclay and Warner's (1993) stealth-trading hypothesis. We find that the source of this disproportionately large cumulative price impact of medium-size trades is trades initiated by institutions. This result is robust to various sensitivity checks. Our findings appear to confirm street lore that institutions are informed traders.,['Sugato Chakravarty'],"['Stealth-trading', 'Price impact', 'Institutions', 'Individuals', 'Microstructure']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000630,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,61,2
The duration of bank relationships,"We analyze the duration of bank relationships using a unique panel data set of listed firms and their banks from the bank-dominated Norwegian market. We find that firms are more likely to leave a bank as the relationship matures. Small, profitable, and highly leveraged firms maintain shorter bank relationships, as do firms with multiple bank relationships. These findings are robust to censoring, alternate specifications for the distribution of relationship duration, and other control variables relevant to the Norwegian market. Overall, our results cast doubt on theories suggesting that firms become locked into bank relationships.","['Steven Ongena', 'David C Smith']","['bank relationships', 'hazard models', 'duration analysis']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000691,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,61,3
Capital budgeting and compensation with asymmetric information and moral hazard,"We consider optimal capital allocation and managerial compensation mechanisms for decentralized firms when division managers have an incentive to misrepresent project quality and to minimize privately costly but value-enhancing effort. We show that in the optimal mechanism firms always underinvest in capital relative to a naive application of the net present value (NPV) rule. We make a number of novel cross-sectional predictions about the severity of the underinvestment problem and the composition of managerial compensation contracts. We also find that firms will optimally give greater performance-based pay (at the expense of fixed wages) to managers of higher quality projects to mitigate the incentive for managers to overstate project quality. Managers may thus receive greater performance-based pay because they manage higher quality projects, not that greater performance-based pay causes firm value to increase.","['Antonio E.

"Forecasting crashes: trading volume, past returns, and conditional skewness in stock prices","We develop a series of cross-sectional regression specifications to forecast skewness in the daily returns of individual stocks. Negative skewness is most pronounced in stocks that have experienced (1) an increase in trading volume relative to trend over the prior six months, consistent with the model of Hong and Stein (NBER Working Paper, 1999), and (2) positive returns over the prior 36 months, which fits with a number of theories, most notably Blanchard and Watson's (Crises in Economic and Financial Structure. Lexington Books, Lexington, MA, 1982, pp. 295–315) rendition of stock-price bubbles. Analogous results also obtain when we attempt to forecast the skewness of the aggregate stock market, though our statistical power in this case is limited.","['Joseph Chen', 'Harrison Hong', 'Jeremy C Stein']","['Crashes', 'Trading volume', 'Skewness']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000666,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,61,3
The distribution of realized stock return volatility,"We examine “realized” daily equity return volatilities and correlations obtained from high-frequency intraday transaction prices on individual stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We find that the unconditional distributions of realized variances and covariances are highly right-skewed, while the realized logarithmic standard deviations and correlations are approximately Gaussian, as are the distributions of the returns scaled by realized standard deviations. Realized volatilities and correlations show strong temporal dependence and appear to be well described by long-memory processes. Finally, there is strong evidence that realized volatilities and correlations move together in a manner broadly consistent with latent factor structure.","['Torben G.

Stock option plans for non-executive employees,"We examine determinants of non-executive employee stock option holdings, grants, and exercises for 756 firms during 1994–1997. We find that firms use greater stock option compensation when facing capital requirements and financing constraints. Our results are also consistent with firms using options to attract and retain certain types of employees as well as to create incentives to increase firm value. After controlling for economic determinants and stock returns, option exercises are greater (less) when the firm's stock price hits 52-week highs (lows), which confirms in a broad sample the psychological bias documented by Heath et al. (Quarterly Journal of Economics 114 (1999) 601–628).","['John E. Core', 'Wayne R.

Corporate payout policy and managerial stock incentives,"We examine how corporate payout policy is affected by managerial stock incentives using data on more than 1,100 nonfinancial firms during 1993–97. We find that management stock ownership is associated with higher payouts by firms with potentially the greatest agency problems – those with low management stock ownership and few investment opportunities or high free cash flow. We also find that management stock options are related to the composition of payouts. We find a strong negative relationship between dividends and management stock options, as predicted by Lambert et al (1989), and a positive relationship between repurchases and management stock options. Our results suggest that the growth in stock options may help to explain the rise in repurchases at the expense of dividends.","['George W.

The performance of professional market timers: daily evidence from executed strategies,"We examine the performance of 30 professional market timers during 1986–1994. Prior studies have analyzed implicit recommendations from mutual fund returns or explicit recommendations from newsletters. We analyze explicit recommendations executed in customer accounts. Using four tests, three benchmark portfolios, and daily data, we find significant unconditional and conditional ability that is robust with respect to transaction costs and survivorship bias. Relative ability persists and varies with the frequency of recommendation changes. When recommendations of successful timers are observed monthly instead of daily, significant ability generally disappears. Hence, the frequency with which recommendations are observed can change inferences regarding ability.","['Don M Chance', 'Michael L Hemler']","['Market timing', 'Performance evaluation', 'Portfolio management', 'Asset allocation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000812,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,2
"Information production, dilution costs, and optimal security design","We investigate the problem of a firm wishing to finance a project by issuing securities under asymmetric information. We find that, when outside investors can produce (noisy) information on the firm's quality, the degree of information asymmetry resulting in equilibrium is endogenous and depends on the information sensitivity of the security issued. Thus, in contrast to the prediction of the pecking order theory (see, e.g. Myers and Majluf, J. Financial Econom. 13 (1984) 187) a security with low sensitivity to private information, such as debt, does not always dominate one with high information sensitivity, such as equity. A firm's preference for equity rather than debt depends on the costs of information production, the precision of the information-production technology, and the extent of the information asymmetry. We also study the optimal security design problem and find that, depending on the cost and precision of the information-production technology, risky debt or a composite security with a convex payoff emerges as optimal securities.","['Paolo Fulghieri', 'Dmitry Lukin']","['Security design', 'Information production', 'Pecking order theory']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0100054X,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,61,1
Managerial timing and corporate liquidity:,"We investigate the timing of open market share repurchases and the resultant impact on firm liquidity. Using the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's unique disclosure environment, we identify the exact implementation dates for more than five thousand equity buybacks. We find that managers exhibit substantial timing ability. Consistent with the information-asymmetry hypothesis, bid–ask spreads widen and depths narrow during repurchase periods. We decompose bid–ask spreads and show that adverse selection costs increase substantially as market participants respond to the presence of informed managerial trading. Our findings provide additional insight into how markets process information and have significant implications for corporate payout and disclosure policies.","['Paul Brockman', 'Dennis Y.

Bankers on boards:,"We investigate the trade-off between the benefits from bank monitoring when a banker is represented on a firm's board and the costs from two sources: conflicts of interests between lenders and shareholders, and U.S. legal doctrines that generate lender liability for bankers on boards of firms in financial distress. Consistent with high costs of active involvement, bankers are on boards of large, stable firms with high proportions of collateralizable assets and low reliance on short-term financing. While permitting banks to own equity could mitigate conflicts, the protection of shareholder versus creditor rights could continue to reduce the role of U.S. banks in corporate governance.","['Randall S Kroszner', 'Philip E Strahan']","['Banking and commerce', 'Boards of directors', 'Conflicts of interest', 'Lender liability']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000824,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,3
Predictable changes in yields and forward rates,"We make two contributions to the study of interest rates. The first is to characterize their dynamics in a new way. We estimate forecasting relations based on one-period changes in forward rates, which are more easily compared than earlier work on yields to the stationary theory of bond pricing. The second is to approximate these dynamics and other salient features of interest rates with an affine model. We show that models with “negative” factors come closer to accounting for the properties of interest rates, including their dynamics, than multifactor Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models.","['David Backus', 'Silverio Foresi', 'Abon Mozumdar', 'Liuren Wu']","['Forecasting', 'Term premiums', 'Expectations hypothesis', 'Pricing kernels', 'Affine models']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0000088X,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,3
Pricing and hedging in incomplete markets,"We present a new approach for positioning, pricing, and hedging in incomplete markets that bridges standard arbitrage pricing and expected utility maximization. Our approach for determining whether an investor should undertake a particular position involves specifying a set of probability measures and associated floors which expected payoffs must exceed in order for the investor to consider the hedged and financed investment to be acceptable. By assuming that the liquid assets are priced so that each portfolio of assets has negative expected return under at least one measure, we derive a counterpart to the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing. We also derive a counterpart to the second fundamental theorem, which leads to unique derivative security pricing and hedging even though markets are incomplete. For products that are not spanned by the liquid assets of the economy, we show how our methodology provides more realistic bid–ask spreads.","['Peter Carr', 'Helyette Geman', 'Dilip B Madan']","['Risk management', 'State price density', 'Unique Martingale measure', 'Complete markets', 'Option pricing']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000757,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,1
Leverage and internal capital markets: evidence from leveraged recapitalizations,"We study the internal allocation of resources for diversified firms that complete a leveraged recapitalization. Before the recapitalization, internal capital markets allocate investment to high q segments. After the recapitalization, segment investment becomes less sensitive to q and more sensitive to segment cash flow. We show that firm value is positively related to investment's sensitivity to segment q and negatively related to investment's sensitivity to segment cash flow. Our analysis highlights an indirect cost of debt that has received little attention: pressure to meet interest obligations creates an incentive to emphasize investments that generate high levels of current cash flow.","['Urs C.

Linking pay to performance—compensation proposals in the S&P 500,"We study the proposal of manager-sponsored compensation plans linking pay to performance by S&P 500 firms in the 1990s. We examine the market perception of these proposals and the characteristics of the firms that propose them. Shareholders gain at the announcement of the plans, especially when the plans are directed toward the firm's top executives. Proposing firms are those that can most benefit from the plans, given their asset type and agency considerations. Firms with more potential agency costs have the highest vote-for percentages for the plans. However, shareholders are less approving of plans with negative features such as high dilution levels. Our work suggests that stock-based compensation plans are helpful in improving managerial efforts to increase shareholder wealth.","['Angela G Morgan', 'Annette B Poulsen']","['Incentives', 'Executive compensation', 'Proxy voting']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000848,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,62,3
Aggregate price effects of institutional trading: a study of mutual fund flow and market returns,"We study the relation between market returns and aggregate flow into U.S. equity funds, using daily flow data. The concurrent daily relation is positive. Our tests show that this concurrent relation reflects flow and institutional trading affecting returns. This daily relation is similar in magnitude to the price impact reported for an individual institution's trades in a stock. Aggregate flow also follows market returns with a one-day lag. The lagged response of flow suggests either a common response of both returns and flow to new information, or positive feedback trading.","['Roger M Edelen', 'Jerold B Warner']","['Mutual funds', 'Institutional trading', 'Price impact']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000854,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,59,2
The theory and practice of corporate finance: evidence from the field,"We survey 392 CFOs about the cost of capital, capital budgeting, and capital structure. Large firms rely heavily on present value techniques and the capital asset pricing model, while small firms are relatively likely to use the payback criterion. A surprising number of firms use firm risk rather than project risk in evaluating new investments. Firms are concerned about financial flexibility and credit ratings when issuing debt, and earnings per share dilution and recent stock price appreciation when issuing equity. We find some support for the pecking-order and trade-off capital structure hypotheses but little evidence that executives are concerned about asset substitution, asymmetric information, transactions costs, free cash flows, or personal taxes.","['John R Graham', 'Campbell R Harvey']","['Capital structure', 'Cost of capital', 'Cost of equity', 'Capital budgeting', 'Discount rates', 'Project valuation', 'Survey']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X01000447,Journal of Financial Economics,2001,60,2
