Managerial myopia and the mortgage meltdown,"Prominent policy makers assert that managerial short-termism was at the root of the subprime crisis of 2007–2009. Prior scholarly research, however, largely rejects this assertion. Using a more comprehensive measure of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) incentives for short-termism, we uncover evidence that short-termism indeed played a role. Firms whose CEOs were contractually allowed to sell or exercise more of their stock and options holdings sooner had more subprime exposure, a higher probability of financial distress, and lower risk-adjusted stock returns during the crisis, as well as higher fines and settlements for subprime-related fraud.","['Adam C.

Downside risks and the cross-section of asset returns,"In an intertemporal equilibrium asset pricing model featuring disappointment aversion and changing macroeconomic uncertainty, we show that besides the market return and market volatility, three disappointment-related factors are also priced: a downstate factor, a market downside factor, and a volatility downside factor. We find that expected returns on various asset classes reflect premiums for bearing undesirable exposures to these factors. The signs of estimated risk premiums are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Our most general, five-factor model is very successful in jointly pricing stock, option, and currency portfolios, and provides considerable improvement over nested specifications previously discussed in the literature.","['Adam Farago', 'Roméo Tédongap']","['Generalized disappointment aversion', 'Downside risks', 'Cross-section']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300813,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,129,1
Government guarantees and the two-way feedback between banking and sovereign debt crises,"This paper studies the effects of government guarantees on the interconnection between banking and sovereign debt crises in a framework where both the banks and the government are fragile and the credibility and feasibility of the guarantees are determined endogenously. The analysis delivers some new results on the role of guarantees in the bank-sovereign nexus. First, guarantees emerge as a key channel linking banks’ and sovereign stability, even in the absence of banks’ holdings of sovereign bonds. Second, depending on the specific characteristics of the economy and the nature of banking crises, an increase in the size of guarantees can be beneficial for the bank-sovereign nexus in that it enhances financial stability without undermining sovereign solvency.",['Agnese Leonello'],"['Bank runs', 'Sovereign default', 'Strategic complementarity', 'Government bond yield']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300977,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,3
Network centrality and delegated investment performance,"We show a positive relation between network centrality and risk-adjusted performance in a delegated investment management setting. More connected managers take more portfolio risk and receive higher investor flows, consistent with these managers improving their ability to exploit investment opportunities through their network connections. Greater network connections are shown to be particularly important in reducing the diseconomies of scale for large managers who are well connected. We also use the exogenous merger of two investment consultants, which creates a sudden change in the network connections of the managers they oversee, to provide evidence that a greater number of connections translates into better portfolio performance.","['Alberto G.

Stocks with extreme past returns: Lotteries or insurance?,"The paper shows that lottery-like stocks are hedges against unexpected increases in market volatility. The loading on the aggregate volatility risk factor explains the majority of low abnormal returns to stocks with high maximum returns in the past month (Bali et al., 2011) and high expected skewness (Boyer et al., 2010). Aggregate volatility risk also explains the new evidence that the maximum effect and the skewness effect are stronger for firms with high market to book or high expected probability of bankruptcy.",['Alexander Barinov'],"['Extreme returns', 'Skewness', 'Lottery', 'Idiosyncratic volatility', 'Aggregate volatility risk']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301557,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,129,3
"Company stock price reactions to the 2016 election shock: Trump, taxes, and trade","Donald Trump's surprise election shifted expectations: corporate taxes would be lower and trade policies more restrictive. Relative stock prices responded appropriately. High-tax firms and those with large deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) gained; those with significant deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards (NOL DTAs) lost. Domestically focused companies fared better than internationally oriented firms. A price contribution analysis shows that easily assessed consequences (DTLs, NOL DTAs, tax rates) were priced faster than more complex issues (net DTLs, foreign exposure). In sum, the analysis demonstrates that expectations about tax rates greatly impact firm values.","['Alexander F. Wagner', 'Richard J.

Does policy uncertainty affect mergers and acquisitions?,"Political and regulatory uncertainty is strongly negatively associated with merger and acquisition activity at the macro and firm levels. The strongest effects are for uncertainty regarding taxes, government spending, monetary and fiscal policies, and regulation. Consistent with a real options channel, the effect is exacerbated for less reversible deals and for firms whose product demand or stock returns exhibit greater sensitivity to policy uncertainty, but attenuated for deals that cannot be delayed due to competition and for deals that hedge firm-level risk. Contractual mechanisms (deal premiums, termination fees, MAC clauses) unanimously point to policy uncertainty increasing the target’s negotiating power.","['Alice Bonaime', 'Huseyin Gulen', 'Mihai Ion']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Policy uncertainty', 'Real options']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301338,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,129,3
How does hedge fund activism reshape corporate innovation?,"This paper studies how hedge fund activism impacts corporate innovation. Firms targeted by activists improve their innovation efficiency over the five-year period following hedge fund intervention. Despite a tightening in research and development (R&D) expenditures, target firms increase innovation output, as measured by both patent counts and citations, with stronger effects among firms with more diversified innovation portfolios. Reallocation of innovative resources, redeployment of human capital, and change to board-level expertise all contribute to improve target firms’ innovation. Additional tests help isolate the effect of intervention from alternative explanations, including mean reversion, sample attrition, voluntary reforms, or activist stock-picking.","['Alon Brav', 'Wei Jiang', 'Song Ma', 'Xuan Tian']","['Hedge fund activism', 'Innovation', 'Resource allocation', 'Human capital redeployment']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301727,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,2
What makes the bonding stick? A natural experiment testing the legal bonding hypothesis,"We use a US Supreme Court case, Morrison v. National Australia Bank (2010), as a natural experiment to test the legal bonding hypothesis. By decreasing the potential liability of US-listed foreign firms, particularly due to class action lawsuits, Morrison arguably eroded their legal bonding to compliance with disclosure duties. Nevertheless, we find evidence of an increase or insignificant change in share values. Tests of longer-run effects of the legal event indicate that foreign firms’ disclosure quality and likelihood of facing enforcement actions remained stable, as did investors’ revealed preferences for trading on US markets. These results go against the legal bonding hypothesis but are consistent with reputational bonding and with market-based accounts of US cross-listing. Our results may contribute to ongoing debate about civil enforcement of securities laws through class actions.","['Amir N. Licht', 'Christopher Poliquin', 'Jordan I.

The real effects of credit default swaps,"We examine the effect of introducing credit default swaps (CDSs) on firm value. Our model allows for dynamic investment and financing, and bondholders can trade in the CDS market. The model incorporates both negative and positive effects of CDSs. CDS markets lead to more liquidations, but they also reduce the probability of costly debt renegotiation and reduce costly equity financing. After calibrating the model, we find that firm value increases by 2.9% on average with the introduction of a CDS market. Firms also invest more and increase leverage. The effect on firm value is strongest for small, financially constrained, and low productivity firms.","['András Danis', 'Andrea Gamba']","['Credit default swaps', 'CDS', 'Empty creditor', 'Restructuring', 'Bankruptcy']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302556,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,1
The effects of q and cash flow on investment in the presence of measurement error,"I analyze investment, q, and cash flow in a tractable stochastic model in which marginal q and average q are identically equal. I introduce classical measurement error and derive closed-form expressions for the coefficients in regressions of investment on q and cash flow. The cash-flow coefficient is positive and larger for faster growing firms, yet there are no financial frictions in the model. I develop the concepts of bivariate attenuation and weight shifting to interpret the estimated coefficients on q and cash flow in the presence of measurement error.",['Andrew B.

Taxation and executive compensation: Evidence from stock options,"Understanding the effects of taxes on executive compensation provides insight into the process determining this compensation and is a key input to top income tax rate policy. A 2010 tax reform in Canada, which greatly increased the effective tax rate on stock option compensation for a subset of firms, provides a natural experiment with which to address this issue. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest that this tax increase resulted in an immediate reduction in both stock option grants and the fraction of total compensation made up of stock options with limited, if any, substitution towards other components of compensation.",['Andrew Bird'],"['Executive compensation', 'Taxation', 'Stock options']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302945,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,2
Liquidity risk and maturity management over the credit cycle,"We show that firm demand-side factors are strong drivers of procyclical refinancing behavior over the credit cycle using novel data from the Shared National Credit program. Firms are more likely to refinance early when credit conditions are good to keep the effective maturity of their loans long and hedge against having to refinance in tight credit conditions. High credit quality firms are better able to hedge, making their refinancing propensity more sensitive to credit cycles than less creditworthy firms. There is a strong relationship between refinancing a loan, and subsequent growth in capital expenditure, especially when a loan is refinanced early.","['Atif Mian', 'João A.C.

Are stock-financed takeovers opportunistic?,"The more the target knows about the bidder, the more difficult is paying the target with overpriced bidder shares. Thus, when bidders are opportunistic, the fraction of stock in the deal payment will be lower for better informed targets. We test this intuitive prediction against the alternative that stock payments primarily reflect bidder concerns with target adverse selection, which implies a greater fraction of stock in the deal payment for better informed targets. Discriminating between these two mutually exclusive and nested predictions requires measures of target information about the bidder but not of market mispricing. We find that public bidders systematically use more stock in the payment when the target knows more about the bidder. Tests exploiting exogenous variation in bidder market-to-book ratios also fail to support bidder opportunism. Finally, greater potential competition from private bidders is associated with greater propensity for public bidders to pay in cash.","['B. Espen Eckbo', 'Tanakorn Makaew', 'Karin S.

Cash windfalls and acquisitions,"This article studies the effect of cash windfalls on the acquisition policy of companies. As identification, I use a German tax reform that permitted firms to sell their equity stakes tax free. Companies that could realize a cash windfall by selling equity stakes see an increase in the probability of acquiring another company by 14%. I find that these additional acquisitions destroy firm value. Following the tax reform, affected firms experience a decrease of 1.2 percentage points in acquisition announcement returns. These effects are stronger for larger cash windfalls. My findings are consistent with the free cash flow theory.",['Bastian von Beschwitz'],"['Acquisitions', 'Free cash flow theory', 'Overinvestment']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300485,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,2
Four centuries of return predictability,"We combine annual stock market data for the most important equity markets of the last four centuries: the Netherlands and UK (1629–1812), UK (1813–1870), and US (1871–2015). We show that dividend yields are stationary and consistently forecast returns. The documented predictability holds for annual and multi-annual horizons and works both in- and out-of-sample, providing strong evidence that expected returns in stock markets are time-varying. In part, this variation is related to the business cycle, with expected returns increasing in recessions. We also find that, except for the period after 1945, dividend yields predict dividend growth rates.","['Benjamin Golez', 'Peter Koudijs']","['Dividend-to-price ratio', 'Return predictability', 'Dividend growth predictability']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303185,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,2
"The consequences of managerial indiscretions: Sex, lies, and firm value","Personal managerial indiscretions are separate from a firm's business activities but provide information about the manager's integrity. Consequently, they could affect counterparties’ trust in the firm and the firm's value and operations. We find that companies of accused executives experience significant wealth deterioration, reduced operating margins, and lost business partners. Indiscretions are also associated with an increased probability of unrelated shareholder-initiated lawsuits, Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations, and managed earnings. Further, chief executive officers and boards face labor market consequences, including forced turnover, pay cuts, and lower shareholder votes at re-election. Indiscretions occur more often at poorly governed firms where disciplinary turnover is less likely.","['Brandon N. Cline', 'Ralph A. Walkling', 'Adam S.

The buyers’ perspective on security design: Hedge funds and convertible bond call provisions,"We provide evidence that security design reflects the interplay of capital supplier and security issuer preferences. While call provisions have historically been the default option in convertible security design, only a minority of post-2005 issues are callable. Because hedge funds dominate the market for new convertibles today and because convertible arbitrage is less risky without callability, the recent diminution in the frequency of call provisions in new convertible bond issues illustrates the importance of the preferences of the suppliers of capital in security design.","['Bruce D.

In search of ideas: Technological innovation and executive pay inequality,"We develop a general equilibrium model that delivers realistic fluctuations in pay inequality as a result of changes in the technology frontier. In our model, executives add value to the firm not only by participating in production decisions, as do other workers in the economy, but also by identifying new investment opportunities. Improvements in technology that are specific to new vintages of capital raise the return to managers’ skills for discovering new growth projects and, thus, increase the compensation of executives relative to workers and disparities in pay across executives. Our model implies that, controlling for firm size, compensation is higher in fast-growing firms and that pay inequality increases as investment opportunities in the economy improve. Both predictions are consistent with the data.","['Carola Frydman', 'Dimitris Papanikolaou']","['Executive compensation', 'Inequality', 'Technology', 'Innovation']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301740,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,1
Regulating dark trading: Order flow segmentation and market quality,"We examine the impact of a rule in the Canadian equities market that requires dark orders to offer price improvement over displayed orders. We show that this rule eliminated intermediation of retail orders in the dark and shifted retail orders onto the lit market with the lowest trading fee. Intermediaries shifted liquidity supply to this market leading to increased displayed liquidity. We conclude that reducing retail order segmentation enhances lit liquidity. Despite the improvement in liquidity, retail traders receive less price improvement. Retail brokers pay higher trading fees to exchanges, and high-frequency traders earn higher revenues from trading fees.","['Carole Comerton-Forde', 'Katya Malinova', 'Andreas Park']","['Dark trading', 'Trade-at rule', 'Price improvement', 'Segmentation', 'Retail internalization']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301788,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,2
Employee representation and financial leverage,"We analyze how direct employee voice affects financial leverage. German law mandates that firms’ supervisory boards consist of an equal number of employees’ and owners’ representatives. This requirement, however, applies only to firms with more than two thousand domestic employees. We exploit this discontinuity and the law’s introduction in 1976 for identification and find that direct employee power increases financial leverage. This is explained by a supply side effect: as banks’ interests are similar to those of employees, higher employee power reduces agency conflicts with debt providers, leading to better financing conditions. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of direct employee influence.","['Chen Lin', 'Thomas Schmid', 'Yuhai Xuan']","['Capital structure', 'Financial leverage', 'Employee representation', 'Labor rights', 'Bank ownership']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303136,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,2
"Size matters, if you control your junk","The size premium has been accused of having a weak historical record, being meager relative to other factors, varying significantly over time, weakening after its discovery, being concentrated among microcap stocks, residing predominantly in January, relying on price-based measures, and being weak internationally. We find, however, that these challenges disappear when controlling for the quality, or its inverse, junk, of a firm. A significant size premium emerges, which is stable through time, robust to specification, not concentrated in microcaps, more consistent across seasons, and evident for non-price-based measures of size, and these results hold in 30 different industries and 24 international equity markets. The resurrected size effect is on par with anomalies such as value and momentum in terms of economic significance and gives rise to new tests of, and challenges for, existing asset pricing theories.","['Clifford Asness', 'Andrea Frazzini', 'Ronen Israel', 'Tobias J.

Equity issuances and agency costs: The telling story of shareholder approval around the world,"Mandatory shareholder approval of equity issuances varies across and within countries. When shareholders approve issuances, average announcement returns are positive. When managers issue stock without shareholder approval, returns are negative and 4% lower. The closer the vote is to the issuance or the greater is the required plurality, the higher are the returns for public offers, rights offers, and private placements. When shareholder approval is required, rights offers predominate. When managers may issue stock without shareholder approval, public offers predominate.

Home away from home? Foreign demand and London house prices,"Identifying the effects of “flights to safety” on asset prices using pure time-series methods is difficult because crises are infrequent. We develop a new cross-sectional identification approach, motivated by the insight that investors may differ in their “preferred habitats” within a broad asset class. We apply the method to the question of whether foreign capital is responsible for residential real estate price movements in global cities such as London and New York, especially during crises. Using large data sets of housing transactions, we find that foreign risk strongly affects London house prices. The effects are long-lasting, and are associated with both safe-haven effects and immigration.","['Cristian Badarinza', 'Tarun Ramadorai']","['House prices', 'Safe-haven demand', 'Political risk']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301867,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,3
Do universal banks finance riskier but more productive firms?,"Using variation in bank scope generated by the stepwise repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act in the US, we show that the deregulation of universal banks allowed them to finance firms with 14% higher volatility. This increase in risk is compensated by lasting improvements in firms’ total factor productivity of 3%. Using bank scope-expanding mergers to identify shocks to universal banks’ private information about borrower firms, we provide evidence that informational economies of scope across loans and non-loan products account for the firm-level real effects of universal banking.","['Daniel Neuhann', 'Farzad Saidi']","['Universal banking', 'Financial deregulation', 'Bank scope', 'Firewalls', 'Cross-selling']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300254,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,1
Term structures of asset prices and returns,"We explore the term structures of claims to a variety of cash flows, namely, US government bonds (claims to dollars), foreign government bonds (claims to foreign currency), inflation-adjusted bonds (claims to the price index), and equity (claims to future equity indexes or dividends). The average term structures reflect the dynamics of the dollar pricing kernel, cash flow growth, and the interaction between the two. We use an affine model to illustrate how these two components can deliver term structures with a wide range of levels and shapes. Finally, we calibrate a representative agent economy to show that the evidence is consistent with the equilibrium models.","['David Backus', 'Nina Boyarchenko', 'Mikhail Chernov']","['Entropy', 'Coentropy', 'Term structure', 'Yields', 'Excess returns', 'Affine models', 'Recursive preferences', 'Disasters']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300990,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,129,1
Management sub-advising in the mutual fund industry,"This is a study of how contractual mechanisms can mitigate agency conflicts in sub-advised mutual funds. Sub-advising contracts allow fund families to expand their product offerings to include new investment styles and thereby gain market share. We show that costly contractual arrangements, such as co-branding, multi-advising, and performance-based compensation, can mitigate agency conflicts in outsourcing and protect investors from potential underperformance. Fund families will find it cost-effective to implement such incentive mechanisms only when investors are sophisticated in assessing manager skill. The findings help to explain why a large percentage of fund families outsource their funds to advisory firms.","['David Moreno', 'Rosa Rodríguez', 'Rafael Zambrana']","['Outsourcing', 'Sub-advisor', 'Mutual funds', 'Management company', 'Incentive contracts', 'Fund performance', 'Market share', 'Agency issue']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300175,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,3
Corporate governance of banks and financial stability,"We find that shareholder-friendly corporate governance is associated with higher stand-alone and systemic risk in the banking sector. Specifically, shareholder-friendly corporate governance results in higher risk for larger banks and for banks that are located in countries with generous financial safety nets as banks try to shift risk toward taxpayers. We confirm our findings by comparing banks to nonfinancial firms and examining changes in bank risk around an exogenous regulatory change in governance. Our results underline the importance of the financial safety net and too-big-to-fail guarantees in thinking about corporate governance reforms at banks.","['Deniz Anginer', 'Asli Demirguc-Kunt', 'Harry Huizinga', 'Kebin Ma']","['Corporate governance', 'Bank insolvency', 'Systemic risk']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301715,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,2
Inefficiencies and externalities from opportunistic acquirers,"If opportunistic acquirers can buy targets using overvalued shares, then there is an inefficiency in the merger and acquisition (M&A) market: the most overvalued rather than the highest-synergy bidder may buy the target. We quantify this inefficiency using a structural estimation approach. We find that the M&A market allocates resources efficiently on average. Opportunistic bidders crowd out high-synergy bidders in only 7% of transactions, resulting in an average synergy loss equal to 9% of the target’s value in these inefficient deals. The implied average loss across all deals is 0.63%. Although the inefficiency is small on average, it is large for certain deals, and it is larger when misvaluation is more likely. Even when opportunistic bidders lose the contest, they drive up prices, imposing a large negative externality on the winning synergistic bidders.","['Di Li', 'Lucian A.

Playing favorites: Conflicts of interest in mutual fund management,"We examine the performance of mutual funds whose managers simultaneously manage portfolios with performance-based incentive fees for three account types: mutual funds, hedge funds, and separate accounts. Importantly, our data set is free of selection bias because it is hand-collected from mandatory SEC filings. We find that only funds whose managers also manage hedge funds significantly underperform peer mutual funds. Moreover, underperformance begins only after fund managers begin to manage a hedge fund. We find that managerial incentives and opportunities for cross-subsidization explain variation in underperformance across funds, supporting the conflicts of interest hypothesis in the debate on “side-by-side management.”","['Diane Del Guercio', 'Egemen Genç', 'Hai Tran']","['Conflicts of interest', 'Side-by-side management', 'Mutual funds', 'Hedge funds', 'Performance-based fees']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300710,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,3
Choosing factors,"Our goal is to develop insights about the maximum squared Sharpe ratio for model factors as a metric for ranking asset pricing models. We consider nested and non-nested models. The nested models are the capital asset pricing model, the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993), the five-factor extension in Fama and French (2015), and a six-factor model that adds a momentum factor. The non-nested models examine three issues about factor choice in the six-factor model: (1) cash profitability versus operating profitability as the variable used to construct profitability factors, (2) long-short spread factors versus excess return factors, and (3) factors that use small or big stocks versus factors that use both.","['Eugene F.

Determinants and consequences of information processing delay: Evidence from the Thomson Reuters Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System,"We present new evidence that highlights the role of information intermediaries in the distribution and processing of earnings estimates in capital markets. We find that the time taken to activate an analyst's earnings forecast in the Thomson Reuters Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System is related to measures of investor demand for timely information processing, processing difficulty, and limited attention. Furthermore, we find that forecast announcement returns are muted and post-announcement drift is magnified for forecasts with longer unexpected activation delay and that market inefficiency is concentrated in neglected stocks and potentially exploitable. Finally, analyzing intraday returns, we find that activations facilitate price discovery.","['Ferhat Akbas', 'Stanimir Markov', 'Musa Subasi', 'Eric Weisbrod']","['Information intermediaries', 'information processing', 'limited attention', 'information distribution', 'price discovery']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302933,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,2

"Competition, reach for yield, and money market funds","Do asset managers reach for yield because of competitive pressures in a low rate environment? I propose a tournament model of money market funds (MMFs) to study this question. When funds care about relative performance, an increase in the risk premium leads funds with lower default costs to increase risk taking, while funds with higher default costs decrease risk taking. Without changes in the premium, lower risk-free rates reduce the risk taking of all funds. I show that these predictions are consistent with MMF risk taking during the 2002–2008 period and that rank-based performance is a key determinant of money flows to MMFs.",['Gabriele La Spada'],"['Reach for yield', 'Money market funds', 'Flow-performance relation', 'Tournament', 'Monetary policy']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301004,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,129,1

The lower risk levels are largely due to diverse boards adopting more persistent and less risky financial policies. However, consistent with diversity fostering more efficient (real) risk-taking, firms with greater board diversity also invest persistently more in research and development (R&D) and have more efficient innovation processes. Instrumental variable tests that exploit exogenous variation in firm access to the supply of diverse nonlocal directors indicate that these relations are causal.","['Gennaro Bernile', 'Vineet Bhagwat', 'Scott Yonker']","['Diversity', 'Board of directors', 'Governance', 'Firm risk', 'Performance']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303215,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,3
Threat of entry and debt maturity: Evidence from airlines,"I explore the effect of the threat posed by low-cost competitors on debt structure in the airline industry. I use the route network expansion of low-cost airlines to identify routes where the probability of future entry increases dramatically. I find that when a large portion of their market is threatened, incumbents significantly increase debt maturity before entry occurs. Overall, the main findings suggest that airlines respond to entry threats trading off the benefits of short-term financing for lower rollover risk. The results are consistent with models in which firms set their optimal debt structure in the presence of costly rollover failure.",['Gianpaolo Parise'],"['Competition', 'Debt maturity', 'Rollover risk', 'Threat of entry']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302970,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,2
"Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks","Shadow bank market share in residential mortgage origination nearly doubled from 2007 to 2015, with particularly dramatic growth among online “fintech” lenders. We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden–capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision–all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14–16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders. A quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%.","['Greg Buchak', 'Gregor Matvos', 'Tomasz Piskorski', 'Amit Seru']","['Fintech', 'Shadow banks', 'Regulatory arbitrage', 'Lending', 'Mortgages', 'FHA']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1830237X,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,3
Financial market frictions and diversification,"We find new facts that relate the evolution of firm scope to the changing frictions in external capital markets over the last three decades. We find that large, diversified publicly traded firms increase their scope during times of high external capital market frictions, such as in the recent Great Recession. Moreover, during these times firms diversify their investment needs and cash flow across industries. We also find similar phenomena outside diversified public firms. Examining the mergers and acquisitions activity of stand-alone and diversified private firms, we uncover similar patterns. In aggregate data, we find that the composition of mergers shifts from focused to diversifying and back with changes in external market conditions. Our evidence is broadly consistent with the notion that firms diversify their scope in response to tightening in external capital markets.","['Gregor Matvos', 'Amit Seru', 'Rui C.

Capital gains taxation and the cost of capital: Evidence from unanticipated cross-border transfers of tax base,"In a cross-border takeover, the tax base associated with future capital gains is transferred from target shareholders to acquirer shareholders. Cross-country differences in capital gains tax rates enable us to estimate the discount in target valuation on account of future capital gains. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in the capital gains tax rate reduces the value of equity by around 0.3%, which suggests that the capital gains tax significantly raises firms’ cost of capital. Furthermore, we find that the implied capital gains tax burden is higher at times of high economic growth and low stock market valuation.","['Harry Huizinga', 'Johannes Voget', 'Wolf Wagner']","['Capital gains taxation', 'Cost of capital', 'International takeovers', 'Takeover premium']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301132,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,129,2

Pay me now (and later): Pension benefit manipulation before plan freezes and executive retirement,Large US firms modify top executives’ compensation before pension-related events. Top executives receive one-time increases in pensionable earnings through higher annual bonuses one year before a plan freeze and one year before retirement. Firms also boost pension payouts by lowering plan discount rates when top executives are eligible to retire with lump-sum benefit distributions. Increases in executive pensions do not appear to be an attempt to improve managerial effort or retention and are more likely to occur at firms with poor corporate governance.

We find causal evidence that regulators delay interventions before elections. The extent of the delay is larger for elected regulators than regulators appointed by the governor. Interventions by appointed regulators are less likely before competitive gubernatorial elections. Regulatory governance mechanisms that constrain the discretion of regulators reduce the delays of appointed regulators but not elected. Finally, we find evidence that suggests electoral delays increase the ultimate costs of failure.","['J. Tyler Leverty', 'Martin F.

Data abundance and asset price informativeness,"Information processing filters out the noise in data but it takes time. Hence, low precision signals are available before high precision signals. We analyze how this feature affects asset price informativeness when investors can acquire signals of increasing precision over time about the payoff of an asset. As the cost of low precision signals declines, prices are more likely to reflect these signals before more precise signals become available. This effect can ultimately reduce price informativeness because it reduces the demand for more precise signals (e.g., fundamental analysis). We make additional predictions for trade and price patterns.","['Jérôme Dugast', 'Thierry Foucault']","['Asset price informativeness', 'Big data', 'FinTech', 'Information processing', 'Markets for information']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301806,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,2
The Volcker Rule and corporate bond market making in times of stress,"Focusing on downgrades as stress events that drive the selling of corporate bonds, we show that the illiquidity of stressed bonds has increased after the Volcker Rule. Dealers regulated by the rule have curtailed their market-making activities and non-Volcker-affected dealers have not offset the decreased activities of Volcker-affected dealers. Furthermore, even Volcker-affected dealers that are not constrained by Basel III and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review regulations change their behavior, inconsistent with the effects being driven by these other regulations. Because Volcker-affected dealers have been the main liquidity providers, bonds have become less liquid during times of stress due to the Volcker Rule.","['Jack Bao', 'Maureen O’Hara', 'Xing (Alex) Zhou']","['Volcker Rule', 'Corporate bond illiquidity', 'Regulation', 'Capital commitment', 'Dealer inventory', 'Market making']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301491,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,1
Corporate debt maturity profiles,"We study a novel aspect of a firm’s capital structure, namely, the profile of its debt maturity dates. In a simple theoretical framework we show that the dispersion of debt maturities constitutes an important dimension of capital structure choice, driven by firm characteristics and debt rollover risk. Guided by these predictions we establish two main empirical results. First, using an exogenous shock to rollover risk, we document a significant increase in maturity dispersion for firms that need to roll over maturing debt. Second, we find strong support that maturities of newly issued debt are influenced by pre-existing maturity profiles.","['Jaewon Choi', 'Dirk Hackbarth', 'Josef Zechner']","['Capital structure', 'Debt structure', 'Debt maturity']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301855,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,3
Resaleable debt and systemic risk,"Many debt claims, such as bonds, are resaleable; others, such as repos, are not. There was a fivefold increase in repo borrowing before the 2008–2009 financial crisis. Why? Did banks’ dependence on non-resaleable debt precipitate the crisis? In this paper, we develop a model of bank lending with credit frictions. The key feature of the model is that debt claims are heterogenous in their resaleability. We find that decreasing credit market frictions leads to an increase in borrowing via non-resaleable debt. Such borrowing has a dark side: It causes credit chains to form, because, if a bank makes a loan via non-resaleable debt and needs liquidity, it cannot sell the loan but must borrow via a new contract. These credit chains are a source of systemic risk, as one bank’s default harms not only its creditors but also its creditors’ creditors. Overall, our model suggests that reducing credit market frictions may have an adverse effect on the financial system and even lead to the failures of financial institutions.","['Jason Roderick Donaldson', 'Eva Micheler']","['Resaleable debt', 'Systemic risk', 'Bankruptcy', 'Repos', 'Securities law']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303161,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,3
Warehouse banking,"We develop a theory of banking that explains why banks started out as commodities warehouses. We show that warehouses become banks because their superior storage technology allows them to enforce the repayment of loans most effectively. Further, interbank markets emerge endogenously to support this enforcement mechanism. Even though warehouses store deposits of real goods, they make loans by writing new fake warehouse receipts, rather than by taking deposits out of storage. Our theory helps to explain how modern banks create funding liquidity and why they combine warehousing (custody and deposit-taking), lending, and private money creation within the same institutions. It also casts light on a number of contemporary regulatory policies.","['Jason Roderick Donaldson', 'Giorgia Piacentino', 'Anjan Thakor']","['Banking', 'Private money', 'Financial history']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301107,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,129,2
Do an insider's wealth and income matter in the decision to engage in insider trading?,"We explore why insiders engage in informed trading, given the surprisingly small average insider returns reported in the literature and the potential costs involved. We begin by proposing a model of an insider's decision to engage in insider trading. We then empirically test the model's predictions using archival data of corporate insiders in Sweden. Consistent with the model, we find that less wealthy insiders are more likely to time their insider selling, and to sell in greater magnitudes, prior to abnormal price declines than wealthy insiders. We also find that less wealthy insiders with lower risk aversion as measured by their criminal behavior are particularly prone to timing their selling to avoid price declines.","['Jenni Kallunki', 'Juha-Pekka Kallunki', 'Henrik Nilsson', 'Mikko Puhakka']","['Insider trading', 'Wealth, Income']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301533,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,1
Absolving beta of volatility’s effects,"The beta anomaly, negative (positive) alpha on stocks with high (low) beta, arises from beta’s positive correlation with idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL). The relation between IVOL and alpha is positive among underpriced stocks but negative and stronger among overpriced stocks (Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan, 2015). That stronger negative relation combines with the positive IVOL-beta correlation to produce the beta anomaly. The anomaly is significant only within overpriced stocks and only in periods when the beta-IVOL correlation and the likelihood of overpricing are simultaneously high. Either controlling for IVOL or simply excluding overpriced stocks with high IVOL renders the beta anomaly insignificant.","['Jianan Liu', 'Robert F.

A spread portfolio that is long on stocks with high abnormal customer ratings and short on stocks with low abnormal customer ratings delivers an abnormal return of around 55.7 to 73.0 basis points per month. There is no evidence of return reversals in the subsequent year. The return predictability of customer ratings continues to hold after controlling for firm characteristics such as gross profitability, advertising, research and development expenses, and trading volume. Furthermore, abnormal customer ratings positively predict revenues and earnings surprises.

When several stocks experience simultaneous EPMs, HFT liquidity demand dominates their supply.

However, the maturity of startups that apply for funding (and are ultimately funded) inversely correlates with the entrepreneurship-friendliness of the country.

These results are particularly evident when institutions have multiple blockholdings in the same industry, when they have activism experience, or when they have long-term blockholdings in their portfolio firms.

By being intentionally overexposed to the idiosyncratic risk of their firms, overconfident CEOs exhibit a strong belief in their firms’ prospects. This belief attracts suppliers beyond the firm's observable expansionary corporate activities.

Human capital relatedness and mergers and acquisitions,"We construct a measure of the pairwise relatedness of firms’ human capital to examine whether human capital relatedness is a key factor in mergers and acquisitions. We find that mergers are more likely and merger returns and postmerger performance are higher when firms have related human capital. These relations are stronger or only present in acquisitions where the merging firms do not operate in the same industries or product markets. Reductions in employment and wages following mergers with high human capital relatedness suggest that the merged firm has greater ability to layoff low quality and/or duplicate employees and reduce labor costs. We further show in a falsification test that human capital relatedness has no effect on acquiring firm returns in asset sales when little or no labor is transferred, which helps validate our measure of human capital relatedness.","['Kyeong Hun Lee', 'David C.

This predictability, which is both statistically and economically significant, is stronger on more volatile days, on higher volume days, on recession days, and on major macroeconomic news release days.

Financing investment spikes in the years surrounding World War I⁎,"In the period surrounding World War I, US firms sharply increased investment in fixed assets and working capital to accommodate large increases in demand associated with the war. Concurrently, the US adopted an excess profits tax, which created a tax bias in favor of equity financing. Despite this tax bias, firms in need of external funds largely issued debt, not equity, to finance investment spikes when the excess profits tax was in effect. Further, we find these firms systematically reduced debt after the war, whereas other firms did not.

The main findings indicate that ambiguity in the equity market is priced. Introducing ambiguity alongside risk provides stronger evidence on the role of risk in explaining expected returns in the equity markets. The findings also indicate that investors’ level of aversion to or love for ambiguity is contingent on the expected probability of favorable returns.","['Menachem Brenner', 'Yehuda Izhakian']","['Ambiguity aversion', 'Ambiguity measurement', 'Knightian uncertainty', 'Equity premium']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301831,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,3
Cost of experimentation and the evolution of venture capital,"We study how technological shocks to the cost of starting new businesses have led the venture capital model to adapt in fundamental ways over the prior decade. We both document and provide a framework to understand the changes in the investment strategy of venture capitalists (VCs) in recent years – an increased prevalence of a “spray and pray” investment approach – where investors provide a little funding and limited governance to an increased number of startups that they are more likely to abandon, but where initial experiments significantly inform beliefs about the future potential of the venture. This adaptation and related entry by new financial intermediaries has led to a disproportionate rise in innovations where information on future prospects is revealed quickly and cheaply, and reduced the relative share of innovation in complex technologies where initial experiments cost more and reveal less.","['Michael Ewens', 'Ramana Nanda', 'Matthew Rhodes-Kropf']","['Innovation', 'Venture capital', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Investing', 'Abandonment options']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300631,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,3
Cash flow duration and the term structure of equity returns,"The term structure of equity returns is downward-sloping: stocks with high cash flow duration earn 1.10% per month lower returns than short-duration stocks in the cross-section. I create a measure of cash flow duration at the firm level using balance sheet data to show this novel fact. Factor models can explain only 50% of the return differential, and the difference in returns is three times larger after periods of high investor sentiment. Analysts extrapolate from past earnings growth into the future and predict high returns for high-duration stocks following high-sentiment periods, contrary to ex-post realizations. I use institutional ownership as a proxy for short-sale constraints, and find the negative cross-sectional relationship between cash flow duration and returns is only contained within short-sale constrained stocks.",['Michael Weber'],"['Dividend strips', 'Short-sale constraints', 'Anomalies', 'Sentiment']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300667,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,3

This empirical evidence indicates that fund alpha and fund size are not independent entities. Consequently, skill, rather than being measured by the fund alpha, should be measured by the value that a fund extracts from capital markets.

How does the stock market absorb shocks?,"Using a comprehensive set of news stories, we find a stark difference in market responses to positive and negative price shocks accompanied by new information. When there is a news story about a firm, positive price shocks are followed by reversal, while negative ones result in drift. This is interpreted as the stock market overreaction to good news and underreaction to bad news. These seemingly contradictory results can be explained in a single framework, considering the interaction of retail investors with attention bias, and arbitrageurs with short-run capital constraints. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that both patterns are stronger when the attention bias is stronger, and when the arbitrage capital is scarce.","['Murray Z.

Extrapolation and bubbles,"We present an extrapolative model of bubbles. In the model, many investors form their demand for a risky asset by weighing two signals—an average of the asset’s past price changes and the asset’s degree of overvaluation—and “waver” over time in the relative weight they put on them. The model predicts that good news about fundamentals can trigger large price bubbles, that bubbles will be accompanied by high trading volume, and that volume increases with past asset returns.

Spillovers from good-news and other bankruptcies: Real effects and price responses,"We model debt restructurings that could endogenously end in bankruptcy, and study spillovers to competitors’ operating decisions, profits, restructuring outcomes and security prices. We show that while bankruptcy could cause the firm’s share price to drop, bankruptcy always signals good news about the firm. We identify the conditions under which a bankruptcy also signals good news about competitors. We demonstrate that when a firm’s bankruptcy costs are relatively small, bankruptcy raises its share price while lowering the prices of competitors’ shares and debt as well as boosting the probability that they will enter bankruptcy. When there is little information asymmetry about the firm’s prospects, or the information asymmetry is about industry prospects, bankruptcy raises competitors’ share and debt prices and lowers their probability of bankruptcy.","['Nina Baranchuk', 'Michael J.

Leverage constraints and asset prices: Insights from mutual fund risk taking,"Prior theory suggests that time variation in the degree to which leverage constraints bind affects the pricing kernel. We propose a measure for this leverage constraint tightness by inverting the argument that constrained investors tilt their portfolios to riskier assets. We show that the average market beta of actively managed mutual funds—intermediaries facing leverage restrictions—captures their desire for leverage and thus the tightness of constraints. Consistent with theory, it strongly predicts returns of the betting-against-beta portfolio, and is a priced risk factor in the cross-section of mutual funds and stocks. Funds with low exposure to the factor outperform high-exposure funds by 5% annually, and for stocks this difference reaches 7%. Our results show that the tightness of leverage constraints has important implications for asset prices.","['Oliver Boguth', 'Mikhail Simutin']","['Leverage constraints', 'Asset prices', 'Betting-against-beta', 'Mutual fund performance', 'Cross-section of stock returns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17303124,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,2
Disagreement about inflation and the yield curve,"We show that inflation disagreement, not just expected inflation, has an impact on nominal interest rates. In contrast to expected inflation, which mainly affects the wedge between real and nominal yields, inflation disagreement affects nominal yields predominantly through its impact on the real side of the economy. We show theoretically and empirically that inflation disagreement raises real and nominal yields and their volatilities. Inflation disagreement is positively related to consumers’ cross-sectional consumption growth volatility and trading in fixed income securities. Calibrating our model to disagreement, inflation, and yields reproduces the economically significant impact of inflation disagreement on yield curves.","['Paul Ehling', 'Michael Gallmeyer', 'Christian Heyerdahl-Larsen', 'Philipp Illeditsch']","['Inflation disagreement', 'Real and nominal yields', 'Yield volatilities', 'Cross-sectional consumption growth volatility', 'Speculative trade']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300011,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,3
Does improved information improve incentives?,"This paper studies the value of more precise signals on agent performance in an optimal contracting model with endogenous effort. With limited liability, the agent’s wage is increasing in output only if output exceeds a threshold, else it is zero regardless of output. If the threshold is sufficiently high, the agent only beats it, and is rewarded for increasing output through greater effort, if there is a high noise realization. Thus, a fall in output volatility reduces effort incentives—information and effort are substitutes—offsetting the standard effect that improved information lowers the cost of compensation. We derive conditions relating the incentive effect to the underlying parameters of the agency problem.","['Pierre Chaigneau', 'Alex Edmans', 'Daniel Gottlieb']","['Executive compensation', 'Limited liability', 'Options', 'Risk management', 'Relative performance evaluation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301260,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,2
Carry,"We apply the concept of carry, which has been studied almost exclusively in currency markets, to any asset. A security’s expected return is decomposed into its “carry,” an ex-ante and model-free characteristic, and its expected price appreciation. Carry predicts returns cross-sectionally and in time series for a host of different asset classes, including global equities, global bonds, commodities, US Treasuries, credit, and options. Carry is not explained by known predictors of returns from these asset classes, and it captures many of these predictors, providing a unifying framework for return predictability. We reject a generalized version of Uncovered Interest Parity and the Expectations Hypothesis in favor of models with varying risk premia, in which carry strategies are commonly exposed to global recession, liquidity, and volatility risks, though none fully explains carry’s premium.","['Ralph S.J.

Non-rating revenue and conflicts of interest,"Rating agencies produce ratings used by investors, but obtain most of their revenue from issuers, leading to a conflict of interest. We employ a unique data set on the use of non-rating services, and the associated payments, in India, to test if this conflict affects ratings quality. Agencies rate issuers that pay them for non-rating services higher (than agencies not hired for such services). Such issuers also have higher default rates. Both effects are increasing in the amount paid. These results suggest that issuers which hire agencies for non-rating services receive higher ratings despite having higher default risk.

While FOFs focusing on buyouts outperform public markets, they underperform direct fund investment strategies in buyout. In contrast, the average performance of FOFs in venture capital is on a par with results from direct venture fund investing.

Busy directors and firm performance: Evidence from mergers,"This paper studies whether director appointments to multiple boards impact firm outcomes. To overcome endogeneity of board appointments, I exploit variation generated by mergers that terminate entire boards and thus shock the appointments of those terminated directors. Reductions of board appointments are associated with higher profitability, market-to-book, and likelihood of directors joining board committees. The performance gains are particularly stark when directors are geographically far from firm headquarters. I conclude that the effect of the shocks to board appointments is: (i) evidence that boards matter; and (ii) plausibly explained by a workload channel: when directors work less elsewhere, their companies benefit.",['Roie Hauser'],"['Board of directors', 'Board composition', 'Busy boards', 'Corporate governance']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300230,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,1

We reject the hypothesis that firms’ default times are correlated only because their conditional default rates depend on observable and latent systematic factors. By contrast, we find strong evidence that contagion, through which the default by one firm has a direct impact on the health of other firms, is a significant clustering source. The amount of clustering that cannot be explained by contagion and firms’ exposure to observable and latent systematic factors is insignificant. Our results have important implications for the pricing and management of correlated default risk.","['S Azizpour', 'K. Giesecke', 'G.

Divergence of a company's peer-implied value estimate from its market value represents mispricing, motivating a convergence trade that earns risk-adjusted returns of up to 10% per year and is economically significant for both large and small cap firms.

We find evidence consistent with a causal relation by exploiting unexpected changes in the value of unvested options. A large fraction of the reduction in turnover appears to be temporary with turnover increasing in the third year following the year of the adoption of the BBSO plan. The increase three years post-grant is equal in magnitude to the cumulative decrease in turnover over the three prior years, suggesting that long-vesting BBSO plans delay, instead of prevent, turnover.","['Serdar Aldatmaz', 'Paige Ouimet', 'Edward D Van Wesep']","['Employee stock options', 'Turnover']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730257X,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,127,1
The unintended consequences of divestment,"A divestment campaign aims to depress share prices to induce managers to change firm behavior. Assuming that managers make profit-maximizing decisions in the absence of a campaign, firms that accede to divestors’ demands raise short-run share prices but depress long-run profits. Managers who are more interested in short-run prices are therefore more motivated by divestment than managers who care about long-run profits. We show that, as most managerial compensation contracts reward long-run profitability and stock returns, divestment can be ineffective at best, and perhaps counterproductive, rewarding managers who attract divestment campaigns. In a quantification exercise, we show that the wealth of most executives running likely divestment targets in 2015 would be unaffected by even large movements in share prices.

This positive role of relationship lending is stronger for small and opaque firms and in regions with a more severe economic downturn.

With disagreement about default correlation, low-correlation investors believe in diversification and pay high prices for senior tranches they deem riskless. High-correlation investors value junior tranches they expect to pay whenever aggregate conditions are good.

A three-regime specification is estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM). Model moments match their empirical counterparts for a variety of unconditional moments, including the equity premium, stock returns volatility, and the correlations between stock returns and consumption and dividends. Dynamic features of the data, such as the countercyclical behaviors of the equity premium and volatility, are also captured. Model volatility provides a good fit for realized volatility. A new factor, the information risk premium, is found to be a strong predictor of future excess returns.

Alpha or beta in the eye of the beholder: What drives hedge fund flows?,"Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) alpha explains hedge fund flows better than alphas from more sophisticated models. This suggests that investors pool together sophisticated model alpha with returns from exposures to traditional (except for the market) and exotic risks. We decompose performance into traditional and exotic risk components and find that while investors chase both components, they place greater relative emphasis on returns associated with exotic risk exposures that can only be obtained through hedge funds. However, we find little evidence of persistence in performance from traditional or exotic risks, which cautions against investors’ practice of seeking out risk exposures following periods of recent success.","['Vikas Agarwal', 'T.

The effects of media slant on firm behavior,The media can impose reputational costs on firms because of its important role as an information intermediary and its ability to negatively slant coverage. We exploit a quasi-natural experiment that holds constant the information event across firms but varies the availability of a major news outlet in local markets. We find that firms subject to the threat of slanted coverage suppress the release of negative information before the event and release it subsequently. Our results are consistent with theory on the active role firms can play in managing their reputational capital through anticipatory actions to avoid negative media coverage.,"['Vishal P.

"Bid anticipation, information revelation, and merger gains","Because firms’ takeover motives are unobservable to investors, mergers are only partially anticipated and often appear as mixed blessings for acquirers. I construct and estimate a model to study the causes and consequences of bid anticipation and information revelation in mergers. Controlling for the market’s reassessment of the acquirer’s stand-alone value, I estimate that acquirers gain 4% from a typical merger. The total value of an active merger market averages 13% for acquirers, part of which is capitalized in their pre-merger market values. My model also explains the correlation between announcement returns and firm characteristics, as well as the low predictability of mergers.",['Wenyu Wang'],"['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Revelation', 'Anticipation', 'Merger gains']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300497,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,2
Financing as a supply chain: The capital structure of banks and borrowers,"We develop a model of the joint capital structure decisions of banks and their borrowers. Bank leverage of 85% or higher emerges because bank seniority both dramatically reduces bank asset volatility and incentivizes risk-taking by producing a skewed return distribution. Nonfinancial firms choose low leverage to protect their banks, presenting a partial resolution to the low-leverage puzzle. Our setup naturally extends to include government actions as we model bank assets using a modified Basel framework. Deposit insurance and bailout expectations lead banks and borrowers to take on more risk. Capital regulation lowers bank leverage but can increase bank risk due to a compensating increase in borrower leverage. Despite this, doubling current capital requirements reduces bank default risk by up to 90%, with only a small increase in loan interest rates.","['Will Gornall', 'Ilya A.

Creditor rights and innovation: Evidence from patent collateral,"I show that patents are pledged as collateral to raise significant debt financing, and that the pledgeability of patents contributes to the financing of innovation. In 2013, 38% of US patenting firms had previously pledged patents as collateral, and these firms performed 20% of research and development expense and patenting in Compustat. Employing court decisions as a source of exogenous variation in creditor rights, I show that patenting companies raised more debt, and spent more on R&D, when creditor rights to patents strengthened. Subsequently, these companies exhibited a gradual increase in patenting output and the use of patents as collateral.",['William Mann'],"['Patents', 'Innovation', 'Corporate investment', 'Law and finance']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301776,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,1
Momentum in Imperial Russia,"Some of the leading theories of momentum have different empirical predictions that depend on market composition and structure. The institutional theory predicts lower momentum profits in markets with less agency. Behavioral theories predict lower profits in markets with more sophisticated investors. In this paper, we use a dataset from a major 19th century equity market to test these predictions. We find no evidence to support the institutional theory due to the lack of delegated management. We exploit a regulatory change in the middle of our sample period to test behavioral theories. We find evidence consistent with overreaction theories of momentum.","['William N.

"Investment, Tobin’s q, and interest rates","We study the impact of stochastic interest rates and capital illiquidity on investment and firm value by incorporating a widely used arbitrage-free term structure model of interest rates into a standard q theoretic framework. Our generalized q model informs us to use corporate credit-risk information to predict investments when empirical measurement issues of Tobin’s average q are significant (e.g., equity is much more likely to be mis-priced than debt), as in Philippon (2009). We find, consistent with our theory, that credit spreads and bond q have significant predictive powers on micro-level and aggregate investments corroborating the recent empirical work of Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012). We also show that the quantitative effects of the stochastic interest rates and capital illiquidity on investment, Tobin’s average q, the duration and user cost of capital, and the value of growth opportunities are substantial. These findings are particularly important in today’s low interest rate environment.","['Xiaoji Lin', 'Chong Wang', 'Neng Wang', 'Jinqiang Yang']","['Term structure of interest rates', 'Capital adjustment costs', 'Assets in place', 'Growth opportunities', 'Bond q']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301028,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,3
Can financial innovation succeed by catering to behavioral preferences? Evidence from a callable options market,"We examine the notion that financial products which cater to investors’ behavioral biases can yield high trading activity and thus be profitable for issuers. Our setting considers options with a callback feature, namely, callable bull/bear contracts (CBBCs). Such contracts have high skewness when close to callback and thus appeal to cumulative prospect theory preferences. CBBCs with high skewness earn negative average returns, and issuers’ gross profits vary positively with CBBC skewness. Over the 2009–2014 period, issuers earn gross profits of about $1.67 billion by trading CBBCs on the Hang Seng Index. These findings highlight the role of behavioral finance in financial innovation.","['Xindan Li', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam', 'Xuewei Yang']","['Lotteries', 'Gambling', 'Financial innovation', 'Cumulative prospect theory', 'Callable bull/bear contract (CBBC)']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300242,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,1
"Patent collateral, investor commitment, and the market for venture lending","We explore the market for lending to start-ups and two mechanisms that facilitate trade within it: (1) the salability of patent collateral and (2) the credible commitment of equity investors. Intensified trading in the secondary patent market is strongly related to lending, particularly for start-ups with more redeployable patent assets. Utilizing the crash of 2000 as a severe and unexpected capital supply shock for venture capitalists, we further show that lenders continue to finance start-ups with recently funded investors better able to credibly commit to refinance their portfolio companies while withdrawing from otherwise promising projects that could have needed their funds the most.","['Yael V.

Cyclical investment behavior across financial institutions,"This paper contrasts the investment behavior of different financial institutions in debt securities as a response to past returns. For identification, I use unique security-level data from the German Microdatabase Securities Holdings Statistics. Banks and investment funds respond in a procyclical manner to past security-specific holding period returns. In contrast, insurance companies and pension funds act countercyclically; they buy when returns have been negative and sell after high returns. The heterogeneous responses can be explained by differences in their balance sheet structure. I exploit within-sector variation in the financial constraint to show that tighter constraints are associated with relatively more procyclical investment behavior.",['Yannick Timmer'],"['Portfolio allocation', 'Investment behavior', 'Financial markets', 'Debt securities', 'Balance sheet constraints']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301119,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,129,2
Micro(structure) before macro? The predictive power of aggregate illiquidity for stock returns and economic activity,"This paper constructs and analyzes various measures of trading costs in US equity markets covering the period 1926–2015. These measures contain statistically and economically significant predictive signals for stock market returns and real economic activity. We decompose illiquidity proxies into a component capturing aggregate volatility and a residual. The predictive content of these components differs in important ways. Specifically, we find strong evidence that the component of illiquidity uncorrelated with volatility forecasts stock market returns. Both the volatility and residual components of illiquidity contain information regarding future economic activity.","['Yong Chen', 'Gregory W. Eaton', 'Bradley S.

One fundamental and two taxes: When does a Tobin tax reduce financial price volatility?,"We aim to make two contributions to the literature on the effects of transaction costs on financial price volatility. First, by augmenting a double differencing approach with a research design with three ingredients (a common set of companies simultaneously listed on two stock exchanges, binding capital controls, and different timing of changes in transaction costs), we obtain a control group that has identical corporate fundamentals as the treatment group. We apply the research design to Chinese stocks that are cross-listed in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Second, we allow transaction costs to have different effects in markets with different maturity. We find a significantly negative relationship, on average, between stamp duty increase and price volatility. However, this average effect masks some important heterogeneity. In particular, when institutional investors have become a significant part of the traders’ pool, we find an opposite effect. Overall, our results suggest that a Tobin tax could work in an immature market, but can backfire in a more developed market.","['Yongheng Deng', 'Xin Liu', 'Shang-Jin Wei']","['Tobin tax', 'Transaction cost', 'Volatility', 'Speculation', 'Limits to arbitrage']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18301089,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,130,3
Quantitative easing auctions of Treasury bonds,"The Federal Reserve uses (reverse) auctions to implement its purchases of Treasury bonds in quantitative easing (QE). To evaluate dealers’ offers across multiple bonds, the Fed relies on its internal yield curve model, fitted to secondary market bond prices. From November 2010 to September 2011, a one standard deviation increase in the cheapness of a Treasury bond (how much the market price of the bond is below a model-implied value) increases the Fed’s purchase quantity of that bond by 276 million and increases the auction costs on that bond by 2.6 cents per $100 par value, controlling for standard covariates. Our results suggest that the Fed harvests gains from trades by purchasing undervalued bonds, but strategic dealers extract some profits because the Fed’s relative values can be partly inferred from price data.","['Zhaogang Song', 'Haoxiang Zhu']","['Quantitative easing', 'Auction', 'Treasury bond', 'Federal Reserve']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X18300436,Journal of Financial Economics,2018,128,1
