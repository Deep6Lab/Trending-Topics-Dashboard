The journal of financial economics,"Data for the 516 papers published in volumes 1–30 of the Journal of Financial Economics in the period 1974–91 are analyzed. 477 authors from 136 institutions contributed papers, and these papers received 16,231 citations according to the Social Science Citation Index. Lists of authors and institutions who have contributed the most papers to the JFE and a list of the mostly highly-cited JFE papers show why the Journal has been successful in influencing the finance and economics literature during its first 18 years.",['G.William Schwert'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9390012Z,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,33,3
"Trading volume, management solicitation, and shareholder voting","In an investigation of possible relationships between shareholder voting turnout, trading volume after the record data, and the intervals between the record and meeting dates, we find that higher trading volume and more trading days between the record date and the receipt of proxy materials both reduce voting turnout. A longer interval between the receipt of proxy materials and the meeting increases turnout, as does greater solicitation expense. Our tests show that management mails proxies further in advance of the meeting when its proposals require a majority of shares outstanding, as opposed to votes cast, for approval.","['Philip J.

The international market for corporate control,"Japanese mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. create statistically significant wealth gains for both Japanese bidders and U.S. targets. Consistent with the literature on foreign direct investment and the market for corporate control, bidder-specific characteristics and exchange-rate movements are useful in explaining the cross-sectional variation in bidder returns: returns to Japanese bidders and to the portfolio of Japanese bidders and U.S. targets increase with the bidder's leverage, the bidder's ties to financial institutions through borrowings, and the depreciation of the dollar in relation to the Japanese yen.",['Jun-Koo Kang'],"['Japanese mergers and acquisitions', 'Monitoring', 'Exchange-rate movement', 'Bidder return']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900316,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,3
"The winner's curse, legal liability, and the long-run price performance of initial public offerings in Finland","Rationing data for initial public offerings (IPOs) in the Finnish market make possible a test of Rock's (1986) winner's curse hypothesis. The evidence from 80 IPOs issued between 1984 and 1989 confirms the presence of the winner's curse: average returns adjusted for the bias in allocation are lower than average unadjusted returns. But the initial returns of these IPOs appear unrelated to lawsuit avoidance, as the sample firms seem unlikely to incur legal liabilities. In the long run, consistent with the evidence in the United States, the IPO firms substantially underperform the Helsinki Stock Exchange value-weighted index.",['Matti Keloharju'],"['Initial public offerings', 'Legal liability', 'Long-run performance', ""Winner's curse""]",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9390020C,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,2
NYSE vs NASDAQ returns,"Reinganum (1990) reports that small NYSE securities have average returns about 6% per year higher than those of similarly-sized NASDAQ securities during the 1973–1988 period. He attributes the return differential to market microstructure differences. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that differences in the characteristics of the companies listed on the two exchanges explain much of the disparity. About 60% of the return differential can be attributed to the poor performance of recent initial public offerings, which comprise a large portion of the firms on NASDAQ. On average, IPOs underperform during the six calendar years after going public.",['Tim Loughran'],[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9390006W,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,33,2
An empirical investigation of IPO returns and subsequent equity offerings,"Several recent papers present signaling models in which firms underprice their initial public offerings of equity (IPOs) so that they can subsequently issue seasoned equity at more favorable prices. We test the implications of these models. We find a positive relation between IPO underpricing and the probability and size of subsequent seasoned offerings. Although these results are consistent with the implications of the signaling hypotheses, the economic significance appears weak. We conduct additional tests to evaluate other explanations for these findings and find the alternatives more compelling.","['Narasimhan Jegadeesh', 'Mark Weinstein', 'Ivo Welch']","['IPO underpricing', 'Market-feedback hypothesis', 'Seasoned equity offering', 'Signaling hypothesis']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900165,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,2
Private benefits from block ownership and discounts on closed-end funds,"The greater the managerial stock ownership in closed-end funds, the larger are the discounts to net asset value. The average discount for funds with blockholders is 14%, whereas the average discount for funds without blockholders is only 4%. This relation is robust over time and to various model specifications that control for other factors that affect discounts. We argue that blockholders receive private benefits that do not accrue to other shareholders and that they veto open-ending proposals to preserve these benefits. We support this argument by documenting a range of potential private benefits received by blockholders in closed-end funds.","['Michael J. Barclay', 'Clifford G.

Positive information from equity issue announcements,"The Myers and Majluf (1984) model predicts a nonpositive price reaction to an announcement of a new issue of equity. This paper shows that the Myers and Majluf result is a direct outcome of their assumption that all potential projects facing the firm have a nonnegative net present value. Refining the Myers and Majluf model, by allowing for the realistic possibility of potential projects having negative net present values, leads to different predictions. The refined model predicts positive as well as negative stock price responses, consistent with recent empirical evidence concerning the stock price effects of new stock issues.","['John W.

The hidden costs of stock market liquidity,"The seemingly unrelated problems of stock market liquidity and manager-stockholder contracting are closely intertwined. Active stockholders who reduce agency costs by providing internal monitoring also reduce stock liquidity by creating information asymmetry problems. Conversely, stock liquidity discourages internal monitoring by reducing the costs of ‘exit’ of unhappy stockholders. The U.S. has exceptionally many actively-traded firms with widely-diffused stockholding because public policy has favored stock market liquidity over active investing. And, the benefits of stock market liquidity must be weighed against the costs of impaired corporate governance.",['Amar Bhide'],[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9390039E,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,1
Corporate governance through the proxy process,"This paper analyzes a proxy solicitation and subsequent restructuring at Honeywell Inc. in 1989. The solicitation was financed and led by noninstitutional investors and co-sponsored by two public pension funds. The solicitation and restructuring both appear to increase firm value, though the effects of the restructuring are much larger. The voting records of Honeywell's 72 largest institutional shareholders reveal that banks and insurance companies are significantly more supportive of two management-sponsored antitakeover proposals than public pension funds add independent investment managers. Existing business ties between Honeywell and its institutional investors, however, do not appear to explain these voting differences.",['Karen Van Nuys'],[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9390042A,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,1
An empirical study of the Mexican Treasury bill auction,This paper analyzes bidding behavior in Mexican Treasury bill auctions for the period 1986–1991. The Mexican auction rules resemble those used in U.S. Treasury bill auctions closely. Results suggest the presence of collusion among large bidders throughout a large portion of the sampling period and the presence of information asymmetries between small and large bidders. Results also suggest that bidders account for the winner's curse and that participants bid more cautiously when uncertainty is high. Bidders' profits fell dramatically in 1990 when the Treasury substituted uniform for discriminatory pricing to combat collusion and to increase auction revenues.,['Steven R.

Is the ex ante risk premium always positive?,"This paper develops tests of inequality restrictions implied by conditional asset pricing models. The methodology is easy to implement, requires little knowledge of the conditional distribution of asset returns, and is valid under fairly weak assumptions. As an application, we test whether the ex ante risk premium is always positive. We report reliable evidence that the ex ante risk premium is negative in some states of the world; these states are related to periods of high expected inflation and especially to downward-sloping term structures.","['Jacob Boudoukh', 'Matthew Richardson', 'Tom Smith']","['Ex ante risk premium', 'Inequality restrictions', 'Conditional asset pricing models']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900338,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,3
The underpricing of initial public offerings and the partial adjustment phenomenon,"This paper documents that the relation of the final offer price to the range of anticipated offer prices disclosed in the preliminary prospectus is a good predictor of initial returns. Issues that have final offer prices which exceed the limits of the offer range have greater underpricing than all other initial public offerings, and are also more likely to increase the number of shares issued. These results are consistent with the pricing and allocation schedule proposed by Benveniste and Spindt (1989), in which shares in an offering are rationed and prices only partially adjust to new information.",['Kathleen Weiss Hanley'],"['IPOs', 'Partial adjustment', 'Underpricing']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900198,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,2
The seasonal behavior of the liquidity premium in asset pricing,"This paper empirically investigates the seasonal behavior of the liquidity premium in asset pricing. The evidence suggests a strong seasonal component. In the 1961–1990 period, the liquidity premium is reliably positive only during the month of January. For the non-January months, one cannot detect a positive liquidity premium. The impact of the relative bid-ask spreads on asset pricing in non-January months cannot be reliably distinguished from zero. In contrast to Amihud and Mendelson (1986), however, our evidence suggests that the size effect is significant, even after controlling for spreads.","['Venkat R. Eleswarapu', 'Marc R.

The information content of distressed restructurings involving public and private debt claims,"This paper examines debt restructurings by financially distressed firms. We develop a model which predicts that, in public debt exchange offers, firms with unfavorable private information will offer equity claims to convince bondholders that the firm's prospects are poor. In contrast, offering equity to well-informed private lenders conveys favorable private information to outsiders. Consistent with our analysis, we find positive average abnormal returns around restructurings that offer equity to private lenders and senior debt to public debtholders, and we find significant negative average abnormal returns when private lenders are offered senior debt and public lenders are offered equity.","['David T.

Investments of uncertain cost,"This paper examines irreversible investment decisions when projects take time to complete and are subject to two types of cost uncertainty. The first is technical uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty over the physical difficulty of completing a project, which is only resolved as the investment proceeds. The second is input cost uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty over the prices of construction inputs or over government regulations affecting construction costs, which is external to the firm. These two types of uncertainty have very different effects on the investment decision. A simple investment rule is derived that maximizes firm value, and is used to analyze the decision to start or continue building a nuclear power plant during the 1980s.",['Robert S.

Institutional trades and intraday stock price behavior,"This paper examines the price effect of institutional stock trading, using a unique data set that reports the transactions (large and small) of 37 large institutional money management firms. The direction of each trade and the identity of the management firm behind each trade are known. Although institutional trades are associated with some price pressure, we find that the average effect is small. There is also a marked asymmetry between the price impact of buys versus sells. We relate our findings to various hypotheses on the elasticity of demand for stocks, the cost of executing transactions, and the determinants of market impact. Although market capitalization and relative trade size influence the market impact of a trade, the dominant influence is the identity of the money manager behind the trade.","['Louis K.C.

Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds,"This paper identifies five common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds. There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors, related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important, the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.","['Eugene F. Fama', 'Kenneth R.

Portfolio return autocorrelation,"This paper investigates whether portfolio return autocorrelation can be explained by time-varying expected returns, nontrading, state limit orders, market maker inventory policy, or transaction costs. Evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that transaction costs cause portfolio autocorrelation by slowing price adjustment. I develop a transaction-cost model which predicts that prices adjust faster when changes in valuation are large in relation to the bid-ask spread. Cross-sectional tests support this prediction, but time-series tests do not.",['Timothy S.

Seniority and maturity of debt contracts,"This paper provides a model of how borrowers with private information about their credit prospects choose seniority and maturity of debt. Increased short-term debt leads lenders to liquidate too often. It also increases the sensitivity of financing costs to new information, although better-than-average borrowers desire information sensitivity. The model implies that short-term debt will be senior to long-term debt, and that long-term debt will allow the issue of additional future senior debt. The model also has implications on the structure of leveraged buyouts and on how various types of lenders respond to potential defaults.",['Douglas W.

Underwriter price support and the IPO underpricing puzzle,"This paper reassesses the apparent systematic underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs). Investigation of the distribution of initial returns following IPOs shows that positive mean initial returns may reflect the existence of a partially unobserved left (negative) tail. Moreover, most IPOs with zero one-day returns subsequently fall in price, suggesting that underwriter price support may account for the skewed distribution and hence the phenomenon of positive average initial IPO returns, even if offering prices are set at expected market value. This paper thus challenges the presumption underlying previous research that positive average initial IPO returns result primarily from deliberate underpricing.",['Judith S Ruud'],"['Initial public offerings', 'IPO underpricing', 'Price support', 'Stabilization']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900154,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,2
Another look at time-varying risk and return in a long-horizon contrarian strategy,"This paper reconciles the relative pricing controversy between DeBondt and Thaler (1985, 1987), Chan (1988), and Ball and Kothari (1989). The negative autocorrelation in long-horizon index returns, along with the selection criterion of the contrarian strategy, can explain the positive covariance between time-varying betas and risk premiums. However, test-period beta estimates reflect the reversal of earnings expectations associated with underlying factors. The controversy thus reduces to the debate of Fama and French (1988) and Poterba and Summers (1988) over the source of the temporary price components in the market index. Rational changes in expected returns and cash flows explain most of the cross-sectional variation in returns.",['Steven L.

Transaction taxes and the behavior of the Swedish stock market,"This paper studies the effects of transaction taxes on the behavior of Swedish equity returns during the 1980–1987 period. Sweden provides an excellent laboratory-style setting for such a study, as taxes were imposed for political purposes rather than to alter the behavior of the stock market. Volatility did not decline in response to the introduction of taxes although stock price levels and turnover did. Large proportions of trading activity migrated overseas to London when the tax rate was increased to 2% in 1986.",['Steven R.

Capital structure and firm response to poor performance,"This paper tests the relation between capital structure and a firm's response to short-term financial distress. In a sample of 358 firms that perform poorly for a year, higher predistress leverage increases the probability of operational actions, particularly asset restructuring and employee layoffs. Higher predistress leverage also increases the probability of financial actions such as dividend cuts. These results are consistent with Jensen's (1989) argument that higher predistress leverage increases the speed with which a firm reacts to poor performance. Interestingly, higher managerial holdings reduce the probability of operational actions, especially those that do not generate cash.",['Eli Ofek'],[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9390038D,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,1
Price stabilization in the market for new issues,"This study examines price stabilization in new equity issues. Stabilizationtruncates the distribution of post-issue prices at a floor price, lowering the risk of adverse price moves and hence, in a competitive dealer market, reducing the bid-ask spread. Using 1.523 NASDAO-traded firm- commitment initial public offerings issued between 1982 and 1987, we find that spreads narrow when the market price is close to the offer price and stabilization is most likely. Moreover, significant negative returns are documented after the hypothesized termination of stabilizing activities, suggesting that stabilization, and its cessation, affect market prices.","['Kathleen Weiss Hanley', 'A.Arun Kumar', 'Paul J Seguin']","['Initial public offerings', 'Bid-ask spreads', 'Microstructure', 'Options pricing']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900176,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,2
Unit initial public offerings,"Units are bundles of common stock and warrants. By selling initial public offerings (IPOs) of units, firms precommit to sell more stock in the future at the warrant's exercise price. Sequential offerings of this type reduce the agency costs of giving management a potential free cash flow at the IPO. Consistent with this theory, firms that choose unit IPOs are smaller, have less income and assets in relation to their IPO proceeds, and are less likely to survive than firms that issue shares.",['Paul Schultz'],"['Initial public offerings', 'Agency costs', 'Warrants']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900187,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,2
Interest rate swaps,"Using quotations from two interest rate swap dealers with different credit ratings (AAA and A), we examine the effect of dealers' credit reputations on swap quotations and bid-offer spreads. The AAA offer rates are significantly higher than the A offer rates, and the AAA bid rates are significantly lower than the A bid rates. We also document the relation between swap rates and par bond yields estimated from London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and bid rate (LIBID) data. We identify some of the problems in testing the implications of swap pricing theory.","['Tong-sheng Sun', 'Suresh Sundaresan', 'Ching Wang']",[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X93900419,Journal of Financial Economics,1993,34,1
Measuring security price performance using daily NASDAQ returns,"We evaluate the performance of alternative test statistics in event studies which include NASDAQ daily security returns. We document varying degrees of test statistic misspecification in NASDAQ samples. In particular, we find that the commonly used standardized test statistic is misspecified in most settings. Although less pervasive, misspecification is also evident in the portfolio test statistic estimated using the time series of portfolio mean abnormal returns. The nonparametric rank statistic [introduced in Corrado (1989)] performs the best overall in NASDAQ samples; we recommend its use with market model abnormal returns based on an equal-weighted NASDAQ market index.","['Cynthia J.

A reexamination of analysts' earnings forecasts for takeover targets,"We examine analysts' earnings forecasts for a sample of takeover targets and document that the announcement-month forecasts are systematically revised upward, supporting the hypothesis that a takeover announcement conveys favorable information about the target firm. In addition, we find that abnormal forecast revisions of future stand-alone earnings are significantly greater for targets with low Tobin's q-ratios relative to targets with high q-ratios, lending further support to the information hypothesis. Finally, we provide evidence that managerial resistance to the takeover does not destroy value. Our results are in direct contrast to Pound (1988).","['Peter A.

This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that informed trades are concentrated in the medium-size category, and that price movements are due mainly to informed traders' private information.","['Michael J.

Restructuring through spinoffs,"We investigate the value created through spinoffs over the 1965–1988 period by measuring the stock returns of spinoffs, their parent firms, and parent-spinoff combinations for periods of up to three years following the spinoffs. We find significantly positive abnormal returns for spinoffs, their parents, and the spinoff-parent combinations. Both the spinoffs and parents experience an unusually high incidence of takeovers and the abnormal performance is limited to firms involved in takeover activity. These findings suggest that spinoffs provide a low-cost method of transferring control of corporate assets to bidders who will create greater value.","['Patrick J. Cusatis', 'James A.
