The effect of capital structure on a firm's liquidation decision,"A firm's liquidation can impose costs on its customers, workers, and suppliers. An agency relationship between these individuals and the firm exists in that the liquidation decision controlled by the firm (as the agent) affects other individuals (the customers, workers, and suppliers as principals). The analysis in this paper suggests that capital structure can control the incentive/conflict problem of this relationship by serving as a pre-positioning or bonding mechanism. Appropriate selection of capital structure assures that incentives are aligned so that the firm implements the ex-ante value-maximizing liquidation policy.",['Sheridan Titman'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X84900357,Journal of Financial Economics,1984,13,1
Option arbitrage and strategy with large price changes,Arbitrage pricing theorems are derived for options on stocks with jumps as a well as local movements. The resulting valuation formulas depend on observable variables only. Closed-form valuation expressions are obtained in the case of large positive and negative jumps. These results translate into a simple algebra for characterizing the risk of arbitrage and investment portfolios. A continuous-time formulation of the infinite variance hypothesis leads to isomorphic pricing expressions.,['E.Philip Jones'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X84900333,Journal of Financial Economics,1984,13,1
The weekend effect on the distribution of stock prices,"Evidence of weekend effects on the distribution of security returns suggests that returns are generated by a process operating closer to trading time rather than calendar time. In contrast, accumulation of interest over the weekend follows a calendar-time process. Since both the variance of returns and the interest rate are important parameters of the Black-Scholes option pricing model, this paper suggests that the model be stated to account for this by utilizing a trading-time variance and a calendar-time interest rate. Empirical evidence indicates that this allows the model to better explain market option prices.",['Dan W.

On interpreting security returns during the ex-dividend period,"In this paper we examine the ex-dividend day returns of several taxable and non-taxable distributions. The ex-dividend day returns for the taxable common stocks are consistent with the hypothesis that dividends are taxed more heavily than capital gains. However, the ex-dividend day returns of preferred stocks suggest that preferred dividends are taxed at a lower rate than capital gains; non-taxable stock dividends and splits are priced on ex-dividend days as if they are fully taxable; and non-taxable cash distributions are priced as if investors receive a tax rebate with them. We also find that each of these distributions exhibits abnormal return behavior for several days surrounding the ex-dividend day. We investigate several possible explanations for this anomaly, but none is capable of explaining the phenomenon.","['Kenneth M. Eades', 'Patrick J.

Call options and the risk of underlying securities,"Merton (1973) in his seminal article ‘Theory of Rational Option Pricing’ showed that the rationally determined price of a call option is a non-decreasing function of the ‘riskness’ of its associated common stock. In deriving his results, Merton made restrictive assumptions about the way the market prices payoff distributions, and used the Rothschild-Stiglitz (1970) measure to compare the riskiness of securities. I show by means of an example that the Merton result will not in general be true. I then derive a sufficient condition for the option on one stock to have higher market value than the option on another stock, when both the stocks have the same price, and explain why the Merton result is valid in the Black-Scholes environment.",['Ravi Jagannathan'],[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X84900072,Journal of Financial Economics,1984,13,3
‘Open-ending’ closed-end funds,"Open-ending a closed-end fund forces the price of the fund's shares to their net asset value. Open-ending behavior is shown to correspond in predictable ways to the incentive to open-end and to potential resistance to open-ending. Moreover, closed-end fund share prices begin to generate statistically significant positive abnormal returns well in advance of the formal announcement of the open-ending. Although a small part of the total abnormal return is not entirely exhausted until after the announcement, such market price performance is broadly consistent with a semi-strong form efficient market.",['Greggory A.

Wealth redistributions or changes in firm value,"Past studies indicate that stock prices are affected by announcements of unexpected dividend changes, i.e., unexpectedly large dividends are associated with positive stock price response. Two explanations of this empirical regularity, ‘the information content hypothesis’ and the ‘wealth redistribution hypothesis’, imply different bond price behavior around dividend announcements. The information content hypothesis predicts a positive bond price response to unexpectedly large dividends, while the wealth redistribution hypothesis predicts the opposite. This paper distinguishes between the relative importance of the two hypotheses by empirically investigating bond price behavior around dividend announcements. The evidence presented is consistent with the information content hypothesis. However, the gains associated with positive information are captured by the stockholders, while the losses are shared with the bondholders.","['George Handjinicolaou', 'Avner Kalay']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8490031X,Journal of Financial Economics,1984,13,1
Optimal bond trading with personal taxes,"Tax considerations governing bondholders' optimal trading include: capital loss realization; capital gain deferment; change of the long-term holding period status to short-term by sale of the bond and repurchase, to realize future losses short-term; raising the basis above par by sale of the bond and repurchase, to deduct the amortized premium from ordinary income. The optimal policy which incorporates transactions costs and conforms to the IRS code substantially differs from the buy-and-hold and continuous-realization policies. Failure to account for optimal trading may seriously bias econometric estimation of the yield curve and the tax bracket of the marginal bondholders.","['George M. Constantinides', 'Jonathan E.

The quality option implicit in futures contracts,"The quality option implicit in futures contracts allows the short position to satisfy the contract by delivering one of a variety of specified assets. If, at the time the contract is purchased, knowledge of which of the allowed assets will be cheapest at maturity is uncertain, then the quality option will have value. The greater the value of this option, the lower will be the futures price. This paper presents, and tests, a futures pricing model that incorporates the quality option aspect of commodity futures contracts. Our research shows that the quality option has a significant impact on futures prices.","['Gerald D.

The likelihood ratio test statistic of mean-variance efficiency without a riskless asset,"The question whether a given porfolio is mean-variance efficient is a basic problem of investment analysis. Mean-variance efficiency is also the basis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. This paper presents the explicit form of the likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that a given portfolio, or a particular market index, is ex-ante mean-variance efficient in the case where there is no riskless asset. Geometric relations are illustrated to provide intuition about the constrained maximum likelihood estimators and the test statistic, and two simple economic interpretations of the test are given.",['Shmuel Kandel'],[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X84900175,Journal of Financial Economics,1984,13,4
Optimal stock trading with personal taxes,"The tax law confers upon the investor a timing option - to realize capital losses and defer capital gains. With the tax rate on long term gains and losses being about half the short term rate, the law provides a second timing option - to realize losses short term and gains long term, if at all. Our theory and simulation over the 1962–1977 period establish that taxable investors should realize long term gains in high variance stocks and repurchase stock in order to realize potential future losses short term. Tax trading does not explain the small-firm anomaly but predicts a seasonal pattern in trading volume which maps into a seasonal pattern in stock prices, the January anomaly, only if investors are irrational or ignorant of the price seasonality.",['George M.

Explaining investor preference for cash dividends,"The well-known tendency of investors to favor cash dividends emerges quite naturally in two new theories of choice behavior [the theory of self-control due to Thaler and Shefrin (1981), and the version of prospect theory set out by Kahneman and Tversky (1979)]. Although our treatment is novel when viewed from the perspective of standard financial theory, it provides explanations for a phenomenon that has long been described as perplexing.","['Hersh M.

Corporate financing and investment decisions when firms have information that investors do not have,"This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity. Management is assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally. An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed.","['Stewart C. Myers', 'Nicholas S.

Term premiums in bond returns,This paper examines expected returns on U.S. Treasury bills and on U.S. Government bond portfolios. Expected bill returns are estimated from forward rates and from sample average returns. Both estimation methods indicate that expected returns on bills tend to peak at eight or nine months and never increase monotonically out to twelve months. Reliable inferences are limited to Treasury bills and thus to maturities up to a year. The variability of longer-term bond returns preempts precise conclusions about their expected returns.,['Eugene F Fama'],[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8490014X,Journal of Financial Economics,1984,13,4
"Arbitrage pricing, transaction costs and taxation of capital gains","This paper examines one of the few cases of seemingly redundant securities: sets of three government bonds with the same maturity date. Within the bounds on relative bond prices established by tax-exempt investors in a market with proportional transaction costs, the taxation of capital gains on the basis of realization has a significant impact on relative prices. The empirical evidence supports the tax option effect discussed by Constantinides and Ingersoll, but does not generally support the segmented tax-clientele equilibrium discussed by Schaefer.","['Robert H.

The intraday speed of adjustment of stock prices to earnings and dividend announcements,"This paper examines the effects of Broad Tape news releases of earnings and dividend announcements on three aspects of intraday stock price behavior: mean returns, return variance, and serial correlation in consecutive price changes. The initial price reaction is evident in the first pair of price changes following the release (i.e., within a few minutes, at most). The returns earned by simple trading rules dissipate within five to ten minutes, although significant returns are detected in the overnight period and at the opening of trading on the next day. Disturbances in the variance and serial correlation persist for several hours and extend into the following trading day. As a class, dividend announcements induce much less activity than do earnings, although the response to dividend changes is comparable to the earnings announcement effect.","['James M.

"Investment incentives, debt, and warrants","This paper models and characterizes investment incentive problems associated with debt financing. The decision problem of residual claimants is explicity formulated and their investment policies are characterized. The paper also analyzes the use of conversion features and warrants to control distortionary incentives. These claims reverse the convex shape of levered equity over the upper range of the firm's earnings, and this mitigates the incentive to take risk. It is shown that, under certain conditions, such claims can be constructed to restore net present value maximizing incentives and simultaneously meet the financing requirements of the firm.",['Richard C.

The information in the term structure,"This paper presents a regression approach to measuring the information in forward interest rates about time varying premiums and future spot interest rates. Like earlier work, the regressions identify variation in the expected premiums on longer-maturity Treasury bills. The more novel evidence concerns the forecasts of future spot rates in forward rates. The regressions provide evidence that the one-month forward rate has power to predict the spot rate one month ahead. During periods preceding 1974, forward rates have reliable forecast power for one-month spot rates up to five months in the future.",['Eugene F.

"Convertible debt issuance, capital structure change and financing-related information","This paper provides evidence on the valuation effects of convertible debt issuance. Common stockholders earn significant negative abnormal returns at the initial announcement of a convertible debt offering, and also at the issuance date. In contrast, the average valuation effect on common stock at the announcement of non-convertible debt offerings is only marginally negative, and is zero at issuance. The significant negative average effect on common stock value appears not to be systematically related to either the degree of leverage change induced by the convertible debt issuance or the extent to which the proceeds from issuance are used for new investment or to refinance existing debt. If, as appears likely, the issuance of convertible debt on average increases financial leverage, these results are inconsistent with evidence from other recent studies documenting common stock price effects of the same sign as the change in leverage. The evidence suggests that convertible debt offerings convey unfavorable information about the issuing firms, but the specific nature of such information remains unidentified.","['Larry Y.

Volume and turn-of-the-year behavior,"This paper studies the trading characteristics of listed companies by size, and year-end behavior. There were no transactions on nearly 25% of the days for the smallest decile even at the turn of year which is an active trading period for small companies. As a result of low levels of trading and the regulations governing exchange specialists, transaction prices and quotations of small listed companies may require several days to fully reflect equilibrium price changes. The data confirm the existence of a year-end seasonal pattern in rates of return for small companies and suggest that there may be a seasonal pattern for large companies as well.","['Josef Lakonishok', 'Seymour Smidt']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X84900084,Journal of Financial Economics,1984,13,3
The valuation effects of stock splits and stock dividends,"This study presents evidence which indicates that stock prices, on average, react positively to stock dividend and stock split announcements that are uncontaminated by other contemporaneous firm-specific announcements. In addition, it documents significantly positive excess returns on and around the ex-dates of stock dividends and splits. Both announcement and ex-date returns were found to be larger for stock dividends than for stock splits. While the announcement returns cannot be explained by forecasts of imminent increases in cash dividends, the paper offers several signalling based explanations for them. These are consistent with a cross-sectional analysis of the announcement period returns.","['Mark S. Grinblatt', 'Ronald W.

A strategic analysis of sinking fund bonds,"Unlike most securities, the pricing of sinking fund bonds is influenced by the distribution of ownership, which summarizes the extent to which the market is cornered. The effect of the distribution of ownership on the pricing of sinking fund bonds is examined by an explicit game in which the price obtained for bonds sold can depend upon the size of the investor's position. This framework is used to contrast the valuation of sinking fund bonds with the valuation of amortizing bonds and straight debt. We show that it is generally incorrect to view sinking fund bonds as being equivalent to serial bonds.","['Kenneth B. Dunn', 'Chester S.

Warrant exercise and bond conversion in competitive markets,We develop a theory of warrants held by competitive warrantholders not constrained to exercise their warrants as one block; the theory also applies to convertible bonds held by competitive bondholders not constrained to convert their bonds as one block. We prove that the warrant (bond) price in each of the competitive equilibria is less than or equal to the price in an economy with the block constraint; and for at least one competitive equilibrium the warrant (bond) price equals the warrant (bond) price in the block-constrained economy. We illustrate the paths of competitive warrant exercise and bond conversion and conclude that under realistic assumptions they can be long.,['George M.

Differential information and the small firm effect,"We examine a model of market equilibrium in which there is less information available about some of the securities in the market than about others. We consider the model as a potential explanation of the well-known small firm anomaly. Using period of listing as a proxy for quantity of information, we find an association between period of listing and security returns that cannot be accounted for by firm size and which is not diminished by an elimination of January returns data from our sample. Thus, we observe a new empirical regularity in the data and refer to the regularity as the ‘period of listing’ effect.","['Christopher B. Barry', 'Stephen J.
