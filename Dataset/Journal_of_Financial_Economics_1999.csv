Understanding the determinants of managerial ownership and the link between ownership and performance,"Both managerial ownership and performance are endogenously determined by exogenous (and only partly observed) changes in the firm's contracting environment. We extend the cross-sectional results of Demsetz and Lehn (1985), (Journal of Political Economy, 93, 1155–1177) and use panel data to show that managerial ownership is explained by key variables in the contracting environment in ways consistent with the predictions of principal-agent models. A large fraction of the cross-sectional variation in managerial ownership is explained by unobserved firm heterogeneity. Moreover, after controlling both for observed firm characteristics and firm fixed effects, we cannot conclude (econometrically) that changes in managerial ownership affect firm performance.","['Charles P.

The initiation and withdrawal of odd-eighth quotes among Nasdaq stocks: an empirical analysis,"Christie and Schultz (1994), (Journal of Finance, 49, 1813–1840) find that market makers in many active Nasdaq stocks avoid odd-eighth quotes. This paper studies 67 (58) Nasdaq stocks whose market makers initiate (withdraw) odd-eighth quotes. These regime shifts are often completed within the span of a day, and coincide with dramatic changes in dollar, percentage and effective spreads. In most cases, we are unable to identify comparable changes in the costs of making markets. We do identify long-run changes in average prices that may provide a partial explanation. However, we also find that these patterns are not shared by stocks traded in auction markets.","['William G. Christie', 'Paul H.

Commercial banks as underwriters: implications for the going public process,"Commercial bank entry into securities underwriting can affect underwriter behavior because, unlike investment houses, banks also lend to firms. This raises several issues. Are banks better certifiers of firms’ securities than investment houses? If banks hold equity in firms rather than debt, does this make certification more credible? Would one type of underwriter drive out the other? This paper provides a model for analyzing such issues, and derives several interesting results. First, banks, as lenders to firms, can actually be better certifiers than investment houses. Second, equity holding can hinder banks’ certification ability. Finally, banks and investment houses can co-exist.",['Manju Puri'],"['Commercial banks', 'Underwriters', 'Certification', 'Security pricing', 'Glass–Steagall']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000343,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,54,2
Deregulation and the adaptation of governance structure: the case of the U.S. airline industry,"Deregulation provides a natural experiment for examining how governance adapts to structural changes in the business environment. We investigate the evolution of governance structure, characterized by ownership concentration, compensation policy, and board composition, in the U.S. airline industry during a 22-year period surrounding the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Consistent with theory, we find that after deregulation (i) equity ownership is more concentrated, (ii) CEO pay increases, (iii) stock option grants to CEOs increase, and (iv) board size decreases. Airlines’ governance structures gravitate toward the system of governance mechanisms used by unregulated firms. The adaptation process is gradual, however, suggesting that it is costly to alter organizational capital. We also present evidence on the relation between governance structure and firm survival.","['Stacey R. Kole', 'Kenneth M.

Financial contracting under extreme uncertainty:,"Economic volatility, high transaction costs, and fragile institutions hinder financial contracting in emerging markets. These conditions characterize the economy of Brazil, yet a nascent corporate bond market thrives. I analyze 50 Brazilian indenture agreements and find that sample debentures are characterized by (i) features that mitigate inflation risk for investors, (ii) contingent-maturity mechanisms that provide periodic opportunities for exit or renegotiation, (iii) a paucity of covenants that restrict the debtor's investment, financing, and dividend decisions, and (iv) self-enforcement mechanisms that avoid reliance on inefficient institutions. Analysis of these features enhances our understanding of contracting in emerging economies.",['Christopher W Anderson'],"['Contracting', 'Debt structure', 'Covenants', 'Institutions', 'Emerging markets', 'Brazil']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000439,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,51,1
Board meeting frequency and firm performance,"For 307 firms over the 1990–1994 period, I find that board meeting frequency is related to corporate governance and ownership characteristics in a manner that is consistent with contracting and agency theory. The annual number of board meetings is inversely related to firm value. This result is driven by increases in board activity following share price declines. I further find that operating performance improves following years of abnormal board activity. These improvements are most pronounced for firms with poor prior performance and firms not engaged in corporate control transactions. Overall, my results suggest that board activity, measured by board meeting frequency, is an important dimension of board operations.",['Nikos Vafeas'],"['Corporate governance', 'Board of directors', 'Board meeting frequency']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000185,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,53,1
An analysis of mutual fund design: the case of investing in small-cap stocks1,"In 1982, Dimensional Fund Advisors launched a mutual fund intended to capture the returns of small-cap stocks. The ‘9–10 Fund’ is based on the CRSP 9–10 Index, an index of small-cap stocks constituting the ninth and tenth deciles of NYSE market capitalization, although the 9–10 Fund incorporates investment rules and a trading strategy that are aimed at minimizing the potentially excessive trade costs associated with such illiquid stocks. As a result, the 9–10 Fund provided a 2.2% annual premium over the 9–10 Index for the 1982–1995 period. We show that both the investment rules and the trade strategy components of the Fund’s design contribute significantly to this return difference.",['Donald B.

The rise and fall of the Amex Emerging Company Marketplace,"In 1992, the Amex launched the Emerging Company Marketplace (ECM) to trade the stocks of small but growing companies. Bid–ask spreads decreased dramatically for listing firms, and news coverage increased. Executives of listing firms were quite satisfied. Yet few firms chose to list on the ECM, and it closed in 1995. What went wrong? Most Amex stakeholders had little to gain from the success of the ECM, and a series of scandals damaged the reputation of the exchange. Similar small-firm markets have also failed, largely because successful firms quickly depart for traditional markets, leaving only unsuccessful firms behind.","['Reena Aggarwal', 'James J.

The resolution of bankruptcy by auction: allocating the residual right of design,"In this paper, we examine the value of the right to choose the method of sale of corporate assets. We show that this right is valuable, and that its value comes from recognizing conflicting incentives of claimants at the time of sale. As with risky projects, senior and junior claimants are shown to have distinct preferences on a set of common auction procedures. They also differ on the issue of allocation of resources towards attracting bidders for the auction. As a consequence, the optimal allocation of the design right must depend on circumstances prevailing at the time of the sale. While, in general, selling the firm by auction does not guarantee the use of optimal selling arrangements, a suitable allocation of design rights may help mitigate inefficiency problems significantly.","['Sugato Bhattacharyya', 'Rajdeep Singh']","['Bankruptcy', 'Auctions', 'Residual rights']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000380,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,54,3
"Deregulation, disintermediation, and agency costs of debt: evidence from Japan1","Many Japanese firms reduced dependence on banks following financial deregulation in the 1980s. The financial architecture of Japanese firms after liberalization provides an opportunity to investigate the choice of financing with public bonds versus monitored bank loans. Examination of accounting and stock price data for a sample of Japanese firms in the late 1980s suggests that debt structure is related to variables that serve as proxies for agency costs of debt. In particular, we find that the proportion of bond debt is inversely related to growth opportunities, while the proportion of bank debt is positively related to growth opportunities.","['Christopher W.

The adaptive mesh model: a new approach to efficient option pricing,"Most derivative securities must be priced by numerical techniques. These models contain “distribution error” and “nonlinearity error”. The Adaptive Mesh Model (AMM) sharply reduces nonlinearity error by grafting one or more small sections of fine high-resolution lattice onto a tree with coarser time and price steps. Three different AMM structures are presented, one for pricing ordinary options, one for barrier options, and one for computing delta and gamma efficiently. The AMM approach can be adapted to a wide variety of contingent claims. For some common problems, accuracy increases by several orders of magnitude with no increase in execution time.","['Stephen Figlewski', 'Bin Gao']","['Adaptive Mesh', 'Option valuation', 'Lattice models', 'Barrier options', 'Numerical valuation techniques']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000240,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,53,3
Investor flows and the assessed performance of open-end mutual funds,"Open-end equity funds provide a diversified equity positions with little direct cost to investors for liquidity. This study documents a statistically significant indirect cost in the form of a negative relation between a fund's abnormal return and investor flows. Controlling for this indirect cost of liquidity changes the average fund's abnormal return (net of expenses) from a statistically significant −1.6% per year to a statistically insignificant −0.2% and also fully explains the negative market-timing performance found in this and other studies of mutual fund returns. Thus, the common finding of negative return performance at open-end mutual funds is attributable to the costs of liquidity-motivated trading.",['Roger M.

The motivation and impact of pension fund activism,"Pension funds have pursued an active role in corporate governance, although some question their effectiveness and motivations. We examine the impact and motivation of pension fund activism by studying the shareholder proposals of the largest, most active funds from 1987 through 1993. We find significant heterogeneity across funds in activism objectives, tactics, and impact on target firms, consistent with differing investment strategies. We find the funds are more successful at monitoring and promoting change in target firms than previously recognized. We also find no evidence to support motivations other than fund value maximization.","['Diane Del Guercio', 'Jennifer Hawkins']","['Shareholder activism', 'Pension funds', 'Corporate governance', 'Proxy contest', 'Control activity']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000112,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,52,3
Ex-day behavior with dividend preference and limitations to short-term arbitrage: the case of Swedish lottery bonds,"Swedish lottery bonds offer a unique opportunity to study ex-day effects in an environment where cash distributions are tax-advantaged relative to capital gains. Thus, in the lottery bond market, we observe a reversal of the preference for capital gains that researchers have cited as an explanation for the ex-day behavior of U.S. equities. Further, in this market there are barriers to short-term arbitrage when prices do reflect the tax preferences of individual investors. We find the bonds are priced around the ex-day to reflect differential tax rates on income and capital gains consistent with the prevailing tax regimes. The bonds consistently experience negative returns over the coupon payment period, and in fact often sell at negative yields prior to the cash distribution, as one would expect given tax-motivated trading between high-tax investors, who buy prior to the distribution, and low-tax investors, who buy after the distribution.","['Richard C.

The stock pools and the Securities Exchange Act1,"The stated justification for the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) was to eliminate manipulation. The primary evidence of manipulation was the existence of `stock pools,' through which groups of traders jointly traded in a particular stock. The conclusion of Congress that the pools were manipulative is inconsistent with the evidence produced by the Senate's own investigation. The returns on a sample of pool stocks are also inconsistent with manipulation. These findings suggest that congressional and presidential desires to increase political control over the New York Stock Exchange was a more important motivation for the Exchange Act.",['Paul G.

Valuing IPOs,"The use of accounting information in conjunction with comparable firm multiples is widely recommended for valuing initial public offerings (IPOs). We find that the price–earnings (P/E), market-to-book, and price-to-sales multiples of comparable firms have only modest predictive ability without further adjustments. This is largely due to the wide variation of these ratios for young firms within an industry. P/E multiples using forecasted earnings result in much more accurate valuations than multiples using trailing earnings.","['Moonchul Kim', 'Jay R.

The performance of investment newsletters,"This paper analyzes the recommendations of common stocks made by the investment newsletters followed by the Hulbert Financial Digest. We conclude that, taken as a whole, the securities that newsletters recommend do not outperform appropriate benchmarks. Our data provide modest evidence that the future performance of a newsletter is related to its past performance, when performance is measure by raw returns. Evidence of persistence vanishes, however, when performance is measured by abnormal returns. We find little, if any, evidence of herding, i.e., cross-sectional dependence of recommendations, across newsletters. Newsletters tend to recommend securities that have performed well in the recent past. Finally, newsletters with poor past performance are more likely to go out of business.","['Jeffrey F.

Does stock price elasticity affect corporate financial decisions?,"This paper considers whether stock price elasticity affects corporate financial decisions. Basic economic principles and the existing theoretical literature predict that firms choosing the Dutch auction instead of the fixed price tender offer should be those firms expecting to face greater stock price elasticity. Econometric analysis suggests that firms choosing the Dutch auction instead of the fixed price tender offer between 1984 and 1989 are indeed those firms expecting to face greater stock elasticity, even though the average realized elasticities of the firms conducting the various tender offers fail to be significantly different. The expected elasticity remains an important determinant of the tender offer choice even when allowing for firm characteristics associated with the choice of repurchase method. Firms facing greater elasticity are also characterized. The findings suggest that expected stock price elasticity may be an important determinant of corporate financial decisions that affect the supply of, or demand for, stock.",['Laurie Simon Hodrick'],"['Repurchases', 'Dutch auctions', 'Fixed price tender offers', 'Elasticity', 'Quasi-maximum likelihood estimation']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000094,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,52,2
"Bank entry, competition, and the market for corporate securities underwriting","This paper examines the competitive effects of commercial bank entry into the corporate debt underwriting market, particularly with respect to underwriter spreads, ex-ante yields, and market concentration. We find that underwriter spreads and ex-ante yields have declined significantly with bank entry, consistent with the market becoming more competitive. This effect is strongest among the lower-rated and smaller debt issues of which banks have underwritten a relatively greater share. The early evidence also indicates that bank entry has tended to decrease market concentration. Overall, our results suggest that bank entry has had a pro-competitive effect.","['Amar Gande', 'Manju Puri', 'Anthony Saunders']","['Commercial banks', 'Underwriters', 'Certification', 'Spreads', 'Yields', 'Glass–Steagall']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000355,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,54,2
Do foreign investors destabilize stock markets? The Korean experience in 1997,"This paper examines the impact of foreign investors on stock returns in Korea from November 30, 1996 to the end of 1997 using order and trade data. We find strong evidence of positive feedback trading and herding by foreign investors before the period of Korea's economic crisis. During the crisis period, herding falls, and positive feedback trading by foreign investors mostly disappears. We find no evidence that trades by foreign investors had a destabilizing effect on Korea's stock market over our sample period. In particular, the market adjusted quickly and efficiently to large sales by foreign investors, and these sales were not followed by negative abnormal returns.","['Hyuk Choe', 'Bong-Chan Kho', 'René M Stulz']","['Foreign investors', 'Positive feedback trading', 'Herding', 'East Asian crisis']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000379,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,54,2

"The time-series relations among expected return, risk, and book-to-market","This paper examines the time-series relations among expected return, risk, and book-to-market (B/M) at the portfolio level. I find that B/M predicts economically and statistically significant time-variation in expected stock returns. Further, B/M is strongly associated with changes in risk, as measured by the Fama and French (1993) (Journal of Financial Economics, 33, 3–56) three-factor model. After controlling for risk, B/M provides no incremental information about expected returns.

Managerial performance and the cross-sectional pricing of closed-end funds,"This paper finds that discounts and premiums of closed-end funds reflect the market's assessment of anticipated managerial performance. Using single and multiple benchmarks, we present evidence that there is a significant and positive relation between stock fund premiums and future net asset value performance over the following year. The relation is not caused by the anticipation of future expenses. We also find that bond closed-end funds show no such relation between premium and asset value performance.","['J.B.

Both the likelihood that a retired CEO serves on his own board two years after departure, as well as the likelihood of serving as an outside director on other boards, are positively and strongly related to his performance while CEO. Retention on the CEO's own board depends primarily on stock returns, while service on outside boards is better explained by accounting returns. The evidence also suggests that firms consider ability in choosing board members.","['James A. Brickley', 'James S. Linck', 'Jeffrey L.

GMM tests of stochastic discount factor models with useless factors,"This paper studies generalized method of moments tests for the stochastic discount factor representation of asset pricing models when one of the proposed factors is in fact useless, defined as being independent of the asset returns. Analytic results on asymptotic distributions and simulation results on finite sample distributions both show that (i) the Wald test tends to overreject the hypothesis of a zero factor premium for a useless factor when the model is misspecified, (ii) with the presence of a useless factor, the power of the over-identifying restriction test in rejecting misspecified models is reduced, and in some cases a misspecified model with a useless factor is more likely to be accepted than the true model.","['Raymond Kan', 'Chu Zhang']","['Stochastic discount factor models', 'Generalized method of moments', 'Nonidentifiability', 'Useless factors', 'Misspecification']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000331,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,54,1
Conditional market timing with benchmark investors,"This paper tests models of mutual fund market timing that allow the manager's payoff function to depend on returns in excess of a benchmark, and distinguish timing based on publicly available information from timing based on finer information. We simultaneously estimate parameters which describe the public information environment, the manager's risk aversion, and the precision of the fund's market-timing signal. Using a sample of more than 400 U.S. mutual funds for 1976–94, our findings suggest that mutual funds behave as highly risk averse, benchmark investors. Conditioning on public information improves the model specification. After controlling for the public information, we find no evidence that funds have significant market-timing ability.","['Connie Becker', 'Wayne Ferson', 'David H. Myers', 'Michael J.

Testing static tradeoff against pecking order models of capital structure1,"This paper tests traditional capital structure models against the alternative of a pecking order model of corporate financing. The basic pecking order model, which predicts external debt financing driven by the internal financial deficit, has much greater time-series explanatory power than a static tradeoff model, which predicts that each firm adjusts gradually toward an optimal debt ratio. We show that our tests have the power to reject the pecking order against alternative tradeoff hypotheses. The statistical power of some usual tests of the tradeoff model is virtually nil.","['Lakshmi Shyam-Sunder', 'Stewart C.

The sensitivity of CEO wealth to equity risk: an analysis of the magnitude and determinants,"To control risk-related incentive problems, equity holders are expected to manage both the convexity and slope of the relation between firm performance and managers’ wealth. I find stock options, but not common stockholdings, significantly increase the sensitivity of CEOs’ wealth to equity risk. Cross-sectionally, this sensitivity is positively related to firms’ investment opportunities. This result is consistent with managers receiving incentives to invest in risky projects when the potential loss from underinvestment in valuable risk-increasing projects is greatest. Firms’ stock-return volatility is positively related to the convexity provided to managers, suggesting convex incentive schemes influence investing and financing decisions.",['Wayne R.

Stock-based incentive contracts and managerial performance: the case of Ralston Purina Company1,"Under Ralston Purina Company's 1986 incentive contract 14 managers would receive $49.1 million in stock if within ten years the stock price closed above $100 for ten consecutive days. While the contract required a 57.8% increase in stock price, it did not motivate managers to create value because the rate of return required to reach $100 in ten years was substantially less than Ralston's cost of equity capital at the time of the contract's adoption. Barring any action by managers that would substantially change the market's expectations about the firm, reaching the $100 hurdle price would be easy. In fact, managers collected the contract's payoffs within five years despite an industry-adjusted loss of $2.1 billion in shareholder value.","['Cynthia J Campbell', 'Charles E Wasley']","['Incentives', 'Executive compensation', 'Share repurchases', 'Cost of equity capital', 'Relative performance evaluation']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000506,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,51,2
Long-term returns from equity carveouts1,"Using a sample of 628 carveouts during 1981–1995, this paper finds that the newly issued subsidiary stocks do not underperform appropriate benchmarks over a three-year period following the carveout. This result is in striking contrast with the documented poor performance of initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings. I conjecture that the superior performance of subsidiary stocks arises because the subsidiary and parent firms can focus on fewer business segments after carveout, and because the parent firms continue to own a monitoring position in the subsidiary firms. I test whether the subsidiary stock performance is related to the number of business segments the parent firm has before carveout. The relationship is not always significant, which suggests another possible explanation, that the market may react efficiently to the likely future performance of carveouts.",['Anand M Vijh'],"['Carveouts', 'Divestitures', 'Initial public offerings', 'Long-term returns', 'Seasoned equity offerings']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000531,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,51,2
An analysis of compensation in the U.S. venture capital partnership1,"Venture capital limited partnerships are an attractive arena to study cross-sectional and time-series variations in compensation schemes. We empirically examine 419 partnerships. The compensation of new and smaller funds displays considerably less sensitivity to performance and less variation than that of other funds. The fixed base component of compensation is higher for younger and smaller firms. We observe no relation between incentive compensation and performance. Our evidence is consistent with a learning model, in which the pay of new venture capitalists is less sensitive to performance because reputational concerns induce them to work hard.","['Paul Gompers', 'Josh Lerner']","['Venture capital', 'Private equity', 'Contract', 'Limited partnership']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000427,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,51,1
An analysis of value destruction and recovery in the alliance and proposed merger of Volvo and Renault1,"Volvo's attempt to merge with Renault in 1993 temporarily destroyed SEK 8.6 billion (US$ 1.1 billion) in Volvo shareholder wealth. This study traces the destruction to hubris, managerialism, and the escalation of commitment – elements suggested in previous research. In addition, the case suggests path dependence as a source of wealth destruction in mergers. An elaborate structure of cross-shareholdings, joint committees, and a poison pill made it difficult for the strategic allies (Volvo and Renault) to follow any strategic path other than merger if they wanted to exploit economies more fully. Activism by institutional investors was instrumental in halting the destruction of shareholder wealth and redirecting the firm. This study reveals significant positive abnormal returns associated with the institutional activism. Consistent with Shleifer and Vishny (1986), institutional `jawboning' is valuable. An analysis of the voting premium between Volvo's `A' and `B' shares suggests that the value created by institutional voice derived from the strategic change in the firm's direction rather than the power of the coalition of institutional investors to expropriate wealth.",['Robert F Bruner'],"['Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'Alliances', 'Institutional investors', 'Privatization']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000464,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,51,1
The long-run performance of stock returns following debt offerings,"We document substantial long-run post-issue underperformance by firms making straight and convertible debt offerings from 1975 to 1989. This long-run underperformance is more severe for smaller, younger, and NASDAQ-listed firms, and for firms issuing speculative grade debt. We also find strong evidence that the underperformance of issuers of both straight and convertible debt is limited to those issues that occur in periods with a high volume of issues. In contrast to earlier event studies that found insignificantly negative abnormal returns at the time of debt issue announcements and concluded that debt offerings had no impact on shareholder wealth, our results suggest that debt offerings, like equity offerings, are signals that the firm is overvalued. As with equity offerings and repurchases, the market appears to underreact at the time of the debt offering announcement so that the full impact of the offering is only realized over a longer time horizon.","['D.Katherine Spiess', 'John Affleck-Graves']","['Debt offerings', 'Underperformance']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000318,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,54,1
"Information asymmetry, valuation, and the corporate spin-off decision","We empirically analyze the information hypothesis that the separation of a firm's divisions into independently traded units through a spin-off enhances value because it mitigates information asymmetry about the firm. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that firms that engage in spin-offs have higher levels of information asymmetry compared to their industry and size matched counterparts and the information problems decrease significantly after the spin-off. The gains around spin-offs are positively related to the degree of information asymmetry, and this relation is more pronounced for firms with fewer negative synergies between divisions. Finally, firms with higher growth opportunities and firms in need of external capital show a higher propensity to engage in spin-offs. They also raise more capital following a spin-off, which is consistent with the view that these firms mitigate information asymmetry before approaching the capital market for funds.","['Sudha Krishnaswami', 'Venkat Subramaniam']","['Spin-offs', 'Divestitures', 'Information asymmetry']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000173,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,53,1
"Information asymmetry, monitoring, and the placement structure of corporate debt1","We empirically examine the impact of flotation costs, agency conflicts, regulation, and information asymmetries on a firm's mix between public and private debt. Results indicate that firms with larger issue sizes exploit the scale economies in flotation costs of public debt. Firms with higher contracting costs due to moral hazard have higher proportions of private debt. There is only limited support for the adverse selection hypothesis. We find little evidence that firms with favorable private information about future profitability choose more private debt. However, those firms with favorable information about future profitability that also operate under greater information asymmetry rely more on private debt.","['Sudha Krishnaswami', 'Paul A Spindt', 'Venkat Subramaniam']","['Debt financing', 'Monitoring', 'Moral hazard', 'Adverse selection', 'Capital structure']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000592,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,51,3
"Institutions, financial markets, and firm debt maturity","We examine firm debt maturity in 30 countries during the period 1980–1991. In countries with active stock markets, large firms have more long-term debt. Stock market activity is not correlated with debt levels of small firms. By contrast, in countries with a large banking sector, small firms have less short-term debt and their debt is of longer maturity. Variation in the size of the banking sector is uncorrelated with the capital structures of large firms. Government subsidies to industry are positively related and inflation is negatively related to the use of long-term debt. We also find evidence of maturity matching.","['Asli Demirgüç-Kunt', 'Vojislav Maksimovic']","['Capital structure', 'Debt maturity', 'Financial institutions', 'Legal system']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000392,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,54,3
How are stock prices affected by the location of trade?,"We examine pairs of large, `Siamese twin’ companies whose stocks are traded around the world but have different trading and ownership habitats. Twins pool their cash flows, so, with integrated markets, twin stocks should move together. However, the difference between the prices of twin stocks appears to be correlated with the markets on which they are traded most, i.e., a twin's relative price rises when the market on which it is traded relatively intensively rises. We examine several explanations of this phenomenon including: the discretionary use of dividend income by parent companies: differences in parent expenditures; voting rights; currency fluctuations; ex-dividend date timing issues; and tax-induced investor heterogeneity. Only the last hypothesis can explain some, but not all, of the empirical facts. We conjecture that: (a) country-specific sentiment shocks might affect share intensity, (b) investors are rational, but markets are segmented by frictions other than international transactions costs, such as agency problems.","['Kenneth A.

The determinants and implications of corporate cash holdings,"We examine the determinants and implications of holdings of cash and marketable securities by publicly traded U.S. firms in the 1971–1994 period. In time-series and cross-section tests, we find evidence supportive of a static tradeoff model of cash holdings. In particular, firms with strong growth opportunities and riskier cash flows hold relatively high ratios of cash to total non-cash assets. Firms that have the greatest access to the capital markets, such as large firms and those with high credit ratings, tend to hold lower ratios of cash to total non-cash assets. At the same time, however, we find evidence that firms that do well tend to accumulate more cash than predicted by the static tradeoff model where managers maximize shareholder wealth. There is little evidence that excess cash has a large short-run impact on capital expenditures, acquisition spending, and payouts to shareholders. The main reason that firms experience large changes in excess cash is the occurrence of operating losses.","['Tim Opler', 'Lee Pinkowitz', 'René Stulz', 'Rohan Williamson']",[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000033,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,52,1
Ownership and board structures in publicly traded corporations,"We examine the equity ownership structure and board composition of a sample of 583 firms over the ten-year period 1983–1992. Our evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of firms exhibit large changes in ownership and board structure in any given year. These changes are correlated with one another and are not reversed in subsequent years. Ownership and board changes are strongly related to top executive turnover, prior stock price performance, and corporate control threats, but only weakly related to changes in firm-specific determinants of ownership and board structure. Furthermore, large ownership changes are typically preceded by economic shocks and followed by asset restructurings.","['David J Denis', 'Atulya Sarin']","['Ownership structure', 'Board composition']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000082,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,52,2
Measuring investment distortions arising from stockholder–bondholder conflicts,We examine the importance of stockholder–bondholder conflicts in capital-structure choice. Numerical techniques are used to compute the expected wealth transfer between stockholders and bondholders when a firm adopts a new project. We characterize the set of positive NPV projects that stockholders prefer to ignore and the set of negative NPV projects that stockholders want to accept. The results illustrate how these distortions vary with firm and project characteristics. We also estimate the impact of stockholder–bondholder conflicts on investment decisions for 23 different firms and examine the extent to which stockholder-bondholder conflicts explain observed cross-sectional variation in capital structures.,"['Robert Parrino', 'Michael S Weisbach']","['Capital structure', 'Stockholder–bondholder conflicts', 'Underinvestment', 'Asset substitution', 'Monte-Carlo simulations']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X9900015X,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,53,1
Capital gains tax rates and the cost of capital for small business: evidence from the IPO market,"We examine the issue prices of small initial public offerings around the 1993 tax law change that reduced the capital gains tax on qualified small business stock. We compare the actual issue price of new stock with a benchmark price that is not affected by the change in capital gains tax. We find that, after controlling for IPO underpricing, the issue prices of qualifying small business stock after the tax rate change are significantly higher than the issue prices before the change. A control sample of nonqualifying firms shows no significant difference in issue prices.","['David A.

Transaction costs and predictability: some utility cost calculations,"We examine the loss in utility for a consumer who ignores any or all of the following: (1) the multi-period nature of the consumer's portfolio-choice problem, (2) the empirically documented predictability of asset returns, or (3) transaction costs. Both the costs of behaving myopically and ignoring predictability can be substantial, although allowing for intermediate consumption reduces these costs. Ignoring realistic transaction costs (fixed and proportional) imposes significant utility costs that range from 0.8% up to 16.9% of wealth. For the scenarios that we consider, the presence of transaction costs always increases the utility cost of behaving myopically, but decreases the utility cost of ignoring predictability.","['Pierluigi Balduzzi', 'Anthony W Lynch']","['Portfolio choice', 'Transaction costs', 'Return predictability', 'Utility cost']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000045,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,52,1
Limit orders and the bid–ask spread,"We examine the role of limit-order traders and specialists in the market-making process. We find that a large portion of posted bid–ask quotes originates from the limit-order book without direct participation by specialists, and that competition between traders and specialists has a significant impact on the bid–ask spread. Specialists’ spreads are widest at the open, narrow until late morning, and then level off. The U-shaped intraday pattern of spreads largely reflects the intraday variation in spreads established by limit-order traders. Lastly, the intraday variation in limit-order spreads is significantly related to the intraday variation in limit-order placements and executions.","['Kee H Chung', 'Bonnie F Van Ness', 'Robert A Van Ness']","['Limit order', 'Bid–ask spread', 'Specialists']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000227,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,53,2
An analysis of contagion and competitive effects at commercial banks,"We examine whether an adverse event at one bank generates externalities for the banking industry, and assess whether the population of commercial banks is homogeneous. We find dividend reductions are negative events for both announcing money center and regional banks, but only reductions at money center banks have negative, contagion-type externalities. Dividend reductions at regional banks have positive competitive effects on geographic rivals. Regulatory enforcement actions induce negative valuation effects that are idiosyncratic to targeted banks, but actions against regional banks generate positive competitive effects on geographic rivals. Our evidence suggests that regional banking markets are not contestable.","['Myron B. Slovin', 'Marie E. Sushka', 'John A.

Firm performance and focus: long-run stock market performance following spinoffs,"We examine whether an increase in focus is an explanation for the stock market gains associated with spinoffs. For a sample of 155 spinoffs between the years 1975 and 1991, we find that the announcement period as well the long-run abnormal returns for the focus-increasing spinoffs are significantly larger than the corresponding abnormal returns for the non-focus-increasing spinoffs. The results for the change in operating performance are consistent with those for the stock market performance. Cross-sectionally, the stock market performance as well as the operating performance are positively associated with change in focus. An analysis of the non-focus-increasing spinoffs shows that the firms are likely to undertake these spinoffs to separate underperforming subsidiaries from the parents.","['Hemang Desai', 'Prem C.

Bank monitoring and the pricing of corporate public debt1,"We examine whether the existence of a bank/firm relationship lowers the cost of public debt financing. Using a sample of first public straight debt offers, we test the cross-monitoring effect of bank debt and Diamond's (1991, Journal of Political Economy, 99, 689–721) reputation-building argument. We find that the existence of bank debt lowers the at-issue yield spreads for first public straight bond offers by about 68 basis points, on average. Consistent with Diamond's reputation-building argument, we document that firm reputation is negatively related to the at-issue yield spread for initial public debt offers.","['Sudip Datta', 'Mai Iskandar-Datta', 'Ajay Patel']","['Bank cross-monitoring', 'Public debt pricing', 'Debt reputation', 'Yield spreads', 'Bond IPOs']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X98000609,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,51,3
"Corporate governance, chief executive officer compensation, and firm performance1","We find that measures of board and ownership structure explain a significant amount of cross-sectional variation in CEO compensation, after controlling for standard economic determinants of pay. Moreover, the signs of the coefficients on the board and ownership structure variables suggest that CEOs earn greater compensation when governance structures are less effective. We also find that the predicted component of compensation arising from these characteristics of board and ownership structure has a statistically significant negative relation with subsequent firm operating and stock return performance. Overall, our results suggest that firms with weaker governance structures have greater agency problems; that CEOs at firms with greater agency problems receive greater compensation; and that firms with greater agency problems perform worse.","['John E.

Odd-eighth avoidance as a defense against SOES bandits1,"We model the behavior of Nasdaq momentum traders, also known as SOES bandits. We show, all things being equal, that the profitability of SOES bandits decreases in the bid-ask spread, but increases in the effective tick size. The patterns we observe in the data provide support for the model. We then discuss the plausibility of odd-eighth tick avoidance by market makers as a defense against SOES bandits.","['Eugene Kandel', 'Leslie M.

The impact of cash flow volatility on discretionary investment and the costs of debt and equity financing,"We show that higher cash flow volatility is associated with lower average levels of investment in capital expenditures, R&D, and advertising. This association suggests that firms do not use external capital markets to fully cover cash flow shortfalls but rather permanently forgo investment. Cash flow volatility also is associated with higher costs of accessing external capital. Moreover, these higher costs, as measured by some proxies, imply a greater sensitivity of investment to cash flow volatility. Thus, cash flow volatility not only increases the likelihood that a firm will need to access capital markets, it also increases the costs of doing so.","['Bernadette A.

Survivorship bias and attrition effects in measures of performance persistence,"We simulate standard tests of performance persistence using alternative return-generating processes, survival criteria, and test methodologies. When survival depends on performance over several periods, survivorship bias induces spurious reversals, despite the presence of cross-sectional heteroskedasticity in performance. Look-ahead biased methodologies and missing final returns typical of U.S. mutual fund datasets can also materially affect persistence measures. Our results reinforce previous findings that U.S. mutual fund performance is truly persistent. When fund performance is truly persistent, fund attrition affects persistence measures, even when the sample includes all nonsurvivor returns. We also examine the specification and power of the various persistence tests.","['Jennifer N. Carpenter', 'Anthony W.

Using genetic algorithms to find technical trading rules1,"We use a genetic algorithm to learn technical trading rules for the S&P 500 index using daily prices from 1928 to 1995. After transaction costs, the rules do not earn consistent excess returns over a simple buy-and-hold strategy in the out-of-sample test periods. The rules are able to identify periods to be in the index when daily returns are positive and volatility is low and out when the reverse is true. These latter results can largely be explained by low-order serial correlation in stock index returns.","['Franklin Allen', 'Risto Karjalainen']","['Trading rules', 'Genetic algorithms', 'Excess returns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X9800052X,Journal of Financial Economics,1999,51,2
Optimal choice of contracting methods: negotiated versus competitive underwritings revisited1,"We use a previously unexploited data base, specifically debt offerings by AT&T and its subsidiaries in the period 1970–1974, to examine the relative costliness of competitive and negotiated offerings. A sample based on the experience of a single issuer allows us to minimize the influence of agency considerations and differential riskiness of the issuers.

Predictive regressions,"When a rate of return is regressed on a lagged stochastic regressor, such as a dividend yield, the regression disturbance is correlated with the regressor's innovation. The OLS estimator's finite-sample properties, derived here, can depart substantially from the standard regression setting. Bayesian posterior distributions for the regression parameters are obtained under specifications that differ with respect to (i) prior beliefs about the autocorrelation of the regressor and (ii) whether the initial observation of the regressor is specified as fixed or stochastic. The posteriors differ across such specifications, and asset allocations in the presence of estimation risk exhibit sensitivity to those differences.",['Robert F.
