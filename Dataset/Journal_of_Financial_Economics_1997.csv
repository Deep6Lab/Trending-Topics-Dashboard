Nasdaq market structure and spread patterns,"Because of its institutional features, the Nasdaq market does not fit the standard competitive model. We construct a model that reflects the distinguishing characteristics of the Nasdaq market. This model implies that in dealer markets with a minimum price increment, competition among market-makers does not necessarily drive spreads down to the level of marginal cost. Using this result, we provide an explanation for the odd-eighth avoidance documented in Christie and Schultz (1994). We show that market-makers can use odd-tick avoidance as a coordination device to increase spreads. Evidence from Nasdaq supports our hypotheses.","['Eugene Kandel', 'Leslie M.

Information and contagion effects of bank loan-loss reserve announcements,"Consistent with an information-signaling perspective, negative and statistically significant announcement effects are associated with bank loan-loss reserve (LLR) announcements over the 1985–1990 period. Announcement effects differ between money-center and regional banks and also according to the nature of contemporaneous earnings and dividend disclosures. Moreover Information transfer or ‘contagion’ effects are present in that LLR announcements by regional banks decrease the value of both money-center banks and nonannouncing regional banks. These statistically significant contagion effects suggest a link between the asset quality characteristics of money-center and regional bank loan portfolios.","['Diane Scott Docking', 'Mark Hirschey', 'Elaine Jones']","['Information', 'Contagion', 'Banking', 'Loan-loss reserves']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X96008951,Journal of Financial Economics,1997,43,2
Limit orders and the alleged Nasdaq collusion,"Different methods are used by the NYSE/Amex and the Nasdaq to accomodate limit orders received from investors. This accounts for at least part of the excess of Nasdaq spreads over NYSE spreads, adjusted for trading volume, and is a factor in determining this excess that is independent of collusion on the Nasdaq. The spread-comparison evidence given by others to support their belief that there is collusion among market makers on the Nasdaq therefore overstates the probability of collusion and its significance if it exists.",['Harold Demsetz'],"['Stocks', 'Spreads', 'Financial', 'Nasdaq', 'Collusion']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000123,Journal of Financial Economics,1997,45,1
Industry costs of equity,Estimates of the cost of equity for industries are imprecise. Standard errors of more than 3.0% per year are typical for both the CAPM and the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993). These large standard errors are the result of(i) uncertainty about true factor risk premiums and (ii) imp ecise estimates of the loadings of industries on the risk factors. Estimates of the cost of equity for firms and projects are surely even less precise.,"['Eugene F. Fama', 'Kenneth R.

Ownership and operating performance of companies that go public,"Going public typically leads to a separation of managerial control and stock ownership, and potentially worsens managerial incentives. We document that the median ownership stake of officers and directors declines significantly from the year before going public to ten years later. Median operating return on assets also declines from the year before the offering to the end of the first year of public trading, but performance declines no further in ten years. In general, operating performance both within one year of the offering and during the first ten years of public trading is unrelated to ownership of officers and directors.","['Wayne H.

A case study of organizational form and risk shifting in the savings and loan industry,"I analyze the investment and funding strategies of two thrifts, one stock owned and one mutually owned, from 1983 to 1988. Despite their similarities prior to 1983, the stock thrift implemented a riskier financial strategy and did so only after converting to stock ownership. Although this strategy ultimately led to its failure, the stock thrift still made significant payouts to its controlling shareholders. This case study illustrates in stark terms the relation between organizational form and risk shifting in the thrift industry.",['Benjamin C.

The effects of equity issues on ownership structure and stock liquidity: A comparison of rights and public offerings,"I find that proportionate bid ask spreads increase after rights offerings of common stock, but decrease after public underwritten offerings. These changes are correlated with changes in the issuing firm's ownership structure. Public offerings cause greater dispersion in share ownership while rights offerings lead to more concentrated ownership. I argue that increased spreads represent a significant cost to issuing firms shareholders, making rights offerings costlier than public underwritten offerings for actively traded firms.",['Meeta Kothare'],"['Seasoned equity offerings', 'Rights offerings', 'Ownership structure', 'Bid ask spread', 'Liquidity']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X96008926,Journal of Financial Economics,1997,43,1
Organizational form and risk taking in the savings and loan industry,"I hypothesize that risk taking is greater in stock thrifts than in mutual thrifts because the residual and fixed claims are separable. I find that stock thrifts exhibit greater profit variability during the 1982–1988 period and that conversions from mutual to stock ownership are associated with increased investment in risky assets and increased profit variability. These findings illustrate the relation between the structure of residual claims, incentives, and firm performance as well as the unintended consequences resulting from changes in thrift regulations.",['Benjamin C.

Bounds on contingent claims based on several assets,"In 1987, Lo derived an upper bound on the price of a European call option on a single asset. Lo's bound depends only on the mean and variance of the terminal asset price and is termed a semi-parametric bound. This paper derives similar semi-parametric bounds on a European call on the maximum of any number of assets. A distribution-free bound for the price of this option is obtained. The bound depends only on the means and covariance matrix of the returns on n underlying assets. The bound is obtained by optimizing over the entries of a positive definite matrix A. This can be accomplished by a technique known as semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the methodology using two specific applications. The first concerns the valuation of a European call option on the maximum of several assets. This is known as an outperformance option and is of some practical interest. The second application concerns the valuation of a discretely adjusted lookback option. These lookback options are of interest in connection with certain equity annuity insurance products.","['Phelim P. Boyle', 'X.

Layoffs and underwritten rights offers,"In seasoned equity rights offers, the standby underwriting contract resembles the sale of a put option. In the rights offering period, underwriters reduce their exposure to the standby underwriting by purchasing rights hedged with short sale of the common stock. Consistent with Eckbo and Masulis (1992), offers with large rights sell-offs during the offering period experience significant price decline. The offering period price decline and the nature of constraints confronting underwriters may partially explain the preference for general public offers.",['Ajai K.

Investor behavior in mass privatization: The case of the Czech voucher scheme,"In the first round of the Czech privatization scheme, the authorities set a uniform share price for all companies, creating a natural experiment for testing several hypotheses concerning the determinants of share demand. We find a positive relation between first-round share demand and later stock market prices, supporting use of share demand to measure relative share values. We find that share demand is related to proxies for agency costs and the expected costs of financial distress. Interestingly, share demand is directly related to the percentage of shares held by insiders, which is relevant for the debate in former Communist countries over whether privatization programs should restrict insider holdings.","['Archana Hingorani', 'Kenneth Lehn', 'Anil K.

The complexity of compensation contracts,"Management compensation is often categorized as either sensitive or insensitive to firm performance. This one-dimensional treatment ignores the variation in the types and terms of compensation contracts. Through a cross-sectional examination of share-holder-authorized compensation arrangements, this paper demonstrates that the terms of stock option and restricted stock plans, and the flexibility afforded the board of directions in negotiating with managers, vary systematically with the characteristics of the assets being managed. This variation in compensation contracting challenges theorists to incorporate the richness of management contracts into models of incentive pay.",['Stacey R.

Mutual fund styles,"Mutual funds are typically grouped by their investment objectives or the ‘style’ of their managers. We propose a new empirical to the determination of manager ‘style’. This approach is simple to apply, yet it captures nonlinear patterns of returns that result from virtually all active portfolio management styles. Our classifications are superior to common industry classifications in predicting cross-sectional future performance, as well as past performance, and they also outperform classifications based on risk measures and analogue portfolios.

The importance of firm quotes and rapid executions: Evidence from the January 1994 SOES rules changes,"Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System (SOES) allows orders to be submitted by computer, thereby assuring rapid execution at quoted prices. We examine trading in the 20 largest Nasdaq stocks around the time of a rule change that reduced the largest SOES trades from 1000 to 500 shares. We show that SOES trades contain information about short-term price movements and that SOES trading declined dramatically with the rule change.

Capital market frictions and the role of internal capital markets in banking,"The extent to which banking firms face external financing costs when funding new loans has important implications for the role of banks in the corporate capital acquisition process, for the effectiveness of monetary policy and for the impact of capital requirements. We investigate this issue by examining the cash-flow sensitivity of loan growth at bank holding companies, and by examining the extent to which holding companies establish an internal capital market to allocate capital among their various subsidiaries. Overall, we find that loan growth at subsidiary banks is more sensitive to the holding company's cash flow and capital position than to the bank's own cash flow and capital. Moreover, we find that bank loan growth is negatively correlated with loan growth among the other subsidiaries within the holding company. Overall, this evidence suggests that bank holding companies establish internal capital markets to allocate scarce capital among their various subsidiaries.","['Joel Houston', 'Christopher James', 'David Marcus']","['Bank holding company', 'Internal capital markets', 'Capital allocations']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97815115,Journal of Financial Economics,1997,46,2
Do institutions receive comparable execution in the NYSE and Nasdaq markets?

We analyze three issues: (1) the frequencies of the sizes and types of block trades found in the two markets, (2) the immediate price effects of the block transactions, and (3) the temporary and permanent price effects of the blocks.

A multibeta representation theorem for linear asset pricing theories,"This paper derives a multibeta representation theorem for pricing assets using arbitrary reference variables that are not necessarily the true factors. Under this theorem, the upper bound on pricing deviations depends upon the correlations not only between the reference variables and the factors but also between the reference variables and the residual risks. A new concept of a well-diversified variable is introduced, which though free of residual risk, may be less than perfectly correlated with the true factors. Welldiversified variables correlated with the factors play a key role in the pricing of assets, since these variables can replace the factors without any loss in pricing accuracy under all linear asset pricing theories.",['Sanjay K.

We also incorporate learning so that firms adopting current innovations become better able to benefit from future innovations. The model yields four distinct investment strategies. The model is then used to predict actual firm policy. These implications are discussed and compared with observed firm behavior.","['Steven R. Grenadier', 'Allen M.

Corporate restructuring during performance declines in Japan,"This paper documents the restructuring of 92 Japanese corporations that experienced a substantial decline in operating performance between 1986 and 1990. These firms implement a number of downsizing measures such as asset sales, plant closures, and employee layoffs. Firms also expand and diversify, and often restructure their internal operations. Compared to US firms with a similar decline in performance, however, Japanese firms are less likely to downsize, and layoffs affect a smaller fraction of their workforce. The frequency of asset downsizing and layoffs in Japanese firms increases with the ownership by the firm's main bank and other blockholders. Blockholders also increase the probability of management turnover, outside director removals and outside director additions, but decrease the likelihood of acquisitions. We document improvements in operating performance following downsizing actions in Japan.","['Jun-Koo Kang', 'Anil Shivdasani']","['Restructuring', 'Financial distress', 'Japanese corporate governance', 'Ownership structure', 'Main bank system']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X9700024X,Journal of Financial Economics,1997,46,1
Bid-ask spreads and the avoidance of odd-eighth quotes on Nasdaq: An examination of exchange listings,"This paper examines 472 securities that were listed on Nasdaq and moved to the NYSE or Amex. When Nasdaq market makers avoid odd-eighth quotes, bid-ask spreads are large and decline dramatically with exchange listing. When market makers use both odd and even eighths, spreads are smaller and decline only slightly with exchange listing. The large spreads observed when Nasdaq market makers avoid odd-eighths cannot be explained by security-specific characteristics. Instead, the results support the conclusion that the avoidance of odd-eighth quotes is used as a coordination device among Nasdaq market makers to maintain supra-competitive bid-ask spreads.",['Michael J.

Guaranty funds and risk-taking evidence from the insurance industry,"This paper examines change in property-liability insurers' risk-taking around enactments of state guaranty fund laws. Our evidence suggests that the risk of insurers' asset portfolios increases following enactments. But this increase in risk is significant only for stock insurers. Our evidence of increased risk-taking following guaranty-fund adoptions suggests that the way these funds are organized creates counterproductive investment incentives, especially for stock companies. Because these laws were enacted by states over the period 1969–1981, our evidence on changes in risk-taking helps resolve statistical problems that have been troublesome for studies of bank deposit insurance.","['Soon-Jae Lee', 'David Mayers', 'Clifford W.

Returns to contrarian investment strategies: Tests of naive expectations hypotheses,"This paper examines the ability of naive investor expectations models to explain the higher returns to contrarian investment strategies. Contrary to Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), we find no systematic evidence that stock prices reflect naive extrapolation of past trends in earnings and sales growth. Building on Bauman and Dowen (1988) and La Porta (1995), however, we find that stock prices appear to naively reflect analysts' biased forecasts of future earnings growth. Further, we find that naive reliance on analysts' forecasts of future earnings growth can explain over half of the higher returns to contrarian investment strategies.","['Patricia M.

The resulting interest rate and stock price dynamics are empirically plausible. Moreover, our stock option pricing formula with stochastic volatility and interest rates can reconcile certain puzzling empirical regularities, including the volatility smile.","['Gurdip S.

Existing models predicting that foreign investors hold national market portfolios or portfolios tilted towards stocks with high expected returns are inconsistent with our evidence. We document that foreign investors hold disproportionately more shares of firms in manufacturing industries, large firms, and firms with good accounting performance, low unsystematic risk, and low leverage. Controlling for size, there is evidence that small firms that export more firms with greater share turnover, and firms that have ADRs have greater foreign ownership.","['Jun-Koo Kang', 'Rene´M.

We find that, beginning in August 1993, the estimated option value was persistently negative on nearly every day for the ensuing eight months. We show that the anomalous pricing behavior arose because the underlying callable bond became the cheapest to deliver issue against U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts.

We provide an approach that allows the relative importance of world and local information to change through time in both the expected returns and conditional variance processes. Our time-series and cross-sectional models analyze the reasons that volatility is different across emerging markets, particularly with respect to the timing of capital market reforms. We find that capital market liberalizations often increase the correlation between local market returns and the world market but do not drive up local market volatility.","['Geert Bekaert', 'Campbell R.

"Valuation uncertainty, institutional involvement, and the underpricing of IPOs: The case of REITs","Unlike operating company IPOs, Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) IPOs in the 1970s and 1980s were initially overpriced and subsequently underperformed other REIT securities in the 100 trading days after initial issuance. In contrast. equity REIT IPOs in the 1990s have been underpriced. on average by 3.6%. and have moderately outperformed seasoned equity REITs in the 100 trading days after issuance. We attribute the initial-day underpricing of recent REIT IPOs to greater valuation uncertainty and greater institutional involvement in the recent REIT IPO market. Both of these factors make these issues more susceptible to the ‘winner's curse’.","['David C.

Privatization and efficiency: Industry effects of the sale of British Airways,"We analyze the effect of privatization on the performance of British Airways by examining the privatization's impact on airfares and competitors' stock prices. We find that stock prices of U.S. competitors fell a significant 7% upon British Airways' privatization, implying expectation of a more competitive British Airways. Closer rivals of British Airways experienced a greater drop in stock price than more distant rivals. Further, airfares in markets served by British Airways fell significantly upon privatization. The results suggest that a change from government to private ownership improves economic efficiency.","['Catherine Eckel', 'Doug Eckel', 'Vijay Singal']","['Privatization', 'Ownership', 'Airlines', 'British Airways']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X96008938,Journal of Financial Economics,1997,43,2
Detecting long-run abnormal stock returns: The empirical power and specification of test statistics,"We analyze the empirical power and specification of test statistics in event studies designed to detect long-run (one- to five-year) abnormal stock returns. We document that test statistics based on abnormal returns calculated using a reference portfolio, such as a market index, are misspecified (empirical rejection rates exceed theoretical rejection rates) and identify three reasons for this misspecification. We correct for the three identified sources of misspecification by matching sample firms to control firms of similar sizes and book-to-market ratios. This control firm approach yields well-specified test statistics in virtually all sampling situations considered.","['Brad M. Barber', 'John D.

The decline of takeovers and disciplinary managerial turnover,"We compare top management turnover in unacquired U.S. industrial companies during an active takeover market (1984–1988) and a less active takeover market (1989–1993). For firms in the lowest quartile of performance (measured by operating income scaled by assets). 33% experience complete turnover of the president, CEO, and board chair during the active takeover period and only 17% experience complete turnover during the less active period. Controlling for various determinants of management turnover, we provide evidence that turnover and performance are related only in the active takeover period, and conclude that takeover activity affects the intensity of managerial discipline.","['Wayne H.

On biases in tests of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates,We document extreme bias and dispersion in the small-sample distributions of four standard regression-based tests of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates. The biases arise because of the extreme persistence in short interest rates. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the biases under a simple first-order autoregressive data generating process for the short rate. We then conduct Monte Carlo experiments based on a bias-adjusted first-order autoregressive process for the short rate and for a more realistic bias-adjusted VAR-GARCH model incorporating the short rate and three term spreads. Conducting inference with the small-sample distributions of test statistics rather than with their asymptotic distributions provides a more consistent rejection of the expectations hypothesis. Plausible sources of measurement error in short and long yields do not salvage the expectations hypothesis.,"['Geert Bekaert', 'Robert J. Hodrick', 'David A.

Share price and mortality: An empirical evaluation of newly listed Nasdaq stocks,"We examine a sample of 5896 stocks listed on Nasdaq between 1974 and 1988 to see whether the price per share has significant statistical power in forecasting subsequent returns and attrition rates. Consistent with anecdotal evidence, we document a higher mortality rate for lower-priced stocks than for higher-priced issues. Surprisingly, mortality is not related to market capitalization. Our results also hold for subsamples partitioned by industry and issue year. On average, investors are not adequately compensated for this additional mortality risk, earning lower risk-adjusted rates of return on portfolios of lower-priced shares than on portfolios of higher-priced shares.","['P.J.

A cross-exchange comparison of execution costs and information flow for NYSE-listed stocks,"We examine execution costs for trades in NYSE issues completed on the NYSE, the NASD dealer market, and the regional stock exchanges during 1994. We find that effective bid-ask spreads are only slightly smaller at the NYSE. However, realized bid-ask spreads, which measure market-making revenue net of losses to betterinformed traders but gross of inventory or order-processing costs, are lower on the NYSE by a factor of two to three. This differential is attributable to the successful ‘cream skimming’ of uninformed trades by off-NYSE market makers. These findings reinforce existing concerns about whether orders are routed so as to receive the best possible execution.","['Hendrik Bessembinder', 'Herbert M.

Why underwrite rights offerings? Some new evidence,"We examine rights issues on the Oslo Stock Exchange, where seasoned public offerings now take place almost exclusively through use of the relatively expensive standby underwriting method rather than unsinsured rights. We show that the propensity to use standby underwriting increases as expected shareholder takeup decreases, that the market reaction to uninsured rights offers is significantly positive, and that standbys elicit the least favorable market reaction to the public issue announcement. These and other cross-sectional results are consistent with the asymmetric information framework of Eckbo and Masulis (1992) and help resolve the longstanding rights offer paradox.","['Øyvind Bøhren', 'B.

On the measurement of Tobin's q,"We examine the methods commonly employed to estimate Tobin's q ratios and find them to be flawed in design and arbitrary in implementation. We propose an alternative procedure which is both simpler and more accurate. The key to the procedure is an improved measure of fixed asset replacement costs, through the proper identification of the vintages of fixed assets that are in place for a firm. Application of this procedure to a large sample of nonfinancial corporations indicates that existing methods generally produce downward-biased measures of q and can result in errors in the ordering of firms by their q's.","['Wilbur G.

Executive stock ownership and performance tracking faint traces,"We examine the relation between managers' financial interests and firm performance. Since the relation could go in either direction, we cast the analysis in a simultaneous equations framework. For firms involved in acquisitions, we find that acquisition performance and Tobin's Q ratios affect the size of managers' stockholdings. We find no evidence, however, that larger stockholdings lead to better performance. Perhaps management is effectively disciplined by competition in product and labor markets. Alternatively, it may not be necessary for top executives to own stock to be residual claimants. And finally, higher ownership might multiply the opportunities to appropriate corporate wealth.","['Claudio Loderer', 'Kenneth Martin']","['Executive stock ownership', 'Firm performance', 'Corporate acquisitions', 'Q ratios']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000172,Journal of Financial Economics,1997,45,2
Do independent directors enhance target shareholder wealth during tender offers?,"We examine the role of the target firm's independent outside directors during takeover attempts by tender offer. We find that when the target's board is independent, the initial tender offer premium, the bid premium revision, and the target shareholder gains over the entire tender offer period are higher, and that the presence of a poison pill and takeover resistance lead to greater premiums and shareholder gains. We conclude that independent outside directors enhance target shareholder gains from tender offers, and that boards with a majority of independent directors are more likely to use resistance strategies to enhance shareholder wealth.","['James F.

"Book-to-market, dividend yield, and expected market returns: A time-series analysis","We find reliable evidence that both book-to-market (B M) and dividend yield track time-series variation in expected real stock returns over the period 1926 91 (in which B M is stronger) and the subperiod 1941–1991 (in which dividend yield is stronger). A Bayesian bootstrap procedure implies that an investor with prior belief 0.5 that expected returns on the equal-weighted index are never negative comes away from the full-period B/M evidence with posterior probability 0.08 for the hypothesis (0.14 with the impact of the 1933 outlier tempered). Although this raises doubts about market efficiency, the post-1940 evidence is consistent with expected returns always being positive.","['S.P.

Do strategic alliances create value?,"We investigate share price responses to the formation of 345 strategic alliances spanning 1983–1992. The average stock price response is positive, with no evidence of wealth transfers. This is true for horizontal alliances (involving partner firms in industries with the same three-digit SIC codes) as well as non-horizontal alliances. For horizontal alliances, more value accrues when the alliance involves the transfer or pooling of technical knowledge than with nontechnical alliances. Finally, partnering firms tend to display better operating performance than their industry peers over the five-year period surrounding the year in which an alliance is formed.","['Su Han Chan', 'John W.

"Inside directors, board effectiveness, and shareholder wealth","We investigate whether inside managers are added to corporate boards for efficiency or entrenchment purposes. Our examination of inside director appointments finds that the stock-market reaction to the announcement is significantly negative when inside directors own less than 5% of the firm's common stock, significantly positive when their ownership level is between 5% and 25%, and insignificantly different from zero when ownership exceeds 25%. These results suggest that the expected benefits of an inside director's expert knowledge clearly out weigh the expected costs of managerial entrenchment only when managerial and outside shareholder interests are closely aligned.","['Stuart Rosenstein', 'Jeffrey G.

Return autocorrelation and institutional investors,"We propose and test the hypothesis that trading by institutional investors contributes to serial correlation in daily returns. Our results demonstrate that NYSE particles and individual security daily return autocorrelationsare an increasing function of the level of institutional ownership. Moreover, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that institutional trading reflects information and increases the speed of price adjustment. The relation between autocorrelation and institutional holdings does not, however, apparent to be driven by market frictions or rational time-varying required rates of return. We conclude that institutional investors correlated trading patterns contribute to axial correlation in daily returns.","['Richard W. Sias', 'Laura T.

Ownership structure and top executive turnover,"We report that ownership structure significantly affects the likelihood of a change in top executive. Controlling for stock price performance, the probability of top executive turnover is negatively related to the ownership stake of officers and directors and positively related to the presence of an outside blockholder. In addition, the likehood of a change in top executive is significantly less sensitive to stock price performance in firms with higher managerial ownership. Finally, we document an unusually high rate of corporate control activity in the twelve months preceding top executive turnover. We conclude that ownership structure has an important influence on internal monitoring efforts and that this influence stems in part from the effect of ownership structure on external control threats.","['David J.

The determinants of organizational form changes: evidence and implications from real estate,"We study changes in the real estate industry among organizational forms with varying degrees of restrictiveness and document the associated changes in profitability, free cash flow, debt, dividends, and investment policies. All troubled firms in our sample move to a more flexible organizational structure, with subsequent reductions in dividends, improvements in performance, and increases in asset sales and investments. Healthy firms that move to a tighter structure have larger free cash flows before the change; they increase dividends, reduce free cash flows and improve profitability after the change. We document evidence of tax considerations in organizational changes.","['Aswath Damodaran', 'Kose John', 'Crocker H.

Corporate focus and value creation evidence from spinoffs,"We test a prediction from the corporate focus literature that cross-industry spinoff distributions, where the continuing and spunoff units belong to different two-digit Standard Industry Classification codes, create more value than own-industry spinoffs. Our results indicate significant value creation around the announcement of cross-industry spinoffs only. We then provide evidence on whether the value creation comes from operating performance improvements, or bonding benefits, or both, where bonding refers to a pre-commitment by managers to avoid cross-subsidizing relatively poor performing units within the firm. We find a significant improvement in operating performance for cross-industry spinoffs, and none for own-industry cases. We do not find strong evidence of bonding to explain spinoff-related value creation. Further, the operating performance improvement is associated with the continuing rather than the spunoff entity, consistent with the hypothesis that spinoffs create value by removing unrelated businesses and allowing managers to focus attention on the core operations they are best suited to manage.","['Lane Daley', 'Vikas Mehrotra', 'Ranjini Sivakumar']","['Spinoff', 'Divestiture', 'Focus', 'Cross-subsidization']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X97000184,Journal of Financial Economics,1997,45,2
