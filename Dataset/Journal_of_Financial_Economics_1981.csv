Risk and return on long-lived tangible assets,"Assuming rational expectations, a specialization of Ross' Arbitrage Pricing Theory is used to obtain a simple securities market valuation formula when dividends follow linear stochastic processes. The implications of this model for the use of accounting data to measure risk and for capital budgeting are explored. A new measure of riskiness based on accounting data is derived, and the use of risk-adjusted discount rates is evaluated.",['Richard Schmalensee'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8190012X,Journal of Financial Economics,1981,9,2
On the valuation of American call options on stocks with known dividends,"Both the Roll and the Geske equations for the valuation of the American call option on a stock with known dividends are incorrectly specified.

The consumption based asset pricing model,"Breeden's demonstration that Merton's multi-beta capital asset pricing model can be collapsed into a single-beta model where betas are computed with respect to aggregate consumption is an important theoretical advance. Nonetheless, Breeden's model retains many of the empirical problems that beset Merton's earlier version. In general the consumption betas will be nonstationary, so that the state variables must be observable for the model to be estimated.",['Bradford Cornell'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X81900222,Journal of Financial Economics,1981,9,1
A model of international asset pricing,"In this paper an intertemporal model of international asset pricing is constructed which admits differences in consumption opportunity sets across countries. It is shown that the real expected excess return on a risky asset is proportional to the covariance of the return of that asset with changes in the world real consumption rate. (World real consumption does not, in general, correspond to a basket of commodities consumed by all investors.) The model has no barriers to international investment, but it is compatible with empirical facts which contradict the predictions of earlier models and which seem to imply that asset markets are internationally segmented.",['RenéM.

Does the investment interest limitation explain the existence of dividends?,Miller and Scholes have shown that under certain conditions the Federal Income Tax taxes dividend income at a rate no higher than the rate on capital gains. Tabulations of actual 1977 tax returns show that the special circumstances under which this can occur apply to recipients of two and one half percent of dividend income and that no dominant role may therefore be ascribed to their hypothesis in the determination of corporate dividend policy.,['Daniel Feenberg'],[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X81900283,Journal of Financial Economics,1981,9,3
Assimilating earnings and split information,"Recent studies have implied that the capital market has become more efficient with respect to the announcements of stock splits and corporate earnings. This study calculated residual returns associated with these announcements and then tested, by time period (early and late years), for a between period difference. The results suggest that for certain earnings and split announcements the market is no more efficient than it has been in the past.","['William D. Nichols', 'Stewart L.

Optimal dealer pricing under transactions and return uncertainty,"The paper examines the optimal behavior of a single dealer who is faced with a stochastic demand to trade (modeled by a continuous time Poisson jump process) and facing return risk on his stock and on the rest of his portfolio (modeled by diffusion processes). Using stochastic dynamic programming, we derive the optimal bid and ask prices that maximize the dealer's expected utility of terminal wealth as a function of the state in which he finds himself. The relationship of the bid and ask prices to inventory of the dealer, instantaneous variance of return, stochastic arrival of transactions and other variables is examined.","['Thomas Ho', 'Hans R.

Convertible calls and security returns,"The study examines the impact of convertible security calls on securityholder's wealth. On average common stock values fall by approximately two percent at the announcements of convertible debt calls, but common stockholder's wealth is unaffected by convertible preferred stock calls. These findings are consistent with a corporate tax effect. A small average decrease in firm value is also found at the announcements of convertible debt calls. The study raises, but leaves unanswered, the interesting question of what motivates managers to make capital structure decisions that reduce stockholder wealth and firm value.",['Wayne H.

"Risky debt, jump processes, and safety covenants",The usual assumptions in the continuous-time contingent claims pricing of risky debt are (1) the firm is in default only when the value of its remaining assets falls short of the currently due promised payment and (2) the firm value follows continuous diffusion-process dynamics. It is the joint relaxation of these two simplifying assumptions that motivate this paper in its study of the valuation of risky debt and safety covenants when the firm value follows (possibly) discontinuous sample paths. Explicit solutions are derived and compared to the work of Black and Cox (1976).,"['Scott P.

Information aggregation in a noisy rational expectations economy,"This paper analyzes a general equilibrium model of a competitive security market in which traders possess independent pieces of information about the return of a risky asset. Each trader conditions his estimate of the return both on his own private source of information and price, which in equilibrium serves as a ‘noisy’ aggregator of the total information observed by all traders. A closed-form characterization of the rational expectations equilibrium is presented. A counter-example to the existence of ‘fully revealing’ equilibrium is developed.","['Douglas W.

Valuation of risky assets in arbitrage-free economies with transactions costs,"This paper analyzes the equilibrium valuation of risky assets in the case where transactions costs are present. The methodology involves applying ‘theorems of the alternative’ (Farkas' Lemma) as a consequence of arbitrage-free markets. Under relevant assumptions, it is found that the price of an asset having transactions costs is the corresponding price that would obtain in a perfect market, plus a ‘fudge factor’. This latter factor is provided explicit bounds.","['Mark B. Garman', 'James A.

The relation between forward prices and futures prices,"This paper consolidates the results of some recent work on the relation between forward prices and futures prices. It develops a number of propositions characterizing the two prices. These propositions contain several testable implications about the difference between forward and futures prices. Many of the propositions show that equilibrium forward and futures prices are equal to the values of particular assets, even though they are not in themselves asset prices. The paper then illustrates these results in the context of two valuation models and discusses the effects of taxes and other institutional factors.","['John C. Cox', 'Jonathan E.

Option pricing in a lognormal securities market with discrete trading,"This paper derives a call option valuation equation assuming discrete trading in securities markets where the underlying asset and market returns are bivariate lognormally distributed and investors have increasing, concave utility functions exhibiting skewness preference. Since the valuation does not require the continouus time riskfree hedging of Black and Scholes, nor the discrete time riskfree hedging of Cox, Ross and Rubinstein, market effects are introduced into the option valuation relation. The new option valuation seems to correct for the systematic mispricing of well-in and well-out of the money options by the Black and Scholes option pricing formula.","['Wayne Y. Lee', 'Ramesh K.S.

Common stock repurchases,"This paper examines the effects of a common stock repurchase on the values of the repurchasing firm's common stock, debt and preferred stock, and attempts to identify the dominant factors underlying the observed value changes. The evidence indicates that significant increases in firm values occur within one day of a stock repurchase announcement. These value changes appear to be due principally to an information signal from the repurchasing firm. Common stockholders are the beneficiaries of virtually all of the value increments, but no class of securities examined declines in value as a result of the repurchase.",['Larry Y.

Common stock repurchases and market signalling,"This paper examines the pricing behavior of securities of firms which repurchase their own shares. The results are consistent with a market in which investors price securities such that expected arbitrage profits are precluded. The results are also consistent with the hypothesis that firms offer premia for their own shares mainly in order to signal positive information, and that the market uses the premium, the target fraction and the fraction of insider holdings as signals in order to price securities around the announcement date. The observation that repurchases via tender offer are followed by abnormal increases in earnings per share and that mainly small firms engage in repurchase tender offers, provides further support for the signalling hypothesis.",['Theo Vermaelen'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X81900118,Journal of Financial Economics,1981,9,2
A continuous time equilibrium model of forward prices and futures prices in a multigood economy,"This paper is a theoretical investigation of equilibrium forward and futures prices. We construct a rational expectations model in continuous time of a multigood, identical consumer economy with constant stochastic returns to scale production. Using this model we find three main results. First, we find formulas for equilibrium forward, futures, discount bond, commodity bond and commodity option prices. Second, we show that a futures price is actually a forward price for the delivery of a random number of units of a good; the random number is the return earned from continuous reinvestment in instantaneously riskless bonds until maturity of the futures contract. Third, we find and interpret conditions under which normal backwardation or contango is found in forward or futures prices; these conditions reflect the usefulness of forward and futures contracts as consumption hedges.","['Scott F.

Forward contracts and futures contracts,"This paper provides a detailed discussion of the similarities and differences between forward contracts and futures contracts. Under frictionless markets and continuous trading, simple arbitrage arguments are invoked to value forward contracts, to relate forward prices and spot prices, and to relate forward prices and futures prices. We also argue that forward prices need not equal futures prices unless default free interest rates are deterministic.","['Robert A. Jarrow', 'George S.

Misspecification of capital asset pricing,"This study documents empirical anomalies which suggest that either the simple one-period capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is misspecified or that capital markets are inefficient. In particular, portfolios based on firm size or earnings/price (E/P) ratios experience average returns systematically different from those predicted by the CAPM. Furthermore, the ‘abnormal’ returns persist for at least two years. This persistence reduces the likelihood that these results are being generated by a market inefficiency. Rather, the evidence seems to indicate that the equilibrium pricing model is misspecified. However, the data also reveals that an E/P effect does not emerge after returns are controlled for the firm size effect; the firm size effect largely subsumes the E/P effect. Thus, while the E/P anomaly and value anomaly exist when each variable is considered separately, the two anomalies seem to be related to the same set of missing factors, and these factors appear to be more closely associated with firm size than E/P ratios.",['Marc R.

The relationship between return and market value of common stocks,"This study examines the empirical relationship between the return and the total market value of NYSE common stocks. It is found that smaller firms have had higher risk adjusted returns, on average, than larger firms. This ‘size effect’ has been in existence for at least forty years and is evidence that the capital asset pricing model is misspecified. The size effect is not linear in the market value; the main effect occurs for very small firms while there is little difference in return between average sized and large firms. It is not known whether size per se is responsible for the effect or whether size is just a proxy for one or more true unknown factors correlated with size.",['Rolf W.

Comments on Whaley's note,"Valuation by duplication is a useful conceptual technique but it does not yield unique formula. Many duplicating portfolios, some simpler than the three security portfolio in Roll and Whaley, exist for this problem. Valuing the actual single security will generally yield conceptually and computationally simpler solutions.",['Robert Geske'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X81900143,Journal of Financial Economics,1981,9,2
