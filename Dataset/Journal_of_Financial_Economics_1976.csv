The option pricing model and the risk factor of stock,In this paper a combined capital asset pricing model and option pricing model is considered and then applied to the derivation of equity's value and its systematic risk. In the first section we develop the two models and present some newly found properties of the option pricing model. The second section is concerned with the effects of these properties on the securityholders of firms with less than perfect ‘me first’ rules. We show how unanticipated changes in firm capital and asset structures can differentially affect the firm's debt and equity. In the final section of the paper we consider a number of theoretical and empirical implications of the joint model. These include investment policy as well as the causes and effects of non-stationarity in the systematic risk of levered equity and risky debt.,"['Dan Galai', 'Ronald W.

Capital market seasonality: The case of stock returns,"In this paper we present evidence on the existence of seasonality in monthly rates of return on the New York Stock Exchange from 1904–1974. With the exception of the 1929–1940 period, there are statistically significant differences in mean returns among months due primarily to large January returns. Dispersion measures reveal no consistent seasonal patterns and the characteristic exponent seems invariant among months. We also explore possible implications of the observed seasonality for the capital asset pricing model and other research.","['Michael S. Rozeff', 'William R.

Sharing rules and equilibrium in an international capital market under uncertainty,"International capital market equilibrium is characterized for a world economy in which consumption preferences are defined multiplicatively over many commodities. It is shown that the set of relative asset prices under pure exchange in international capital markets depends on the real purchasing power of nominal payoffs under uncertainty and does not depend on the currency in which the nominal payoffs are denominated. A Sharpe-Lintner type international capital asset pricing model is derived as a special case. Proportional ad valorem commodity taxes and transportation costs are incorporated in the valuation model, interest rate parity and purchasing power parity are reinterpreted under uncertainty, and international differences in borrowing and lending are shown to reflect, in part, differences in risk aversion across countries.","['Frederick L.A.

Market microstructure,"It is assumed that a collection of market agents can be treated as a statistical ensemble. Their market activities are depicted as the stochastic generation of market orders according to a Poisson process. The objective is to effectively describe the ‘temporal microstructure’, or moment-to-moment trading activities in asset markets. Two basic models, ‘dealership’ vs. ‘auction’ markets (and their variants) are put forth. Implications are drawn from each model. The implications include several testable hypotheses regarding the aggregate behavior of markets and market-makers as well as some qualitative insight into the transaction-to-transaction nature of realistic exchange processes.",['Mark B.

Explicit solutions to some single-period investment problems for risky log-stable stocks,"Numerical approximations are presented for the expected utility of wealth over a single time period for a small investor who proportions her or his available capital between a risk-free asset and a risky stock. The stock price is assumed to be a log-stable random variable. The utility functional is logarithmic or isoeleastic (yaq, q < 0). Analytic results are presented for special choices of model parameters, and for large and small time periods.",['B.W.

Option pricing,"Recent advances in the general equilibrium pricing of simple put and call options lay the foundation for the development of a general theory of the valuation of contingent claims assets. This paper provides a review of: (1) the development of the general equilibrium option pricing model by Black and Scholes, and the subsequent modifications of this model by Merton and others; (2) the empirical verification of these models; and (3) applications of these models to value other contingent claim assets such as the debt and equity of a levered firm and dual purpose mutual funds.",['Clifford W.

The pricing of commodity contracts,"The contract price on a forward contract stays fixed for the life of the contract, while a futures contract is rewritten every day. The value of a futures contract is zero at the start of each day. The expected change in the futures price satisfies a formula like the capital asset pricing model. If changes in the futures price are independent of the return on the market, the futures price is the expected spot price. The futures market is not unique in its ability to shift risk, since corporations can do that too. The futures market is unique in the guidance it provides for producers, distributors, and users of commodities. Using assumptions like those used in deriving the original option formula, we find formulas for the values of forward contracts and commodity options in terms of the futures price and other variables.",['Fischer Black'],[],[],January–March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X76900246,Journal of Financial Economics,1976,3,1
Option pricing when underlying stock returns are discontinuous,"The validity of the classic Black-Scholes option pricing formula depends on the capability of investors to follow a dynamic portfolio strategy in the stock that replicates the payoff structure to the option. The critical assumption required for such a strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock return dynamics can be described by a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In this paper, an option pricing formula is derived for the more-general case when the underlying stock returns are generated by a mixture of both continuous and jump processes. The derived formula has most of the attractive features of the original Black-Scholes formula in that it does not depend on investor preferences or knowledge of the expected return on the underlying stock. Moreover, the same analysis applied to the options can be extended to the pricing of corporate liabilities.",['Robert C.

The pricing of equity-linked life insurance policies with an asset value guarantee,This paper considers the equilibrium pricing of equity-linked life insurance policies with an asset value guarantee; such policies provide for benefits which depend upon the performance of a reference portfolio subject to a minimum guaranteed benefit. The benefit is decomposed into a sure amount and an immediately exercisable call option on the reference portfolio. A numerical procedure for determining the value of the call option is presented and the risk minimizing investment strategy to be followed by the issuer of the policy is derived.,"['Michael J.

The effect of estimation risk on optimal portfolio choice,"This paper determines the effect of estimation risk on optimal portfolio choice under uncertainty. In most realistic problems, the parameters of return distributions are unknown and are estimated using available economic data. Traditional analysis neglects estimation risk by treating the estimated parameters as if they were the true parameters to determine the optimal choice under uncertainty. We show that for normally distributed returns and ‘non-informative’ or ‘invariant’ priors, the admissible set of portfolios taking the estimation uncertainty into account is identical to that given by traditional analysis. However, as a result of estimation risk, the optimal portfolio choice differs from that obtained by traditional analysis. For other plausible priors, the admissible set, and consequently the optimal choice, is shown to differ from that in traditional analysis.","['Roger W. Klein', 'Vijay S.

The valuation of options for alternative stochastic processes,"This paper examines the structure of option valuation problems and develops a new technique for their solution. It also introduces several jump and diffusion processes which have not been used in previous models. The technique is applied to these processes to find explicit option valuation formulas, and solutions to some previously unsolved problems involving the pricing of securities with payouts and potential bankruptcy.","['John C.

"Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure","This paper integrates elements from the theory of agency, the theory of property rights and the theory of finance to develop a theory of the ownership structure of the firm. We define the concept of agency costs, show its relationship to the ‘separation and control’ issue, investigate the nature of the agency costs generated by the existence of debt and outside equity, demonstrate who bears these costs and why, and investigate the Pareto optimality of their existence. We also provide a new definition of the firm, and show how our analysis of the factors influencing the creation and issuance of debt and equity claims is a special case of the supply side of the completeness of markets problem.","['Michael C.

An algebra for evaluating hedge portfolios,"This paper introduces a new tool, an ‘algebra’, for analyzing hedge portfolios. A hedge portfolio is defined as comprising PL- (for ‘piecewise linear’) options. The PL-option serves as a unifying concept for describing long and short positions in an unlying security and various options on that security. Additionally, piecewise linear taxes, margin requirements, transactions costs, etc., are all easily incorporated into the PL-option framework. A key result in this integrated treatment of hedge portfolios is the generation of necessary and sufficient rational option pricing theorems. Other applications of the algebra include the topics of option valuation, mean-variance analysis, and options-on-options.",['Mark B.

A theoretical and empirical investigation of the dual purpose funds,"Using the option pricing methods developed by Black and Scholes as a general technique for contingent claims analysis, this paper examines a class of mutual funds known as Dual Purpose Funds. By constructing a simplified model for these funds under the ‘perfect hedge’ conditions of Black and Scholes, it is demonstrated that the asset value of the fund will always exceed the market value and that it is not inconsistent with market equilibrium or efficiency for the capital shares to sell at a discount. The simple model predicts price fluctuations in the seven dual funds studied quite well; however, there is a persistent downward bias in the predicted price level. Finally, refinements to the model are examined to determine the nature of the misspecification causing this bias.",['Jonathan E.

Corporate pension funding policy,"What policy should a corporation adopt concerning the funding of a defined-benefit pension plan and the investment of the assets held in trust for the plan? Until recently, pension plans did not have to be insured, and some risk could be borne by intended beneficiaries. Federal legislation has now mandated such coverage. This paper analyzes corporate policy under three conditions which correspond, roughly, to the earlier situation (‘uninsure’ loans), the current situation (‘partially insured’ loans), and the situation required by law to be implemented in the future (‘completely insured’ plans). We show that if insurance premiums are set correctly, corporate policy in this area may not matter; otherwise the optimal policy may simply be that which maximizes the difference between the value of the insurance and its cost.",['William F.

Forward rates as predictors of future spot rates,"When adjusted for variation through time in expected premiums, the forward rates of interest that are implicit in Treasury Bill prices contain assessments of expected future spot rates of interest that are about as good as those that can be obtained from the information in past spot rates. Moreover, in setting bill prices and forward rates, the market reacts appropriately to the negative autocorrelation in monthly changes in the spot rate and to changes through time in the degree of this autocorrelation. This evidence is consistent with the market efficiency proposition that in setting bill prices, the market correctly uses the information in past spot rates.",['Eugene F.
