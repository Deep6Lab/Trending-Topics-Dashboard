News related to future GDP growth as a risk factor in equity returns,"A model that includes a factor that captures news related to future Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth along with the market factor can explain the cross-section of equity returns about as well as the Fama-French model can. Furthermore, the Fama-French factors HML and SMB appear to contain mainly news related to future GDP growth. When news related to future GDP growth is present in the asset-pricing model, HML and SMB lose much of their ability to explain the cross-section.",['Maria Vassalou'],"['Asset pricing', 'News', 'Future gdp', 'Gmm']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002489,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,1
Boundaries of the firm: evidence from the banking industry,"Agency theory implies that asset ownership and decision authority are complements. Using 1998 data from Texas commercial banks, we test whether the likelihood of local ownership of bank offices increases with the importance of granting local managers greater decision authority (for example, due to location or customer base). Our empirical evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. It suggests that complementarities between strategy and organizational structure can foster differentiation among firms in terms of location, customers, and products. It also supports the growing view that small locally-owned banks have a comparative advantage over large banks within specific environments.","['James A Brickley', 'James S Linck', 'Clifford W Smith']","['Boundaries of the firm', 'Banking', 'Economics of organizations', 'Ownership incentives', 'Agency theory', 'Decision authority', 'Locational decisions', 'Riegle–Neal Act', 'Community banks', 'Interstate branching']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001703,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,70,3
Likelihood-based specification analysis of continuous-time models of the short-term interest rate,"An extensive collection of continuous-time models of the short-term interest rate is evaluated over data sets that have appeared previously in the literature. The analysis, which uses the simulated maximum likelihood procedure proposed by Durham and Gallant (2002), provides new insights regarding several previously unresolved questions. For single factor models, I find that the volatility, not the drift, is the critical component in model specification. Allowing for additional flexibility beyond a constant term in the drift provides negligible benefit. While constant drift would appear to imply that the short rate is nonstationary, in fact, stationarity is volatility-induced. The simple constant elasticity of volatility model fits weekly observations of the three-month Treasury bill rate remarkably well but is easily rejected when compared with more flexible volatility specifications over daily data. The methodology of Durham and Gallant can also be used to estimate stochastic volatility models. While adding the latent volatility component provides a large improvement in the likelihood for the physical process, it does little to improve bond-pricing performance.",['Garland B.

Debtor-in-possession financing and bankruptcy resolution: Empirical evidence,"Debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing is unique secured financing available to firms filing for Chapter 11. Opponents of DIP financing argue that it leads to overinvestment. Alternatively, DIP financing can allow funding for positive net present value projects that increase the likelihood of reorganization and reduce time in bankruptcy. Using a large sample of bankruptcy filings, we find little evidence of systematic overinvestment. DIP financed firms are more likely to emerge from Chapter 11 than non-DIP financed firms. DIP financed firms have a shorter reorganization period; they are quicker to emerge and also quicker to liquidate. The reorganization period is even shorter when prior lenders provide the DIP financing.","['Sandeep Dahiya', 'Kose John', 'Manju Puri', 'Gabriel Ramı́rez']","['Chapter 11', 'Bankruptcy', 'Debtor-in-possession financing']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001132,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,1
"Culture, openness, and finance","Differences in culture, proxied by differences in religion and language, cannot be ignored when examining why investor protection differs across countries. We show that a country's principal religion predicts the cross-sectional variation in creditor rights better than a country's natural openness to international trade, its language, its income per capita, or the origin of its legal system. Catholic countries protect the rights of creditors less well than Protestant countries. A country's natural openness to international trade mitigates the influence of religion on creditor rights. Culture proxies are also helpful in understanding how investor rights are enforced across countries.","['René M.

Divisional diversity and the conglomerate discount: evidence from spinoffs,"Existing literature argues that disparity in investment opportunities within diversified firms can erode firm value. We investigate the diversity cost hypothesis of spinoffs by using post-spinoff data to (1) reconstruct the diversified firm after the spinoff and assess the aggregate improvement in value and (2) relate any value improvements to changes in diversity. We find that improvements in aggregate value depend significantly on changes in both a direct measure of diversity and measures based on industry proxies. We conclude that diversification discounts at least partially reflect a value loss due to the diversified nature of the firm itself, rather than selection bias or measurement error.","['Timothy R.

Discounting and underpricing in seasoned equity offers,"Expected discounting in seasoned equity offers is a cost of uncertainty about firm value, marketing new shares, and acquiring information that raises the offer price. Stockholders incorporate predictable discounting in stock prices when equity offers are first announced. The surprise component of discounting, reflecting the lead bank's final adjustment to the offer price, releases information that often causes economically large price swings on the offer day. Disparities between the issuer's closing price and the price suggested in the lead bank's final order book are a primary source of information. The discount surprise appears to be used by lead banks to update capital suppliers with that eleventh-hour information before they commit their funds.","['Oya Altınkılıç', 'Robert S Hansen']","['Underwriters', 'Seasoned public offerings', 'Investment banking', 'Underpricing']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001144,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,2
How much do firms hedge with derivatives?,"For 234 large non-financial corporations using derivatives, we report the magnitude of their risk exposure hedged by financial derivatives. If interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices change simultaneously by three standard deviations, the median firm's derivatives portfolio, at most, generates $15 million in cash and $31 million in value. These amounts are modest relative to firm size, and operating and investing cash flows, and other benchmarks. Corporate derivatives use appears to be a small piece of non-financial firms’ overall risk profile. This suggests a need to rethink past empirical research documenting the importance of firms’ derivative use.","['Wayne Guay', 'S.P Kothari']","['Derivatives', 'Hedging', 'Risk management', 'Financial instruments']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0300179X,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,70,3
CEO reputation and stock-based compensation,"I develop a theory of stock-based compensation contracts for the chief executive officers (CEOs) of firms and confront the theoretical predictions with recent CEO compensation data. The model characterizes the optimal contract for a CEO whose reputation evolves as signals of the executive's ability are observed by shareholders. Using various proxies for CEO reputation, I show a positive and economically meaningful relationship between stock-based pay-sensitivities and CEO reputation. The findings are robust to controls for CEO age, firm size, the dollar variability of the stock returns, and industry effects.",['Todd T.

Takeover bids and target directors’ incentives: the impact of a bid on directors’ wealth and board seats,"I investigate the nature of the incentives that lead outside directors to serve stockholders’ interests. Specifically, I document the effect of a takeover bid on target directors, both in terms of its immediate financial impact and its effect on the number of future board seats held by those target directors. Directors are rarely retained following a completed offer. All target directors hold fewer directorships in the future than a control group, suggesting that the target board seat is difficult to replace. For outside directors, the direct financial impact of a completed merger is predominately negative. This documents a cost to outside directors should they fail as monitors, forcing the external control market to act for them. Future seats are related to pre-bid performance. Among outside directors of poorly performing firms, those who rebuff an offer face partial settling-up in the directorial labor market, while those who complete the merger do not.",['Jarrad Harford'],"['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Board of directors', 'Director compensation', 'Board seats', 'Settling-up']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001089,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,1
Long-horizon regressions: theoretical results and applications,"I use asymptotic arguments to show that the t-statistics in long-horizon regressions do not converge to well-defined distributions. In some cases, moreover, the ordinary least squares estimator is not consistent and the R2 is an inadequate measure of the goodness of fit. These findings can partially explain the tendency of long-horizon regressions to find “significant” results where previous short-term approaches find none. I propose a rescaled t-statistic, whose asymptotic distribution is easy to simulate, and revisit some of the long-horizon evidence on return predictability and of the Fisher effect.",['Rossen Valkanov'],"['Predictive regressions', 'Long-horizon predictions', 'Stock returns', 'Fisher effect']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000655,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,2
Valuation effects of bank financing in acquisitions,"In a sample of 115 cash tender offers between 1990 and 1996, banks extend financing in 70% of the tender offers and finance the entire tender offer in half of these takeovers. Bank financing of tender offers is more likely when internal cash reserves are low. Acquisitions that are entirely financed by banks are associated with large and significantly positive acquirer announcement returns. Announcement returns are also positively related to the fraction of the acquisition value financed by bank debt. The benefits of bank financing are most important for both poorly performing acquirers and acquirers facing substantial informational asymmetries. Our results suggest that bank debt performs an important certification and monitoring role for acquirers in tender offers.","['Anu Bharadwaj', 'Anil Shivdasani']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Bank financing']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002337,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,67,1
Do equity financing cycles matter? evidence from biotechnology alliances,"In periods characterized by diminished public market financing, small biotechnology firms appear to be more likely to fund R&D through alliances with major corporations rather than with internal funds (raised through the capital markets). We consider 200 alliance agreements entered into by biotechnology firms between 1980 and 1995. Agreements signed during periods of limited external equity financing are more likely to assign the bulk of the control to the larger corporate partner, and are significantly less successful than other alliances. These agreements are also disproportionately likely to be renegotiated if financial market conditions subsequently improve.","['Josh Lerner', 'Hilary Shane', 'Alexander Tsai']","['Strategic alliances', 'Product market-financial market interactions', 'Initial public offerings', 'Venture capital']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002568,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,67,3
Why does IPO volume fluctuate so much?,"IPO volume fluctuates substantially over time. This paper compares the extent to which the aggregate capital demands of private firms, the adverse-selection costs of issuing equity, and the level of investor optimism can explain these fluctuations. Empirical tests include both aggregate and industry-level time-series regressions using proxies for the above factors and an analysis of the relation between post-IPO stock returns and IPO volume. Results indicate that firms’ demands for capital and investor sentiment are important determinants of IPO volume, in both statistical and economic terms. Adverse-selection costs are also statistically significant, but their economic effect appears small.",['Michelle Lowry'],"['IPO', 'Capital demands', 'Information asymmetry', 'Investor sentiment']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002301,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,67,1
Paper millionaires: how valuable is stock to a stockholder who is restricted from selling it?,Many firms have stockholders who face severe restrictions on their ability to sell their shares and diversify the risk of their personal wealth. We study the costs of these liquidity restrictions on stockholders using a continuous-time portfolio choice framework. These restrictions have major effects on the optimal investment and consumption strategies because of the need to hedge the illiquid stock position and smooth consumption in anticipation of the eventual lapse of the restrictions. These results provide a number of important insights about the effects of illiquidity in financial markets.,"['Matthias Kahl', 'Jun Liu', 'Francis A.

The economic value of volatility timing using “realized” volatility,"Recent work suggests that intradaily returns can be used to construct estimates of daily return volatility that are more precise than those constructed using daily returns. We measure the economic value of this “realized” volatility approach in the context of investment decisions. Our results indicate that the value of switching from daily to intradaily returns to estimate the conditional covariance matrix can be substantial. We estimate that a risk-averse investor would be willing to pay 50 to 200 basis points per year to capture the observed gains in portfolio performance. Moreover, these gains are robust to transaction costs, estimation risk regarding expected returns, and the performance measurement horizon.","['Jeff Fleming', 'Chris Kirby', 'Barbara Ostdiek']","['Volatility timing', 'Realized volatility', 'Portfolio optimization', 'Mean-variance analysis', 'Rolling estimators']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002593,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,67,3
Control benefits and CEO discipline in automatic bankruptcy auctions,"Swedish bankruptcy filing automatically terminates the employment of the chief executive officer (CEO) and triggers an auction of the firm. Critics of this system warn of excessive shareholder risk-shifting incentives prior to filing. We argue that private benefits of control induce managerial conservatism that may override shareholder risk-shifting incentives. By investing conservatively, the CEO increases the joint probability that the auction results in a going-concern sale and that the CEO is rehired. This uniquely implies that the rehiring probability is increasing in private control benefits, which our empirical results support. We also find that buyers in the auction screen on CEO quality. Overall, labor market discipline is dramatic, as filing CEOs suffer large income losses relative to CEOs of matched, non-bankrupt firms. Firms emerging from auction bankruptcy appear healthy as they typically go on to perform at par with industry rivals.","['B Espen Eckbo', 'Karin S Thorburn']","['Bankruptcy', 'Auctions', 'Liquidation', 'Restructuring', 'Risk shifting', 'Asset substitution', 'Managerial conservatism', 'Executive compensation', 'CEO turnover', 'Post-bankruptcy performance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001260,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,1
The maturity of debt issues and predictable variation in bond returns,"The maturity of new debt issues predicts excess bond returns. When the share of long-term debt issues in total debt issues is high, future excess bond returns are low. This predictive power comes in two parts. First, inflation, the real short-term rate, and the term spread predict excess bond returns. Second, these same variables explain the long-term share, and together account for much of its own ability to predict excess bond returns. The results are consistent with survey evidence that firms use debt market conditions in an effort to determine the lowest-cost maturity at which to borrow.","['Malcolm Baker', 'Robin Greenwood', 'Jeffrey Wurgler']","['Maturity structure', 'Term structure', 'Interest rates', 'Market efficiency']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001478,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,70,2
Cronyism and capital controls: evidence from Malaysia,"The onset of the Asian financial crisis in Malaysia reduced the expected value of government subsidies to politically connected firms, accounting for roughly 9% of the estimated $60 billion loss in their market value from July 1997 to August 1998. Firing the Deputy Prime Minister and imposing capital controls in September 1998 primarily benefited firms with strong ties to Prime Minister Mahathir, accounting for roughly 32% of these firms’ estimated $5 billion gain in market value during September 1998.

Termination fees in mergers and acquisitions,"The paper provides evidence on the effects of including a target termination fee in a merger contract. I test the implications of the hypothesis that termination fees are used by self-interested target managers to deter competing bids and protect “sweetheart” deals with white knight bidders, presumably resulting in lower premiums for target shareholders. An alternative hypothesis is that target managers use termination fees to encourage bidder participation by ensuring that the bidder is compensated for the revelation of valuable private information released during merger negotiations. My empirical evidence demonstrates that merger deals with target termination fees involve significantly higher premiums and success rates than deals without such clauses. Furthermore, only weak support is found for the contention that termination fees deter competing bids. Overall, the evidence suggests that termination fee use is at least not harmful, and is likely beneficial, to target shareholders.",['Micah S Officer'],"['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Takeovers', 'Termination fees', 'Takeover premiums']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001193,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,3
A closing call's impact on market quality at Euronext Paris,"The Paris Bourse (currently Euronext Paris) refined its trading system to include electronic call auctions at market closings in 1996 for its less-liquid Continuous B stocks and in 1998 for its more actively traded Continuous A stocks. This paper analyzes the effects of the innovation on market quality. Our empirical analysis of price behavior for two samples of firms (50 B stocks and 50 A stocks) for two different calendar dates (1996 and 1998) indicates that introduction of the closing calls has lowered execution costs for individual participants and sharpened price discovery for the broad market. We further observe that market quality is improved at market openings, albeit to a lesser extent. We suggest that a positive spillover effect explains the closing call's more pervasive impact.","['Michael S. Pagano', 'Robert A.

The great reversals: the politics of financial development in the twentieth century,"The state of development of the financial sector does not change monotonically over time. In particular, by most measures, countries were more financially developed in 1913 than in 1980 and only recently have they surpassed their 1913 levels. To explain these changes, we propose an interest group theory of financial development where incumbents oppose financial development because it breeds competition. The theory predicts that incumbents’ opposition will be weaker when an economy allows both cross-border trade and capital flows. This theory can go some way in accounting for the cross-country differences in, and the time-series variation of, financial development.","['Raghuram G Rajan', 'Luigi Zingales']","['Financial markets', 'Growth', 'Politics', 'Financial development', 'Reversals', 'Trade', 'Capital flows']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001259,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,1
Allocation of initial public offerings and flipping activity,"There is a general perception that the large trading volume in initial public offerings is mostly due to “flippers” that are allocated shares in the offering and immediately resell them. On average, however, flipping accounts for only 19% of trading volume and 15% of shares offered during the first two days of trading. Institutions do more flipping than retail customers and hot IPOs are flipped much more than cold IPOs.

How do family strategies affect fund performance? When performance-maximization is not the only game in town,"This is a first attempt to study how the structure of the industry affects mutual fund behavior. I show that industry structure matters; the mutual fund families employ strategies that rely on the heterogeneity of the investors in terms of investment horizon by offering the possibility to switch across different funds belonging to the same family at no cost.

The calendar structure of risk and expected returns on stocks and bonds,"This paper documents, for 1947–2000, seasonalities in economic activity, stock and bond returns, and relationships among them. Evidence is consistent with an annual cycle view of economic activity and risk conditions. The power of lagged stock returns to forecast economic activity is greater for quarters ending in December and March. Mean excess returns on NYSE stocks in October through March account for 78–107% of their annual means and reflect a seasonal asymmetric return reversal tendency, which in turn explains low long-horizon variance ratios. Both market losses in April through September and subsequent returns in October through March are related, but with opposing signs, to October through March economic activity. The forecasting power of five variables is greatest for October through March. Tests of an asset-pricing model indicate that expected returns vary both cross-sectionally and over time.

Earnings management and investor protection: an international comparison,"This paper examines systematic differences in earnings management across 31 countries. We propose an explanation for these differences based on the notion that insiders, in an attempt to protect their private control benefits, use earnings management to conceal firm performance from outsiders. Thus, earnings management is expected to decrease in investor protection because strong protection limits insiders’ ability to acquire private control benefits, which reduces their incentives to mask firm performance. Our findings are consistent with this prediction and suggest an endogenous link between corporate governance and the quality of reported earnings.","['Christian Leuz', 'Dhananjay Nanda', 'Peter D Wysocki']","['Corporate governance', 'Earnings management', 'Investor protection', 'Law', 'Private control benefits']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001211,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,3

The marketing role of IPOs: evidence from internet stocks,"This paper explores the potential marketing benefits of going public and of IPO underpricing. We examine the impact of IPO underpricing on website traffic, which is a direct measure of product market performance for internet firms. If underpricing attracts media attention and creates valuable publicity, we expect an increase in web traffic following the IPO. We find that web traffic growth in the month after the IPO is positively and significantly associated with initial returns, and the effect is economically significant. We also investigate media reaction to initial returns for a broader sample of IPOs. The results suggest that the marketing benefits of underpricing extend beyond the internet sector and the “hot issues” market of the late 1990s.","['Elizabeth Demers', 'Katharina Lewellen']","['IPO', 'Underpricing', 'Marketing', 'Internet', 'Web traffic']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000722,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,3
"Executive rank, pay and project selection","This paper extends the literature on executive compensation by developing and testing a principal-agent model in the context of project selection. The model's focus on executive project selection decisions highlights the multidimensional nature of executive choices that affect the value of the firm. An executive not only makes an effort choice that determines the quality of information on which to base a decision but also sets the decision criteria for selecting projects. A project selection framework is also shown to introduce endogenous uncertainty into compensation that can influence the executive's effort choice. Using an extensive data set, our empirical work supports the main hypotheses of the model, including the significance of executive rank in determining the extent of use of incentive pay in general and equity-based incentive pay in particular.","['John M.

It finds that ordinary inventories best explain dealer firms’ quote placement strategy, which dealer firm executes trades, and the quality of execution offered to the trades. This finding is consistent with decentralized nature of market-making where individual dealers focus on the position risk of stocks managed by them and not the position risks of stocks managed by other dealers in the firm.","['Narayan Y.

The value of corporate voting rights and control: A cross-country analysis,"This paper measures the value of corporate voting rights, specifically of the control block of votes, in a sample of 661 dual-class firms in 18 countries, in 1997. A consistent measure across countries is proposed. The measure is adjusted for takeover probability, block-holding costs, and dividend and liquidity differences between the share classes. The value of controlblock votes varies widely across countries. It is close to half of firm market value in South Korea, and close to zero in Finland. The value of control-block votes is interpreted as a lower bound for actual private benefits of the controlling shareholder. The legal environment, law enforcement, investor protection, takeover regulations, and power-concentrating corporate charter provisions explain 68% of the cross-country variation in the value of control-block votes.",['Tatiana Nenova'],"['Corporate control', 'Voting premium', 'Dual-class firms', 'Takeover laws', 'Investor protection']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000692,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,3
A barrier option framework for corporate security valuation,"This paper proposes a framework for corporate security valuation based on path-dependent, barrier option models instead of the commonly used path-independent approach. We argue that path dependency is an intrinsic and fundamental characteristic of corporate securities because equity can be knocked out whenever a legally binding barrier is breached. A direct implication of this framework is that equity will be priced as a down-and-out call option. We provide empirical validation of the barrier model by showing that implied barriers are statistically and economically significant for a large cross-section of industrial firms. Additional robustness tests confirm that barriers remain significant over a wide range of input variable estimates. And finally, we apply the barrier option framework to bankruptcy prediction and find that implied failure probabilities dominate Z-scores in most cases.","['Paul Brockman', 'H.J.

Universal option valuation using quadrature methods,"This paper proposes and develops a novel, simple, widely applicable numerical approach for option pricing based on quadrature methods. Though in some ways similar to lattice or finite-difference schemes, it possesses exceptional accuracy and speed. Discretely monitored options are valued with only one timestep between observations, and nodes can be perfectly placed in relation to discontinuities. Convergence is improved greatly; in the extrapolated scheme, a doubling of points can reduce error by a factor of 256. Complex problems (e.g., fixed-strike lookback discrete barrier options) can be evaluated accurately and orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods.","['Ari D.

Capital structure and product markets interactions: evidence from business cycles,"This paper provides firm- and industry-level evidence of the effects of capital structure on product market outcomes for a large cross-section of industries over a number of years. The analysis uses shocks to aggregate demand as surrogates for exogenous changes in the product market environment. I find that debt financing has a negative impact on firm (relative-to-industry) sales growth in industries in which rivals are relatively unlevered during recessions, but not during booms. In contrast, no such effects are observed for firms competing in high-debt industries. At the industry level, markups are more countercyclical when industry debt is high. The cyclical dynamics I find for firm sales growth and for industry markups are consistent with Chevalier and Scharfstein's (American Economic Review (1996)) prediction that firms which rely heavily on external financing are more likely to cut their investment in market share building in response to negative shocks to demand and that the competitive outcomes resulting from such actions depend on the financial structures of their industry rivals.",['Murillo Campello'],"['Product markets', 'Capital structure', 'Business cycles', 'Industry rivalry', 'Markups']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000709,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,3
Capital structure choice: macroeconomic conditions and financial constraints,"This paper provides new evidence of how macroeconomic conditions affect capital structure choice. We model firms’ target capital structures as a function of macroeconomic conditions and firm-specific variables. We split our sample based on a measure of financial constraints. Target leverage is counter-cyclical for the relatively unconstrained sample, but pro-cyclical for the relatively constrained sample. Macroeconomic conditions are significant for issue choice for unconstrained firms but less so for constrained firms. Our results support the hypothesis that unconstrained firms time their issue choice to coincide with periods of favorable macroeconomic conditions, while constrained firms do not.","['Robert A Korajczyk', 'Amnon Levy']","['Capital structure', 'Business cycles', 'Financial constraints']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002490,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,1
Arbitrage risk and the book-to-market anomaly,"This paper shows that the book-to-market (B/M) effect is greater for stocks with higher idiosyncratic return volatility, higher transaction costs, and lower investor sophistication, consistent with the market-mispricing explanation for the anomaly. The B/M effect for high volatility stocks exceeds that for the low volatility stocks in 20 of the 22 sample years. Also, volatility exhibits significant incremental power beyond transaction costs and investor sophistication measures in explaining cross-sectional variation in the B/M effect. These findings are consistent with the Shleifer and Vishny (1997) thesis that risk associated with the volatility of arbitrage returns deters arbitrage activity and is an important reason why the B/M effect exists.","['Ashiq Ali', 'Lee-Seok Hwang', 'Mark A.

Corporate governance and firm profitability: evidence from Korea before the economic crisis,"This study examines how ownership structure and conflicts of interest among shareholders under a poor corporate governance system affected firm performance before the crisis. Using 5,829 Korean firms subject to outside auditing during 1993–1997, the paper finds that firms with low ownership concentration show low firm profitability, controlling for firm and industry characteristics. Controlling shareholders expropriated firm resources even when their ownership concentration was small. Firms with a high disparity between control rights and ownership rights showed low profitability. When a business group transferred resources from a subsidiary to another, they were often wasted, suggesting that “tunneling” occurred. In addition, the negative effects of control-ownership disparity and internal capital market inefficiency were stronger in publicly traded firms than in privately held ones.",['Sung Wook Joh'],"['Corporate governance', 'Ownership', 'Profitability', 'Shareholder expropriation', 'Business group']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000680,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,2
Quote-based competition and trade execution costs in NYSE-listed stocks,"This study examines quotations, order routing, and trade execution costs for seven markets that compete for orders in large-capitalization NYSE-listed stocks. The competitiveness of quote updates from each market varies with measures of the profitability of attracting additional order and with volatility and inventory measures. The probability of a trade executing on each market increases when the market posts competitive quotes. Execution costs for non-NYSE trades when the local market posts competitive (non-competitive) quotes are virtually the same (substantially exceed) costs for matched NYSE trades. Collectively, these results imply a significant degree of quote-based competition for order flow and are consistent with off-NYSE liquidity providers using competitive quotations to signal when they are prepared to give better-than-normal trade executions.",['Hendrik Bessembinder'],"['Competition for order flow', 'Quotation strategies', 'Trading costs']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001685,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,70,3
Stock price reaction to news and no-news: drift and reversal after headlines,"Using a comprehensive database of headlines about individual companies, I examine monthly returns following public news. I compare them to stocks with similar returns, but no identifiable public news. There is a difference between the two sets. I find strong drift after bad news. Investors seem to react slowly to this information. I also find reversal after extreme price movements unaccompanied by public news. The separate patterns appear even after adjustments for risk exposure and other effects. They are, however, mainly seen in smaller, more illiquid stocks. These findings support some integrated theories of investor over- and underreaction.",['Wesley S.

"The choice among bank debt, non-bank private debt, and public debt: evidence from new corporate borrowings","Using a sample of 1,560 new debt financings, we examine the choice among bank debt, non-bank private debt, and public debt. The primary determinant of the debt source is the credit quality of the issuer. Firms with the highest credit quality borrow from public sources, firms with medium credit quality borrow from banks, and firms with the lowest credit quality borrow from non-bank private lenders. Non-bank private debt thus plays a unique role in accommodating the financing needs of firms with low credit quality. In addition, the choice of debt source is (weakly) influenced by managerial discretion.","['David J Denis', 'Vassil T Mihov']","['Banks', 'Private debt', 'Public debt', 'Debt policy']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001405,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,70,1
"Law, endowments, and finance","Using a sample of 70 former colonies, this paper assesses two theories regarding the historical determinants of financial development. The law and finance theory holds that legal traditions, brought by colonizers, differ in terms of protecting the rights of private investors vis-à-vis the state, with important implications for financial markets. The endowment theory argues that the disease environment encountered by colonizers influences the formation of long-lasting institutions that shape financial development. The empirical results provide evidence for both theories. However, initial endowments explain more of the cross-country variation in financial intermediary and stock market development.","['Thorsten Beck', 'Asli Demirgüç-Kunt', 'Ross Levine']","['Law', 'Endowments', 'Financial development', 'Economic development', 'Property rights']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001442,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,70,2
An examination of own account trading by dual traders in futures markets,"Using proprietary audit trail transaction data compiled by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we investigate at the individual trader level (1) the timing and (2) the determinants of dual traders’ personal trades. Our analysis reveals an absence of any trade timing by dual traders in relation to the execution of their customers’ orders. Further examination employing correlation statistics and time series regressions provides strong support for the proposition that dual traders supply liquidity and actively manage inventory. Even after simultaneously controlling for factors representing information, liquidity supply, and inventory control, within a multivariate regression framework, liquidity supply and inventory control remain as the determinants of dual traders’ personal trades. Overall, the emergent profile of a dual trader is that of an uninformed trader performing complimentary tasks.","['Sugato Chakravarty', 'Kai Li']","['Dual trading', 'Front-running', 'Informed trader', 'Inventory', 'Liquidity', 'G20', 'G28', 'Dual trading', 'Front-running', 'Informed trader', 'Inventory', 'Liquidity']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0300117X,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,2
Institutional trading and alternative trading systems,"We analyze the use of alternative trading systems in a large sample of institutional orders and the trades that constitute these orders. Proprietary data allow us to distinguish between orders and trades filled by day and after-hours crossing systems, electronic communication networks (ECNs), and traditional brokers. Controlling for variation in order and security characteristics, as well as endogeneity in the choice of trading venue, we find that realized execution costs are generally lower on alternative trading systems. Order handling rules and tick size changes implemented in 1997 appear to have reduced the cost advantage of trading on ECNs.","['Jennifer Conrad', 'Kevin M.

Governance and boards of directors in closed-end investment companies,"We analyze whether board structure and director independence in closed-end investment companies are related to shareholder interests in ways that are consistent with boards being effective monitors. We report that funds with relatively low expense ratios, one measure of board effectiveness, have smaller boards, a higher proportion of board members who are legally considered independent, relatively low director compensation, and charter provisions that specify remedial action if discounts become large. Evidence from our analysis of major fund restructuring decisions, including share repurchases, open-ending proposals and right offerings, is largely consistent with the expense ratio analysis. Overall, board characteristics that we identify with effective board independence are associated with lower expense ratios and value-enhancing restructurings.","['Diane Del Guercio', 'Larry Y Dann', 'M.Megan Partch']","['Closed-end funds', 'Boards of directors', 'Corporate governance', 'Open-endings', 'Repurchases', 'Rights offerings']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001107,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,1
Payment for order flow,"We develop a dynamic model of price competition in broker and dealer markets. With no payment for order flow, a zero-profit equilibrium exists. With payment for order flow, spreads widen to more than compensate for this payment; hence, there is no equilibrium in which market makers earn zero profits. While brokerage commissions for market orders can fall, the total transactions cost to submitting a market order remains positive. Consumer and social welfare are both lower in any equilibrium with payment for order flow; payment for order flow redistributes payoffs from traders who demand liquidity to those who supply it.","['Christine A.

A multivariate model of strategic asset allocation,We develop an approximate solution method for the optimal consumption and portfolio choice problem of an infinitely long-lived investor with Epstein–Zin utility who faces a set of asset returns described by a vector autoregression in returns and state variables. Empirical estimates in long-run annual and post-war quarterly U.S. data suggest that the predictability of stock returns greatly increases the optimal demand for stocks. The role of nominal bonds in long-term portfolios depends on the importance of real interest rate risk relative to other sources of risk. Long-term inflation-indexed bonds greatly increase the utility of conservative investors.,"['John Y. Campbell', 'Yeung Lewis Chan', 'Luis M.

China share issue privatization: the extent of its success,"We evaluate the performance changes of 634 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) listed on China's two exchanges upon share issuing privatisation (SIP) in the period 1994–1998. We find that SIP is effective in improving SOEs’ earnings ability, real sales, and workers’ productivity but is not successful in improving profit returns and leverage after privatisation. We also find state ownership having negative impacts on firm performance and legal-person ownership having positive impacts on firm performance after SIP, which suggests that legal persons behave differently from the state government. Surprisingly, foreign ownership does not show uniformly strong, positive impacts on firm performance.","['Qian Sun', 'Wilson H.S Tong']","['China', 'Partial privatization', 'State-owned enterprise', 'Performance change', 'Restructuring']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001454,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,70,2
"Executive stock option repricing, internal governance mechanisms, and management turnover","We examine firms that reprice their executive stock options and find little evidence that repricing reflects managerial entrenchment or ineffective governance. Repricing grants are economically significant, but there is little else unusual about compensation in repricing firms. Repricers tend to be smaller, younger, rapidly growing firms that experience a deep, sudden shock to growth and profitability. They are also more concentrated in the technology, trade, and service sectors and have smaller boards of directors. Repricers have abnormally high CEO turnover rates, which is inconsistent with the entrenchment hypothesis. Over 40% of repricers exclude the CEO's options when they reprice.","['N.K.

Breaking up is hard to do? An analysis of termination fee provisions and merger outcomes,"We examine the provision of termination fee clauses in merger agreements between 1989 and 1998. Target-payable fees are observed more frequently when bidding is costly and the potential for information expropriation by third parties is significant. Fee provisions appear to benefit target shareholders through higher deal completion rates and greater negotiated takeover premiums. We conclude that target-payable fees serve as an efficient contracting device, rather than a means by which to deter competitive bidding. Bidder fee provisions appear to be used to secure target wealth gains in deals with higher costs associated with negotiation and bid failure.","['Thomas W. Bates', 'Michael L.

"Allocations, adverse selection, and cascades in IPOs: Evidence from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange","We examine theories of IPO underpricing using unique data from Israel where the allocation to subscribers is by equal proration. This enables us to simulate the return earned by uninformed investors. Consistent with Rock's (1986) theory of adverse selection, allocations were negatively related to underpricing. But uninformed investors earned a negative allocation-weighted initial return, although the average initial return was 12%. They could break even, however, by using publicly available information. The data also supports Welch's (1992) theory of information cascades: demand is either extremely high or there is undersubscription, with very few cases in between.","['Yakov Amihud', 'Shmuel Hauser', 'Amir Kirsh']","['IPO', 'Underpricing', 'Uninformed subscribers', 'Proration']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002519,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,1
Control as a motivation for underpricing: a comparison of dual and single-class IPOs,"We find that dual-class firms experience less underpricing than single-class firms and explore several hypotheses which explain this phenomenon. Compared to single-class firms, dual-class companies have slightly higher post-IPO institutional ownership and experience fewer control events. Although dual-class firms achieve a lower underpricing cost, they trade at lower prices relative to earnings and sales than single-class IPOs. This pricing differential, combined with evidence that dual-class managers earn higher compensation and that dual-class shares are common among media and entertainment industry IPOs, suggests that dual-class ownership structures protect private control benefits.","['Scott B Smart', 'Chad J Zutter']","['Initial public offerings (IPO)', 'Underpricing', 'Dual class', 'Ownership structure', 'Governance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001090,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,1
Founding family ownership and the agency cost of debt,"We investigate the impact of founding family ownership structure on the agency cost of debt. We find that founding family ownership is common in large, publicly traded firms and is related, both statistically and economically, to a lower cost of debt financing. Our results are consistent with the idea that founding family firms have incentive structures that result in fewer agency conflicts between equity and debt claimants. This suggests that bond holders view founding family ownership as an organizational structure that better protects their interests.","['Ronald C. Anderson', 'Sattar A. Mansi', 'David M.

Voting with their feet: institutional ownership changes around forced CEO turnover,"We investigate whether institutional investors “vote with their feet” when dissatisfied with a firm's management by examining changes in equity ownership around forced CEO turnover. We find that aggregate institutional ownership and the number of institutional investors decline in the year prior to forced CEO turnover. However, selling by institutions is far from universal. Overall, there is an increase in shareholdings of individual investors and a decrease in holdings of institutional investors who are more concerned with holding prudent securities, are better informed, or are engaged in momentum trading. Measures of institutional ownership changes are negatively related to the likelihoods of forced CEO turnover and that an executive from outside the firm is appointed CEO.","['Robert Parrino', 'Richard W Sias', 'Laura T Starks']","['Corporate governance', 'Institutional investors', 'CEO turnover']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002477,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,1
Stock market driven acquisitions,"We present a model of mergers and acquisitions based on stock market misvaluations of the combining firms. The key ingredients of the model are the relative valuations of the merging firms and the market's perception of the synergies from the combination.

Concealing and confounding adverse signals: insider wealth-maximizing behavior in the IPO process,"We study a known negative signal, the sale of insider shares in an IPO and find that insiders adopt two concealment strategies consistent with wealth-maximizing behavior. First, insiders underreport the number of personally owned shares in the prominent original prospectus and use an obscure amendment to communicate the true higher level of shares to be offered. Second, when insiders increase shares in a later amendment, they tend to either increase secondary shares disproportional to primary share increases, or to reduce primary shares to wholly or partly conceal the increase in secondary shares offered. Insiders confound the negative secondary share signal by simultaneously sending a positive lockup signal.","['James S. Ang', 'James C.

Style investing,"We study asset prices in an economy where some investors categorize risky assets into different styles and move funds among these styles depending on their relative performance. In our economy, assets in the same style comove too much, assets in different styles comove too little, and reclassifying an asset into a new style raises its correlation with that style. We also predict that style returns exhibit a rich pattern of own- and cross-autocorrelations and that while asset-level momentum and value strategies are profitable, their style-level counterparts are even more so. We use the model to shed light on several style-related empirical anomalies.","['Nicholas Barberis', 'Andrei Shleifer']","['Style investing', 'Comovement', 'Positive feedback', 'Value', 'Momentum']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03000643,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,68,2
Dynamic derivative strategies,"We study optimal investment strategies given investor access not only to bond and stock markets but also to the derivatives market. The problem is solved in closed form. Derivatives extend the risk and return tradeoffs associated with stochastic volatility and price jumps. As a means of exposure to volatility risk, derivatives enable non-myopic investors to exploit the time-varying opportunity set; and as a means of exposure to jump risk, they enable investors to disentangle the simultaneous exposure to diffusive and jump risks in the stock market. Calibrating to the S&P 500 index and options markets, we find sizable portfolio improvement from derivatives investing.","['Jun Liu', 'Jun Pan']","['Asset allocation', 'Portfolio selection', 'Derivatives', 'Stochastic volatility', 'Jumps']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001181,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,69,3
Testing the pecking order theory of capital structure,"We test the pecking order theory of corporate leverage on a broad cross-section of publicly traded American firms for 1971 to 1998. Contrary to the pecking order theory, net equity issues track the financing deficit more closely than do net debt issues. While large firms exhibit some aspects of pecking order behavior, the evidence is not robust to the inclusion of conventional leverage factors, nor to the analysis of evidence from the 1990s. Financing deficit is less important in explaining net debt issues over time for firms of all sizes.","['Murray Z Frank', 'Vidhan K Goyal']","['Pecking order theory', 'Capital structure', 'Financing deficit']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X02002520,Journal of Financial Economics,2003,67,2
Firms and their distressed banks: lessons from the Norwegian banking crisis,"We use the near-collapse of the Norwegian banking system during the period 1988–1991 to measure the impact of bank distress announcements on the stock prices of firms maintaining a relationship with a distressed bank. Although banks experienced large and permanent downward revisions in their equity value during the event period, firms maintaining relationships with these banks faced only small and temporary changes, on average, in stock price. Firms with access to unused liquid bank funds and firms that issued equity just prior to the crisis experience relatively high abnormal returns.

The personal-tax advantages of equity,"We value a firm that pays its cash flows to equity through share repurchases in a dynamic environment where personal taxes are paid on capital gains upon realization. The cost of capital is reduced by approximately 0.8% through the use of repurchases relative to dividends. We use the empirical distribution of pre-tax free cash flows in Fama and French (1999) to evaluate the tradeoffs between the costs of financial distress, the personal-tax advantages of equity, and the corporate-tax advantage to debt.
