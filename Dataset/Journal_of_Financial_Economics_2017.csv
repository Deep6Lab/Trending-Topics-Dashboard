Offshore activities and financial vs operational hedging,"A key question is why many multinational firms forgo foreign exchange derivative (FX) hedging and instead use operational hedging. We propose an explanation based on illiquidity and the unique advantages of operational hedges. We use 10-K filings to construct dynamically updated text-based measures of the offshore sale of output, purchase of input, and ownership of assets. We find that firms use FX derivatives when they are liquid and generally available. Otherwise, they often favor purchasing input from the same nations they sell output to, an operational hedge. Quasi-natural experiments based on new derivative product launches suggest a likely causal relation.","['Gerard Hoberg', 'S.

An extrapolative model of house price dynamics,"A model in which homebuyers make a modest approximation leads house prices to display three features present in the data but usually missing from rational models: momentum at one-year horizons, mean reversion at five-year horizons, and excess longer-term volatility relative to fundamentals. Approximating buyers assume that past prices reflect only contemporaneous demand, just like professional economists who use trends in housing prices to infer trends in housing demand. Consistent with survey evidence, this approximation leads buyers to expect increases in the market value of their homes after recent house price increases.","['Edward L. Glaeser', 'Charles G.

International tests of a five-factor asset pricing model,"Average stock returns for North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific increase with the book-to-market ratio (B/M) and profitability and are negatively related to investment. For Japan, the relation between average returns and B/M is strong, but average returns show little relation to profitability or investment. A five-factor model that adds profitability and investment factors to the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993) largely absorbs the patterns in average returns. As in Fama and French, 2015, Fama and French, 2016, the model's prime problem is failure to capture fully the low average returns of small stocks whose returns behave like those of low profitability firms that invest aggressively.","['Eugene F.

The price of variance risk,"Between 1996 and 2014, it was costless on average to hedge news about future variance at horizons ranging from 1 quarter to 14 years. Only unexpected, transitory realized variance was significantly priced. These results present a challenge to many structural models of the variance risk premium, such as the intertemporal CAPM and recent models with Epstein–Zin preferences and long-run risks. The results are also difficult to reconcile with macro models in which volatility affects investment decisions. At the same time, the data allows us to distinguish between different disaster models; a model in which the stock market has a time-varying exposure to disasters and investors have power utility fits the major features of the variance term structure.","['Ian Dew-Becker', 'Stefano Giglio', 'Anh Le', 'Marius Rodriguez']","['Variance risk premium', 'Recursive preferences', 'Disasters']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302161,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,2
"Capital utilization, market power, and the pricing of investment shocks","Capital utilization and market power crucially affect asset prices in an economy exposed to shocks that improve real investment opportunities through capital-embodied technological innovations. We embed these two mechanisms in a standard general equilibrium model and show that (i) the price of risk for investment shocks is negative under fixed capital utilization, but positive under sufficiently flexible capital utilization, and (ii) the equity return exposure to investment shocks is negative under perfect competition, but positive under high market power. We further show that, high market power, persistent components in technology growth, and a strong preference for early resolution of uncertainty are jointly important to quantitatively match the observed equity risk premium.","['Lorenzo Garlappi', 'Zhongzhi Song']","['Investment shocks', 'Capital utilization', 'Market power', 'Risk premium']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302313,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,3

The impact of portfolio disclosure on hedge fund performance,"Consistent with the argument that portfolio disclosure reveals trade secrets, a difference-in-differences estimation suggests a drop in fund performance after a hedge fund begins filing Form 13F as well as an increase in return correlations with other funds in the same investment style. The drop in performance is concentrated among funds with larger expected proprietary costs of disclosure, for instance, funds that disclose a greater fraction of their assets or hold more illiquid stocks. The drop in performance cannot be fully explained by alternative explanations such as decreasing returns to scale or mean reversion in fund returns.",['Zhen Shi'],"['Mandatory portfolio disclosure', 'Hedge fund performance', 'Proprietary cost']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301186,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,1
"Shaped by their daughters: Executives, female socialization, and corporate social responsibility","Corporate executives managing some of the largest public companies in the U.S. are shaped by their daughters. When a firm’s chief executive officer (CEO) has a daughter, the corporate social responsibility rating (CSR) is about 9.1% higher, compared to a median firm. The results are robust to confronting several sources of endogeneity, e.g., examining first-born CEO daughters and CEO changes. The relation is strongest for diversity, but significant also for broader pro-social practices related to the environment and employee relations. Our study contributes to research on female socialization, heterogeneity in CSR policies, and plausibly exogenous determinants of CEOs’ styles.","['Henrik Cronqvist', 'Frank Yu']","['CEOs', 'Family environment', 'Female socialization', 'Corporate social responsibility']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302350,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,3
Are corporate inversions good for shareholders?,"Corporate inversion, the process of redomiciling for tax purposes, reduces corporate income taxes, but it imposes a personal tax cost that is shareholder-specific. We develop a model, incorporating the corporate tax benefits and personal tax costs, to quantify the return to inversion for different shareholders. Foreign and tax-exempt investors, along with the chief executive officer, disproportionately benefit. We show that an inversion simultaneously reduces the wealth of many taxable shareholders. The model illustrates an agency conflict in which heterogeneity in personal taxes generates a wealth transfer between shareholders. Furthermore, personal taxes offset the loss in government revenue by 39%.","['Anton Babkin', 'Brent Glover', 'Oliver Levine']","['Corporate governance', 'Fiduciary duty', 'Shareholder conflicts', 'Tax-clientele effects', 'Mergers and acquisitions']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301514,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,2
Why do loans contain covenants? Evidence from lending relationships,"Despite the importance of banks’ role as delegated monitors, little is known about how non-price terms of loan contracts are structured to optimize information production in a lending relationship. Using a large sample of corporate loans, this paper examines the effect of relationship lending on covenant choice. Consistent with information asymmetry theories, covenant tightness is relaxed over the duration of a relationship, especially for opaque borrowers. In contrast, the effect of lending relationship intensity on the number of covenants included in a loan follows an inverted U shape. I discuss potential explanations for this finding.",['Robert Prilmeier'],"['Relationships', 'Banking', 'Covenants', 'Information asymmetries', 'Monitoring incentives']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302379,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,3
The bright side of financial derivatives: Options trading and firm innovation,"Do financial derivatives enhance or impede innovation? We answer this question by examining the relationship between equity options markets and standard measures of firm innovation. We find that firms with more options trading activity generate more patents and patent citations per dollar invested in research and development (R&D), after accounting for other confounding factors. These results are confirmed when we use a propensity score matching procedure and an instrumental variable approach to control for the potential endogeneity of options trading. The evidence is consistent with the notion that the enhanced informational efficiency induced by options leads to an improved allocation of corporate resources. We further discuss possible underlying economic mechanisms through which more active options markets boost innovation and show that the effect remains substantial even after controlling for these mechanisms. Considering the average increase in the dollar volume of options traded for our sample firms, we conclude that a 200% move in options volume increases firm innovation by about 31%.","['Iván Blanco', 'David Wehrheim']","['Innovation', 'R&D productivity', 'Options market', 'Price informativeness', 'Career concerns']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300739,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,1
Who is internationally diversified? Evidence from the 401(k) plans of 296 firms,"Drawing on a novel database of the 401(k) plans of 296 firms, we examine the international equity allocations of 3.8 million individuals over the 2005–2011 period. We find enormous cross-individual variation, ranging from zero to more than 75%, and strong cohort effects, with younger cohorts investing more internationally than older ones and each cohort investing more internationally over time. Access to financial advice, lower fees, and more international fund choices are associated with higher international allocations, suggesting a role for plan design and policy. Education, financial literacy, and the fraction of foreign-born population in the ZIP code also have positive effects on international diversification, consistent with explanations based on familiarity bias and information barriers.","['Geert Bekaert', 'Kenton Hoyem', 'Wei-Yin Hu', 'Enrichetta Ravina']","['International diversification', 'Micro data', '401(k) portfolios']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302483,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,1
Early peek advantage? Efficient price discovery with tiered information disclosure,"From 2007 to June 2013, a small group of fee-paying, high-speed traders receive the Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment two seconds before its broader release. Within this early peek window, we find highly concentrated trading and a fast price discovery of less than 200 milliseconds. Outside this narrow window, general investors trade at fully adjusted prices. We further establish a causal relationship between the early peek mechanism and the fast price discovery by isolating the impact of the early peek arrangement along two dimensions. In cross section, we use other news releases without the early peek (as controls); in time series, we use the sudden suspension of the early peek arrangement in July 2013 (as the treatment). Our difference-in-difference tests directly connect the early peek arrangement to more efficient price discovery — it results in faster price discovery, lower volatility, and faster resolution of uncertainty. These results show that contrary to the common perception, tiered information release may help to reduce, rather than enhance, the informational advantage of faster traders and improve the efficiency of the price discovery process in financial markets.","['Grace Xing Hu', 'Jun Pan', 'Jiang Wang']","['Early peek', 'Information disclosure', 'Price discovery', 'High frequency trading']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730154X,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,2
Interim fund performance and fundraising in private equity,"General partners (GPs) in private equity (PE) report the performance of an existing fund while raising capital for a follow-on fund. Interim performance has large effects on fundraising outcomes. The impact is greatest when backed by exits and for low reputation GPs. Faced with these incentives, GPs time their fundraising to coincide with periods of peak performance through two strategies: (1) exit and fundraise and (2) net asset value (NAV) management. Consistent with the former, performance peaks are greatest for funds with high realization rates. Consistent with the latter, low reputation GPs with low realization rates experience performance peaks and erosions in performance after fundraising.","['Brad M.

Well-connected short-sellers pay lower loan fees: A market-wide analysis,"High loan fees generate short-selling constraints and, therefore, reduce price efficiency. Despite the importance of loan fees, empirical evidence on their determinants is scarce. Using a market-wide deal-by-deal data set on the Brazilian equity lending market which uniquely identifies borrowers, brokers, and lenders, we are able to construct a proxy of search costs at the borrower–stock–day level. We find that—for the same stock, on the same day—borrowers with higher search costs pay significantly higher loan fees. Our results suggest that regulators should encourage the use of a centralized lending platform to reduce search costs in the lending market.","['Fernando Chague', 'Rodrigo De-Losso', 'Alan De Genaro', 'Bruno Giovannetti']","['Loan fees', 'Short-selling restrictions', 'Search costs', 'Equity lending market', 'Opaque markets']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302495,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,3
Acquiring growth,"I develop a model of mergers in which M&A deals are used to reallocate investment opportunities. In equilibrium, acquirers lack internal growth options and seek out projects from targets in the M&A market. The model is able to reconcile many features of the merger data that I document, including the high productivity, investment, and valuation of target firms. Furthermore, in my model, profitability is highly predictive of acquisition, and merger transactions naturally lead to a substantial drop in profitability despite creating value for the acquirer.",['Oliver Levine'],"['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Growth options', 'Intangible capital', 'Corporate investment']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301484,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,2
Political uncertainty and investment: Causal evidence from U.S. gubernatorial elections,"I examine the link between political uncertainty and firm investment using U.S. gubernatorial elections as a source of plausibly exogenous variation in uncertainty. Investment declines 5% before all elections and up to 15% for subsamples of firms particularly susceptible to political uncertainty. I use term limits as an instrumental variable (IV) for election closeness. Because close elections are related to economic downturns, I find that the effect of close elections on investment is understated by more than half by ordinary least squares (OLS). Post-election rebounds in investment depend on whether an incumbent is re-elected. Finally, I provide evidence that firms delay equity and debt issuances tied to investments before elections.",['Candace E.

"Confidence, bond risks, and equity returns","I show that investor confidence (size of ambiguity) about future consumption growth is driven by past consumption growth and inflation. The impact of inflation on confidence has moved considerably over time and switched on average from negative to positive in 1997. Motivated by this evidence, I develop and estimate a model in which the confidence process has discrete regime shifts, and I find that the time-varying impact of inflation on confidence enables the model to match bond risks over different subperiods. The model can also account for stock and bond return predictability, and correlation between price-dividend ratios and inflation, among other features of the data.",['Guihai Zhao'],"['Bond returns', 'Equity returns', 'Correlation', 'Ambiguity', 'Regime switch']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302398,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,3
Financial dependence and innovation: The case of public versus private firms,"In this paper, we examine the relation between innovation and a firm’s financial dependence using a sample of privately held and publicly traded US firms. We find that public firms in external finance dependent industries spend more on research and development and generate a better patent portfolio than their private counterparts. However, public firms in internal finance dependent industries do not have a better innovation profile than private firms. The results are robust to various empirical strategies that address selection bias. The findings indicate that the influence of public listing on innovation depends on the need for external capital.","['Viral Acharya', 'Zhaoxia Xu']","['Private firms', 'Public firms', 'Innovation', 'R&D', 'Financial dependence']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16300101,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,2
Designated market makers still matter: Evidence from two natural experiments,"Independent technological glitches forced two separate trading halts on different U.S. exchanges during the week of July 6, 2015. During each halt, all other exchanges remained open. We exploit exogenous variation provided by this unprecedented coincidence, in conjunction with a proprietary data set, to identify the causal impact of Designated Market Maker (DMM) participation on liquidity. When the voluntary liquidity providers on one exchange were removed, liquidity remained unchanged; when DMMs were removed, liquidity decreased market-wide. We find evidence consistent with the idea that these DMMs, despite facing only mild formal obligations, significantly improve liquidity in the modern electronic marketplace.","['Adam D.

Systematic mistakes in the mortgage market and lack of financial sophistication,"Institutions often offer a menu of contracts to consumers in an attempt to create a separating equilibrium that reveals borrower types and provides better pricing. We test the effectiveness of a specific set of contracts in the mortgage market: mortgage points. Points allow borrowers to exchange an upfront amount for a decrease in the mortgage rate. We document that, on average, points takers lose about $700. Also, points takers are less financially savvy (less educated, older), and they make mistakes on other dimensions (e.g., inefficiently refinancing their mortgages). Overall, our results show that borrowers overestimate how long they will stay with the mortgage.","['Sumit Agarwal', 'Itzhak Ben-David', 'Vincent Yao']","['Discount points', 'Mortgage decision making', 'Refinancing', 'Leverage', 'Financial literacy', 'Household finance', 'Inattentiveness']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301258,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,1
Employment protection and takeovers,"Labor restructuring is a key driver of takeovers and the associated synergy gains worldwide. In a difference-in-differences research design, we show that major increases in employment protection reduce takeover activity by 14–27% and the combined firm gains (synergies) by over half. Consistent with the labor channel behind these effects, deals with greater potential for workforce restructuring show a greater reduction in volume, number, and synergies. Increases in employment protection impede layoffs, resulting in wage costs that match the magnitude of synergy losses. Offer prices are not fully adjusted, with both bidders and targets exhibiting lower returns following the reforms.","['Olivier Dessaint', 'Andrey Golubov', 'Paolo Volpin']","['Employment protection', 'Takeovers', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Synergy gains', 'Premiums', 'Efficiency']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730096X,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,2
The impacts of political uncertainty on asset prices: Evidence from the Bo scandal in China,"Models of political risk predict that increases in political uncertainty cause stock prices to fall, especially for politically sensitive firms. We use the event of the Bo Xilai political scandal in 2012 in China as an exogenous shock to identify the impact of political uncertainty on asset prices. We document that the Bo scandal caused a significant drop in stock prices, especially for firms that are more politically sensitive. Further analysis shows that the stock price drop is mainly driven by a change in discount rate, providing strong support for the existence of priced political risk.","['Laura Xiaolei Liu', 'Haibing Shu', 'K.C.

Fire sale discount: Evidence from the sale of minority equity stakes,"Most empirical studies estimate the impact of fire sales either without the benefit of market prices from frequent trades, as with aircraft sales, or without observing transaction prices, as with the forced sales of equity securities by mutual funds facing outflows. We observe both by studying firms’ sales of minority equity stakes in publicly listed third parties. We estimate the distressed sale discount to be about 8% while controlling for liquidity and for industry, or about double the 4% estimated for equity sales by distressed mutual funds. The discount becomes 13–14% if the stake sold is more than 5% of the firm or is sold as a block.

Independent boards and innovation,"Much research has suggested that independent boards of directors are more effective in reducing agency costs and improving firm governance. How they influence innovation is less clear. Relying on regulatory changes, we show that firms that transition to independent boards focus on more crowded and familiar areas of technology. They patent and claim more and receive more total future citations to their patents. However, the citation increase comes mainly from incremental patents in the middle of the citation distribution; the numbers of uncited and highly cited patents—arguably associated with riskier innovation strategies—do not change significantly.","['Benjamin Balsmeier', 'Lee Fleming', 'Gustavo Manso']","['Corporate governance', 'Board composition', 'Innovation', 'Exploration and exploitation']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302355,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,3
Tracing out capital flows: How financially integrated banks respond to natural disasters,"Multi-market banks reallocate capital when local credit demand increases after natural disasters. Using property damage as an instrument for lending growth, we find credit in unaffected but connected markets declines by a little less than 50 cents per dollar of additional lending in shocked areas. However, banks shield their core markets because most of the decline comes from loans in areas where banks do not own branches. Moreover, banks increase sales of more-liquid loans and they bid up the rate on deposits in the connected markets. These actions help lessen the impact of the demand shock on credit supply.","['Kristle Romero Cortés', 'Philip E.

Limited disclosure and hidden orders in asset markets,Opacity assumes at least two prominent forms in asset markets. Dark exchanges and over-the-counter markets enable expert investors to hide their orders while originators carefully control the disclosure of fundamental information about the assets they source. We describe a simple model in which both forms of opacity – hidden orders and limited disclosure – complement one another. Costly investor expertise gives originators incentives to deliver assets of good quality. Keeping expert orders hidden generates the rents investors need to justify investing in expertise in the first place. Limiting disclosure mitigates the resulting adverse selection issues. Originators prefer to restrict the information they can convey to experts because it encourages the participation of non experts. This optimal organization of asset markets can be decentralized using standard financial arrangements.,"['Cyril Monnet', 'Erwan Quintin']","['Market design', 'Opacity', 'Asymmetric information']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302392,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,3
The effect of director experience on acquisition performance,"Prior research finds that firms hire directors for their acquisition experience, regardless of acquisition quality (whether their prior acquisitions earned positive or negative announcement returns). Using several short- and long-run measures, we examine the effects of directors’ acquisition experience on the acquisition performance of firms hiring them. We find that board acquisition experience is positively related to subsequent acquisition performance, demonstrating that firms appropriately value experience. Beyond experience itself, however, the quality of directors’ prior acquisitions is also important. Our results suggest that firms may be better served to select directors based upon both past acquisition experience and acquisition performance.","['Laura Casares Field', 'Anahit Mkrtchyan']","['Corporate governance', 'Board of directors', 'Mergers and acquisitions']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302318,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,3
Skill and luck in private equity performance,"Private equity (PE) performance is persistent, with PE firms consistently producing high (or low) net-of-fees returns. We use a new variance decomposition model to isolate three components of persistence. We find high long-term persistence: the spread in expected net-of-fee future returns between top and bottom quartile PE firms is 7–8 percentage points annually. This spread is estimated controlling for spurious persistence, which arises mechanically from the overlap of contemporaneous funds. Performance is noisy, however, making it difficult for investors to identify the PE funds with top quartile expected future performance and leaving little investable persistence.","['Arthur Korteweg', 'Morten Sorensen']","['Persistence', 'Private equity', 'Venture capital', 'Skill', 'Learning']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300430,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,3

Since the listing peak in 1996, the propensity to be listed is lower for all firm size categories and industries, the new list rate is low, and the delist rate is high. The high delist rate accounts for 46% of the listing gap and the low new list rate for 54%.

Failed bids for activism targets lead to improvements in operating performance, financial policy, and positive long-term abnormal returns, suggesting that activism enhances value.

Reputation and signaling in asset sales,"Static adverse selection models of security issuance show that informed issuers can perfectly reveal their private information by maintaining a costly stake in the securities they issue. This paper shows that allowing an issuer to both signal current security quality via retention and build a reputation for honesty leads that issuer to misreport quality even when owning a positive stake, that is, the equilibrium is neither separating nor pooling. An issuer retains less as reputation improves and prices are more sensitive to retention when the issuer has a worse reputation.",['Barney Hartman-Glaser'],"['Costly signaling', 'Reputation', 'Repeated games', 'Asset-backed securities']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301009,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,2
Informed trading and price discovery before corporate events,"Stock prices incorporate less news before negative events than positive events. Further, informed agents use less price aggressive (limit) orders before negative events and more price aggressive (market) orders before positive events (buy–sell asymmetry). Motivated by these patterns, we model the execution risk that informed agents impose on each other and relate the asymmetry to costly short selling. When investor base is narrow, security borrowing is difficult, or the magnitude of the event is small, buy–sell asymmetry is pronounced and price discovery before negative events is lower. Overall, we show that the strategies of informed traders influence the process of price formation in financial markets, as predicted by theory.","['Shmuel Baruch', 'Marios Panayides', 'Kumar Venkataraman']","['Informed trader', 'Insider trading', 'Limit order', 'Short selling', 'Buy–sell asymmetry']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300995,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,3
Banking integration and house price co-movement,"The correlation in house price growth across US states increased steadily between 1976 and 2000. This paper shows that the contemporaneous geographic integration of the US banking market, via the emergence of large banks, was a primary driver of this phenomenon. To this end, we first theoretically derive an appropriate measure of banking integration across state pairs and show that house price growth correlation is strongly related to this measure of financial integration. Our instrumental variable estimates suggest that banking integration can explain up to one-fourth of the rise in house price correlation over this period.","['Augustin Landier', 'David Sraer', 'David Thesmar']","['Financial integration', 'Co-movement', 'House prices']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300375,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,1
Growth through rigidity: An explanation for the rise in CEO pay,"The dramatic rise in CEO compensation during the 1990s and early 2000s is a longstanding puzzle. In this paper, we show that much of the rise can be explained by a tendency of firms to grant the same number of options each year. Number-rigidity implies that the grant-date value of option awards will grow with firm equity returns, which were very high on average during the tech boom. Further, other forms of CEO compensation did not adjust to offset the dramatic growth in the value of option pay. Number-rigidity in options can also explain the increased dispersion in pay, the difference in growth between the US and other countries, and the increased correlation between pay and firm-specific equity returns. We present evidence that number-rigidity arose from a lack of sophistication about option valuation that is akin to money illusion. We show that regulatory changes requiring transparent expensing of the grant-date value of options led to a decline in number-rigidity and helps explain why executive pay increased less with equity returns during the housing boom in the mid-2000s.","['Kelly Shue', 'Richard R.

Maximum likelihood estimation of the equity premium,"The equity premium — the expected return on the aggregate stock market less the government bill rate – is of central importance to the portfolio allocation of individuals, to the investment decisions of firms, and to model calibration and testing. This quantity is usually estimated from the sample average excess return. We propose an alternative estimator, based on maximum likelihood, that takes into account information contained in dividends and prices. Applied to the postwar sample, our method leads to an economically significant reduction from 6.4% to 5.1%. Simulation results show that our method produces more reliable estimates under a wide range of specifications.","['Efstathios Avdis', 'Jessica A.

Socioeconomic status and learning from financial information,"The majority of lower socioeconomic status (SES) households in the U.S. and Europe do not have stock investments, which is detrimental to wealth accumulation. Here, we examine one explanation for this puzzling fact, namely, that economic adversity may influence how people learn from financial information. Using experimental and survey data from the U.S. and Romania, we find that lower SES individuals form more pessimistic beliefs about the distribution of stock returns and are less likely to invest in stocks when these investments are likely to have good outcomes. SES-related differences in pessimism may help explain variation in investments across households.","['Camelia M. Kuhnen', 'Andrei C.

Intangible capital and the investment-q relation,"The neoclassical theory of investment has mainly been tested with physical investment, but we show that it also helps explain intangible investment. At the firm level, Tobin’s q explains physical and intangible investment roughly equally well, and it explains total investment even better. Compared with physical capital, intangible capital adjusts more slowly to changes in investment opportunities. The classic q theory performs better in firms and years with more intangible capital: Total and even physical investment are better explained by Tobin’s q and are less sensitive to cash flow. At the macro level, Tobin’s q explains intangible investment many times better than physical investment. We propose a simple, new Tobin’s q proxy that accounts for intangible capital, and we show that it is a superior proxy for both physical and intangible investment opportunities.","['Ryan H.

How persistent is private equity performance? Evidence from deal-level data,"The persistence of returns is a critical issue for investors in their choice of private equity managers. In this paper, we analyse buyout performance persistence in new ways, using a unique database containing cash flow data on 13,523 portfolio company investments by 865 buyout funds. We focus on unique realized deals and find that persistence of fund managers has substantially declined as the private equity sector has matured and become more competitive. Private equity has, therefore, largely conformed to the pattern found in most other asset classes in which past performance is a poor predictor of the future.","['Reiner Braun', 'Tim Jenkinson', 'Ingo Stoff']","['Private equity', 'Returns', 'Performance persistence', 'Portfolio companies']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301775,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,2
Efficiency and stability of a financial architecture with too-interconnected-to-fail institutions,"The regulation of large interconnected financial institutions has become a key policy issue. To improve financial stability, regulators have proposed limiting banks’ size and interconnectedness. I estimate a network-based model of the over-the-counter interbank lending market in the US and quantify the efficiency-stability implications of this policy. Trading efficiency decreases with limits on interconnectedness because the intermediation chains become longer. While restricting the interconnectedness of banks improves stability, the effect is non-monotonic. Stability also improves with higher liquidity requirements, when banks have access to liquidity during the crisis, and when failed banks’ depositors maintain confidence in the banking system.",['Michael Gofman'],"['Financial regulation', 'Networks', 'Trading efficiency', 'Contagion risk', 'Federal funds market']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302471,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,1

Interbank networks in the National Banking Era: Their purpose and their role in the Panic of 1893,"The unit banking structure of the United States produced a uniquely important interbank correspondent network. During the National Banking Era, this network normally provided banks with access to money markets, facilitated payment processing, and helped banks meet legal reserve requirements. In crises, network connections could be a source of liquidity risk. That risk became evident during the Panic of 1893, when New York suspended convertibility. Banks with high two-sided liquidity risk (those holding more of their liquid assets with their correspondents and funded to a greater extent by deposits of other banks) were particularly exposed and more likely to close.","['Charles W.

Large shareholders and credit ratings,"This paper addresses regulatory concerns that large shareholders of credit rating agencies can influence the rating process. Unlike Standard & Poor's, which is a privately held division of McGraw-Hill, Moody's is a public company listed on the NYSE. From 2001 to 2010, Moody's has two shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway and Davis Selected Advisors, which collectively own about 23.5% of Moody's. Moody's ratings on bonds issued by important investee firms of these two stable large shareholders are more favorable relative to S&P, as well as Fitch, ratings. We exploit Moody's initial public offering in 2000 to address endogeneity and to mitigate concerns that the results are driven by issuer characteristics or by the greater informativeness of Moody's ratings. S&P's parent, McGraw-Hill, has a large shareholder for much less time, and some weak evidence exists that S&P ratings are relatively more favorable toward the owners of McGraw-Hill. These findings are consistent with regulatory concerns about the ownership and governance of rating agencies, especially those that are publicly listed.","['Simi Kedia', 'Shivaram Rajgopal', 'Xing\u2009(Alex) Zhou']","[""Moody's"", 'Credit rating agencies', 'Ownership structure', 'Conflict of interest', 'Difference-in-differences', 'Corporate bond', 'CMBS']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300442,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,3

Using a comprehensive sample of publicly listed firms in 30 countries over the period 2001–2010, we find instead that greater foreign institutional ownership fosters long-term investment in tangible, intangible, and human capital. Foreign institutional ownership also leads to significant increases in innovation output. We identify these effects by exploiting the exogenous variation in foreign institutional ownership that follows the addition of a stock to the MSCI indexes.

Leverage and strategic preemption: Lessons from entry plans and incumbent investments,"This paper empirically investigates the effect of leverage on strategic preemption. Using new data on entry plans and incumbent investments from the American casino industry, I find that high leverage prevents incumbents from responding to entry threats. Facing the same set of entry plans, low-leverage incumbents expand physical capacity (by 30%), whereas high-leverage incumbents do not. This difference in investment matters because capacity installations preempt eventual entry. Stock market reactions to withdrawn plans imply that effective preemption increases incumbent firm value by 5%.

Using the Securities and Exchange Commission decimalization regulation as a shock to stock liquidity, we establish that enhanced liquidity decreases default risk.

Of the two mechanisms, the informational efficiency channel has higher explanatory power than the corporate governance channel.","['Jonathan Brogaard', 'Dan Li', 'Ying Xia']","['Stock liquidity', 'Bankruptcy risk', 'EDF', 'Price efficiency', 'Governance']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300405,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,3

On average, inside tips originate from corporate executives and reach buy-side investors after three links in the network. Inside traders earn prodigious returns of 35% over 21 days, with more central traders earning greater returns, as information conveyed through social networks improves price efficiency.

Investor flows and fragility in corporate bond funds,"This paper explores flow patterns in corporate bond mutual funds. We show that corporate bond funds exhibit a concave flow-to-performance relationship: their outflows are sensitive to bad performance more than their inflows are sensitive to good performance. Moreover, corporate bond funds tend to have greater sensitivity of outflows to bad performance when they have more illiquid assets and when the overall market illiquidity is high. These results point to the possibility of fragility in the fast-growing corporate bond market. The illiquidity of corporate bonds may generate a first-mover advantage among investors in corporate bond funds, amplifying their response to bad performance.","['Itay Goldstein', 'Hao Jiang', 'David T.

We find that VOV exposure is a significant determinant of hedge fund returns. After controlling for fund characteristics, we find a robust and significant negative risk premium for VOV exposure in the cross section of hedge fund returns. We corroborate our results using statistical and parameterized proxies of VOV over a longer sample period.","['Vikas Agarwal', 'Y. Eser Arisoy', 'Narayan Y.

Also, intermediation chains lengthened by 20% following the collapse of a flagship dealer in 2008 and even more for institutions strongly connected to this dealer. Finally, dealers drastically reduced their inventory during the crisis.","['Marco Di Maggio', 'Amir Kermani', 'Zhaogang Song']","['Corporate bond', 'Dealer network', 'Intermediation chain', 'Over-the-counter financial market', 'Trading relationship']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730003X,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,2
Debt correlations in the wake of the financial crisis: What are appropriate default correlations for structured products?,"This paper proposes several frameworks to estimate the appropriate default correlations for structured products, each of which jointly considers the role of co-movements in modeled risk characteristics and unmodeled systematic risk, or ‘frailty.’ We contrast our estimates with credit rating agencies’ default correlation assumptions, which were only 0.01 for Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) pre-crisis and have increased to 0.03 post-crisis. In contrast, the joint consideration of observable risk factors and frailty leads to substantially higher estimates of 0.12. We show that this translates into CLOs with credit risk understated by 26%, suggesting caution for the post-crisis structured finance market.","['Jordan Nickerson', 'John M.

We find no evidence that staggered board changes are negatively related to firm value. However, we find a positive relation for firms engaged in innovation and where stakeholder relationships matter more. This suggests that staggered boards promote value creation for some firms by committing the firm to undertaking long-term projects and bonding it to the relationship-specific investments of its stakeholders. Our results are robust to matching procedures and an exogenous change in Massachusetts corporate law that mandated staggered boards.","['K.J. Martijn Cremers', 'Lubomir P. Litov', 'Simone M.

The source of information in prices and investment-price sensitivity,"This paper shows that real decisions depend not only on the total amount of information in prices, but the source of this information—a manager learns from prices when they contain information not possessed by him. We use the staggered enforcement of insider trading laws across 27 countries as a shock to the source of information that leaves total information unchanged: enforcement reduces (increases) managers’ (outsiders’) contribution to the stock price. Consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model, enforcement increases investment-q sensitivity, even when controlling for total price informativeness. The effect is larger in industries where learning is likely to be stronger, and in emerging countries where outsider information acquisition rises most post-enforcement. Enforcement does not increase the sensitivity of investment to cash flow, a non-price measure of investment opportunities. These findings suggest that extant measures of price efficiency should be rethought when evaluating real efficiency. More broadly, our paper provides causal evidence that managers learn from prices, by using a shock to price informativeness.","['Alex Edmans', 'Sudarshan Jayaraman', 'Jan Schneemeier']","['Financial efficiency', 'Real efficiency', 'Real effects of financial markets', 'Insider trading']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301344,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,1
Advising shareholders in takeovers,"This paper studies the advisory role of the board of directors in takeovers.

The analysis relates the influence of the board on target shareholders and the reaction of the market to its recommendations to various characteristics of the acquirer and the target. I also show that the expected target shareholder value can decrease with the expertise of the board and it is maximized when the board is biased against the takeover. Generally, uninformative and ignored recommendations are not necessarily evidence that the target board has no influence on the outcome of the takeover. Perhaps surprisingly, under the optimal board structure, target shareholders ignore the recommendations of the board, which are never informative in equilibrium.",['Doron Levit'],"['Board of directors', 'Communication', 'Corporate governance', 'Free-riding', 'Takeover']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302520,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,3
Reference-dependent preferences and the risk–return trade-off,"This paper studies the cross-sectional risk–return trade-off in the stock market. A fundamental principle in finance is the positive relation between risk and expected return. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the opposite. Using several intuitive risk measures, we show that the negative risk–return relation is much more pronounced among firms in which investors face prior losses, but the risk–return relation is positive among firms in which investors face prior gains. We consider a number of possible explanations for this new empirical finding and conclude that reference-dependent preference is the most promising explanation.","['Huijun Wang', 'Jinghua Yan', 'Jianfeng Yu']","['Prospect theory', 'Risk–return trade-off', 'Risk', 'Uncertainty', 'Capital gains overhang']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301787,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,2
Do takeover laws matter? Evidence from five decades of hostile takeovers,"This study evaluates the relation between hostile takeovers and 17 takeover laws from 1965 to 2014. Using a data set of largely exogenous legal changes, we find that certain takeover laws, such as poison pill and business combination laws, have no discernible impact on hostile activity, while others such as fair price laws have reduced hostile takeovers. We construct a Takeover Index from the laws and find that higher takeover protection is associated with lower firm value, consistent with entrenchment and agency costs. However, conditional on a bid, firms with more protection achieve higher premiums, consistent with increased bargaining power.","['Matthew D. Cain', 'Stephen B.

The effects of credit default swap trading on information asymmetry in syndicated loans,"This study shows that initiation of credit default swap (CDS) trading for an entity's debt increases the share of loans retained by loan syndicate lead arrangers and increases loan spread. These findings are consistent with CDS initiation reducing the effectiveness of a lead arranger's stake in the loan to serve as a mechanism to address the adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the loan syndicate. Additional findings corroborate this interpretation by revealing a moderating effect for firms with greater transparency, for loans originated by a lead arranger with a strong reputation in this market, and for firms with relatively illiquid CDS markets.","['Dan Amiram', 'William H.

U.S. multinationals and cash holdings,"U.S. multinational firms hold significantly more cash than domestic firms. I study this cash differential using a dynamic model featuring corporate physical and intangible investment, cross-border decisions, and financial policies. I find that the cash differential diminishes by 42% if repatriation costs are set to zero. Hence, costly repatriation induces cash accumulation offshore. Further, firms that invest overseas have different ex ante cash policies from firms that do not. I examine this self-selection effect by eliminating heterogeneous intangibility across multinational and domestic firms, which reduces the cash differential by 28%. I also examine the likelihood of corporate inversion under federal regulations. The estimated annual tax loss to the U.S. Treasury from inversions is reduced from $2.2 billion to $1.3 billion if the requirements for foreign ownership are tightened from 20% to 50%.",['Tiantian Gu'],"['Cash holdings', 'Multinationals', 'Intangibles', 'Structural estimation']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300983,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,2
Compensation goals and firm performance,"Using a large data set of performance goals employed in executive incentive contracts, we find that a disproportionately large number of firms exceed their goals by a small margin as compared to the number that fall short of the goal by a similar margin. This asymmetry is particularly acute for earnings goals, when compensation is contingent on a single goal, when the pay-performance relationship around the goal is concave-shaped, and for grants with non-equity-based payouts. Firms that exceed their compensation target by a small margin are more likely to beat the target the next period and CEOs of firms that miss their targets are more likely to experience a forced turnover. Firms that just exceed their Earnings Per Share (EPS) goals have higher abnormal accruals and lower Research and Development (R&D) expenditures, and firms that just exceed their profit goals have lower Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenditures. Overall, our results highlight some of the costs of linking managerial compensation to specific compensation targets.","['Benjamin Bennett', 'J.

Information Shocks and Short-Term Market Underreaction,"Using jumps in stock prices as a proxy for large information shocks, we provide evidence consistent with short-term underreaction in the US equity market. Strategies long (short) stocks with positive (negative) lagged jump returns earn significantly positive returns over the next one- to three-month horizons. The results based on intraday jumps, especially overnight jumps, provide further evidence consistent with underreaction. The underreaction is robust to controlling for other firm characteristics, extends stock return momentum over intermediate to short horizons, and captures market underreaction to information shocks beyond earnings surprises.

The advantages of using excess returns to model the term structure,"We advocate the use of excess returns rather than yields or log prices in analysing the risk neutral dynamics of the term structure. We show that under standard assumptions, excess returns are affine in the risk neutral innovations in the factors. This framework has several important advantages. First, it allows for an easy estimation of models that are more flexible than the AR(1). Indeed, we estimate models with more general dynamics, like ARFIMA(p, d, q), almost as easily as AR(1). Second, within our framework the dimension of the unrestricted model is the same for the AR(1) as it is for the richer models, and does not expand in line with the state vector as it does in a yield or log price framework. This makes it appropriate to test all of these risk neutral dynamic specifications against the same OLS unrestricted alternative. Our results for the US Treasury bond market show that the unrestricted model is preferred to the AR(1) by the Bayesian Information Criterion, but the opposite conclusion is reached for more flexible models. A final advantage of the excess returns framework is that the pricing errors are much lower than for the equivalent log price system.","['Adam Goliński', 'Peter Spencer']","['Term structure', 'Excess return framework', 'Long memory']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300922,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,1
"Debt enforcement, investment, and risk taking across countries","We argue that the prospect of an imperfect enforcement of debt contracts in default reduces shareholder–debtholder conflicts and induces leveraged firms to invest more and take on less risk as they approach financial distress. To test these predictions, we use a large panel of firms in 41 countries with heterogeneous debt enforcement characteristics. Consistent with our model, we find that the relation between debt enforcement and firms’ investment and risk depends on the firm-specific probability of default. A differences-in-differences analysis of firms’ investment and risk taking in response to bankruptcy reforms that make debt more renegotiable confirms the cross-country evidence.","['Giovanni Favara', 'Erwan Morellec', 'Enrique Schroth', 'Philip Valta']","['Debt enforcement', 'Default', 'Investment', 'Asset sales', 'Risk-taking']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301532,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,1

Hence, midpoint dark pools on top, non-midpoint dark pools in the middle, and lit markets at the bottom.

Moral hazard in active asset management,"We consider a model of active asset management in which mutual fund managers exert unobservable effort to earn excess returns. Investors allocate capital to actively managed funds and passively managed products. In equilibrium, investors are indifferent between investing an additional dollar with an active manager or with a passively managed product. As passively managed products become more attractive to investors, active managers’ revenues from portfolio-management services fall, reducing their effort incentives. More-severe decreasing-returns-to-scale are also associated with reduced incentives and increased moral hazard. Performance-based fees and holdings-based data are all unlikely to mitigate moral hazard.","['David C.

News implied volatility and disaster concerns,"We construct a text-based measure of uncertainty starting in 1890 using front-page articles of the Wall Street Journal. News implied volatility (NVIX) peaks during stock market crashes, times of policy-related uncertainty, world wars, and financial crises. In US postwar data, periods when NVIX is high are followed by periods of above average stock returns, even after controlling for contemporaneous and forward-looking measures of stock market volatility. News coverage related to wars and government policy explains most of the time variation in risk premia our measure identifies. Over the longer 1890–2009 sample that includes the Great Depression and two world wars, high NVIX predicts high future returns in normal times and rises just before transitions into economic disasters.

How collateral laws shape lending and sectoral activity,"We demonstrate the central importance of creditors’ ability to use movable assets as collateral (as distinct from immovable real estate) when borrowing from banks. Using a unique cross-country micro-level loan data set containing loan-to-value ratios for different assets, we find that loan-to-values of loans collateralized with movable assets are lower in countries with weak collateral laws, relative to immovable assets, and that lending is biased toward the use of immovable assets. Using sector-level data, we find that weak movable collateral laws create distortions in the allocation of resources that favor immovable-based production and investment. An analysis of Slovakia's collateral law reform confirms our findings.","['Charles W.

Bank rescues and bailout expectations: The erosion of market discipline during the financial crisis,"We design a novel test for changes in market discipline based on the relation between firm-specific risk, credit spreads, and equity returns. We use our method to analyze the evolution of bailout expectations during the recent financial crisis. We find that bailout expectations peaked in reaction to government interventions following the failure of Lehman Brothers, and returned to pre-crisis levels following the initiation of the Dodd-Frank Act. We do not find such changes in market discipline for nonfinancial firms. Finally, market discipline is weaker for government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and systemically important banks (SIBs) than for investment banks.","['Florian Hett', 'Alexander Schmidt']","['Bailout', 'Implicit guarantees', 'Too-big-to-fail', 'Market discipline', 'Hedge ratio']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302532,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,3
"Bank capital, liquid reserves, and insolvency risk","We develop a dynamic model of banking to assess the effects of liquidity and leverage requirements on banks’ financing decisions and insolvency risk. In this model, banks face taxation, issuance costs of securities, and default costs and maximize shareholder value by choosing their debt-to-asset ratio, deposits-to-debt ratio, liquid asset holdings, equity issuance and default policies in response to these frictions as well as regulatory requirements. Our analytic characterization of the bank policy choices shows that imposing liquidity requirements leads to lower bank losses in default at the cost of an increased likelihood of default. Combining liquidity and leverage requirements reduces both the likelihood of default and the magnitude of bank losses in default.","['Julien Hugonnier', 'Erwan Morellec']","['Banks', 'Liquidity buffers', 'Capital structure', 'Insolvency risk', 'Regulation']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300971,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,2
Idiosyncratic risk and the manager,"We develop a model to characterize and quantify the effects of stock, option, and fixed compensation on a manager’s risk-taking incentive and investment choice. We find the average chief executive officer’s (CEO) compensation contract incentivizes overinvestment by 1.3 percentage points per year, with significant variation across firms and over time. We estimate a value of CEO effort implied by compensation contracts and find it to be strongly related to firm intangibility. Finally, we assess the effects on investment of FAS 123R and a hypothetical ban on option grants and find heterogeneous responses that depend on firm volatility and the prior structure of compensation.","['Brent Glover', 'Oliver Levine']","['Corporate investment', 'Executive compensation', 'Managerial incentives', 'Agency conflicts', 'Risk taking']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301502,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,2
"Employee bargaining power, inter-firm competition, and equity-based compensation","We develop a model to illustrate that equity-based compensation for non-executive employees and product market decisions are related. When the product market is competitive and employees have low bargaining power, the unique equilibrium is for each firm’s owners to offer equity-based compensation to their employees. In this setting, equity-based compensation leads to a lower wage rate, which makes each firm more competitive with its rival. However, this unique equilibrium is a Prisoner’s Dilemma for the firms’ original owners. Our results are consistent with several empirical regularities and provide predictions on when firms will offer equity-based compensation to their employees.","['Francesco Bova', 'Liyan Yang']","['Employee bargaining power', 'Market competition', 'Equity compensation']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301538,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,2
Tail risk in hedge funds: A unique view from portfolio holdings,"We develop a new systematic tail risk measure for equity-oriented hedge funds to examine the impact of tail risk on fund performance and to identify the sources of tail risk. We find that tail risk affects the cross-sectional variation in fund returns and that investments in both tail-sensitive stocks and options drive tail risk. Moreover, leverage and exposure to funding liquidity shocks are important determinants of tail risk. We find evidence of some funds being able to time tail risk exposure prior to the 2008–2009 financial crisis.","['Vikas Agarwal', 'Stefan Ruenzi', 'Florian Weigert']","['Hedge funds', 'Tail risk', 'Portfolio holdings', 'Funding liquidity risk', 'Leverage']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730123X,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,3
"CEO talent, CEO compensation, and product market competition","We develop a structural industry equilibrium model to show how competitive chief executive officer (CEO)-firm matching and product markets jointly determine firm value and CEO pay. We analytically derive testable implications for the effects of product market characteristics on firm size, CEO pay, and CEO impact on firm value. CEO talent matters more in more competitive markets with greater product substitutabilities. Our CEO impact estimates are much higher than those obtained by previous structural approaches that abstract away from CEO market segmentation. The estimates differ across industries primarily due to variation in product market competition, rather than variation in the CEO talent distribution.","['Hae\xa0Won\xa0(Henny) Jung', 'Ajay Subramanian']","['CEO talent', 'CEO pay', 'Product market competition', 'Structural estimation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300740,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,1
What do measures of real-time corporate sales say about earnings surprises and post-announcement returns?,"We develop real-time proxies of retail corporate sales from multiple sources, including ∼50 million mobile devices. These measures contain information from both the earnings quarter (“within quarter”) and the period between the quarter-end and the earnings announcement date (“post quarter”). Our within-quarter measure is powerful in explaining quarterly sales growth, revenue surprises, and earnings surprises, generating average excess announcement returns of 3.4%. However, our post-quarter measure is related negatively to announcement returns and positively to post-announcement returns. When post-quarter private information is positive, managers, at announcement, provide pessimistic guidance and use negative language. This effect is more pronounced when, post-announcement, management insiders trade. We conclude that managers do not fully disclose their private information and instead bias their disclosures down when in possession of positive private information. The data suggest that they could be motivated in part by subsequent personal stock-trading opportunities.","['Kenneth Froot', 'Namho Kang', 'Gideon Ozik', 'Ronnie Sadka']","['Real-time corporate sales', 'Earnings announcement', 'Corporate disclosure', 'Insider trading']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300776,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,1
Do staggered boards harm shareholders?,"We examine the Cohen and Wang (2013) conclusion that a staggered board lowers firm value based on the stock price reaction to two 2010 Delaware court rulings in the Airgas, Inc. case. The first ruling weakened the potency of a staggered board and the second restored it. We find that the Cohen and Wang results, for their sample, become insignificant after excluding a few penny stocks, stocks with value below $10 million, or over-the-counter (non-exchange) stocks. The effects of the rulings are also insignificant for an alternative sample.","['Yakov Amihud', 'Stoyan Stoyanov']","['Staggered board', 'Classified board', 'Corporate governance', 'Antitakeover measures', 'Takeover defense', 'Airgas']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301994,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,2
High frequency trading and the 2008 short-sale ban,"We examine the effects of high-frequency traders (HFTs) on liquidity using the September 2008 short sale-ban. To disentangle the separate impacts of short selling by HFTs and non-HFTs, we use an instrumental variables approach exploiting differences in the ban's cross-sectional impact on HFTs and non-HFTs. Non-HFTs’ short selling improves liquidity, as measured by bid-ask spreads. HFTs’ short selling has the opposite effect by adversely selecting limit orders, which can decrease liquidity supplier competition and reduce trading by non-HFTs. The results highlight that some HFTs’ activities are harmful to liquidity during the extremely volatile short-sale ban period.","['Jonathan Brogaard', 'Terrence Hendershott', 'Ryan Riordan']","['High frequency trading', 'Short selling', 'Liquidity']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300211,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,1
Dealer financial conditions and lender-of-last-resort facilities,"We examine the financial conditions of dealers that participated in two of the Federal Reserve's lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) facilities—the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)—that provided liquidity against a range of assets during 2008–2009. Dealers with lower equity returns and greater leverage prior to borrowing from the facilities were more likely to participate in the programs, borrow more, and, in the case of the TSLF, at higher bidding rates. Dealers with less liquid collateral on their balance sheets before the facilities were introduced also tended to borrow more. The results suggest that both financial performance and balance sheet liquidity play a role in LOLR utilization.","['Viral V. Acharya', 'Michael J. Fleming', 'Warren B.

Board reforms and firm value: Worldwide evidence,"We examine the impact of corporate board reforms on firm value in 41 countries. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that board reforms increase firm value. Reforms involving board and audit committee independence, but not reforms involving separation of chairman and chief executive officer positions, drive the valuation increases. In addition, while comply-or-explain reforms result in a greater increase in firm value than rule-based reforms, the effects of reforms are similar across civil law and common law countries. Further investigation shows that the subsequent change in board independence plays an important role in explaining the effectiveness of the reforms.","['Larry Fauver', 'Mingyi Hung', 'Xi Li', 'Alvaro G.

Investment banking relationships and analyst affiliation bias: The impact of the global settlement on sanctioned and non-sanctioned banks,"We examine the impact of the Global Settlement on affiliation bias in analyst recommendations. Using a broad measure of investment bank-firm relationships, we find a substantial reduction in analyst affiliation bias following the settlement for sanctioned banks. In contrast, we find strong evidence of bias both before and after the settlement for affiliated analysts at non-sanctioned banks. Our results suggest that the settlement led to an increase in the expected costs of issuing biased coverage at sanctioned banks, while concurrent self-regulatory organization rule changes were largely ineffective at reducing the influence of investment banking on analyst research at large non-sanctioned banks.","['Shane A.

WSJ Category Kings – The impact of media attention on consumer and mutual fund investment decisions,"We exploit a novel natural experiment to establish a causal relation between media attention and consumer investment behavior, independent of the conveyed information. Our findings indicate a 31% local average increase in quarterly capital flows into mutual funds mentioned in a prominent Wall Street Journal “Category Kings” ranking list, compared to those funds which just missed making the list. This flow increase is about seven times larger than extra flows due to the well-documented performance-flow relation. Other funds in the same fund complex receive substantial extra flows as well, especially in smaller complexes. There is no increase in flows when the Wall Street Journal publishes similar lists absent the prominence of the Category Kings labeling. We show mutual fund managers react to the incentive created by the media effect in a strategic way predicted by theory, and present evidence for the existence of propagation mechanisms including increased fund complex advertising subsequent to having a Category King and increased efficacy of subsequent fund media mentions.","['Ron Kaniel', 'Robert Parham']","['Mutual funds', 'Investor attention', 'Incentives', 'Flows', 'Regression discontinuity']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302008,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,2
Do corporate taxes hinder innovation?,"We exploit staggered changes in state-level corporate tax rates to show that an increase in taxes reduces future innovation. A variety of tests, including those based on policy discontinuity at contiguous counties straddling borders of politically similar states, show that local economic conditions do not drive our results. The effect we document is consistent across the innovation spectrum: taxes affect not only patenting and R&D investment but also new product introductions, which we measure using textual analysis. Our empirical results are consistent with models that highlight the role of higher corporate taxes in reducing innovator incentives and discouraging risk-taking.","['Abhiroop Mukherjee', 'Manpreet Singh', 'Alminas Žaldokas']","['Innovation', 'Patents', 'Research and development', 'New products', 'Corporate taxes']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300041,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,1
The effect of asymmetric information on product market outcomes,"We explore how asymmetric information in financial markets affects outcomes in product markets. Difference-in-difference tests around brokerage house merger/closure events (which increase asymmetric information through reductions in analyst coverage) indicate worse industry-adjusted sales growth for shocked firms than for their peers. Our results are consistent with Bolton and Scharfstein's (1990) tradeoff between investor agency concerns and predation risk. Further support is found in stronger treatment effects among firms with ex ante greater agency concerns, financing constraints, asymmetric information, and those operating in ex ante more competitive (fluid) product market spaces.

"The term structure of credit spreads, firm fundamentals, and expected stock returns","We explore the link between credit and equity markets by considering the informational content of the term structure of credit spreads. A shallower credit term structure predicts decreases in default risk and increases in future profitability, as well as favorable earnings surprises. Further, the slope of the credit term structure negatively predicts future stock returns. While systematic slope risk is priced, information diffusion from the credit market to equities, particularly in less visible stocks, plays an additional role in accounting for return predictability from credit slopes. That is, such predictability is less evident in stocks with high institutional ownership, analyst coverage, and liquidity, and vice versa.","['Bing Han', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam', 'Yi Zhou']","['Cross section of stock return', 'Credit default spreads', 'Term structure', 'Information diffusion']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300028,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,1
Pilot CEOs and corporate innovation,"We find evidence that chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) hobby of flying airplanes is associated with significantly better innovation outcomes, measured by patents and citations, greater innovation effectiveness, and more diverse and original patents. We rule out alternative explanations, leading us to conclude that CEO pilot credentials capture the personality trait of sensation seeking. Sensation seeking combines risk taking with a desire to pursue novel experiences and has been associated with creativity. Our evidence highlights sensation seeking as a valuable personality trait that can be used to identify CEOs who are likely to drive innovation success.","['Jayanthi Sunder', 'Shyam V.

The effects of institutional investor objectives on firm valuation and governance,"We find that ownership by different types of institutional investors has varying implications for future firm misvaluation and governance characteristics. Dedicated institutional investors decrease future firm misvaluation, in both direction and magnitude, relative to fundamentals. In contrast, transient institutional investors have the opposite effect. Using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation FD as an exogenous shock to information dissemination, we find evidence consistent with dedicated institutions having an information advantage. Similarly, dedicated investors are associated with better future governance characteristics, while transient investors are not. The valuation effects are primarily driven by institutional portfolio concentration while the governance effects are driven by portfolio turnover. These results imply a more nuanced relationship between institutional ownership and firm value and corporate governance.","['Paul Borochin', 'Jie Yang']","['Institutional investors', 'Investor type', 'Dedicated', 'Transient', 'Misvaluation', 'Corporate governance', 'Blockholding', 'Portfolio turnover', 'Information dissemination', 'SEC Regulation FD']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301307,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,1
Intermediary asset pricing: New evidence from many asset classes,"We find that shocks to the equity capital ratio of financial intermediaries—Primary Dealer counterparties of the New York Federal Reserve—possess significant explanatory power for cross-sectional variation in expected returns. This is true not only for commonly studied equity and government bond market portfolios, but also for other more sophisticated asset classes such as corporate and sovereign bonds, derivatives, commodities, and currencies. Our intermediary capital risk factor is strongly procyclical, implying countercyclical intermediary leverage. The price of risk for intermediary capital shocks is consistently positive and of similar magnitude when estimated separately for individual asset classes, suggesting that financial intermediaries are marginal investors in many markets and hence key to understanding asset prices.","['Zhiguo He', 'Bryan Kelly', 'Asaf Manela']","['Sophisticated asset classes', 'Primary dealers', 'Intermediary capital', 'Leverage cycles']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1730212X,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,1
Changes in corporate effective tax rates over the past 25 years,"We investigate systematic changes in corporate effective tax rates over the past 25 years and find that effective tax rates have decreased significantly. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the decline in effective tax rates is not concentrated in multinational firms; effective tax rates have declined at approximately the same rate for both multinational and domestic firms. Moreover, within multinational firms, both foreign and domestic effective rates have decreased. Finally, changes in firm characteristics and declining foreign statutory tax rates explain little of the overall decrease in effective rates.","['Scott D. Dyreng', 'Michelle Hanlon', 'Edward L.

"Risk, ambiguity, and the exercise of employee stock options","We investigate the importance of ambiguity, or Knightian uncertainty, in executives’ stock option exercise decisions. We develop an empirical estimate of ambiguity and include it in regression models alongside the traditional measure of risk, equity volatility. We show that each variable has a significant effect on the timing of option exercises, with volatility causing executives to hold options longer to preserve option value, and ambiguity increasing the tendency for executives to exercise early.","['Yehuda Izhakian', 'David Yermack']","['Ambiguity measurement', 'Ambiguity aversion', 'Employee stock options']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302367,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,1
"Credit default swaps, exacting creditors and corporate liquidity management","We investigate the liquidity management of firms following the inception of credit default swaps (CDS) markets on their debt, which allow hedging and speculative trading on credit risk to be carried out by creditors and other parties. We find that reference firms hold more cash after CDS trading commences on their debt. The increase in cash holdings is more pronounced for CDS firms that do not pay dividends and have a higher marginal value of liquidity. For CDS firms with higher cash flow volatility, these increased cash holdings do not entail higher leverage. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that CDS-referenced firms adopt more conservative liquidity policies to avoid negotiations with more exacting creditors.","['Marti G.

Tax uncertainty and retirement savings diversification,"We investigate the optimal savings decisions for investors with access to pre-tax (traditional) and post-tax (Roth) versions of tax-advantaged retirement accounts. The model features a progressive tax schedule and uncertainty over future tax rates. Traditional accounts are valuable for hedging retirement account performance and managing current income near tax-bracket cutoffs, whereas Roth accounts allow investors to mitigate uncertainty over future tax schedules. The optimal asset location policy for most households involves diversifying between traditional and Roth vehicles.

Is economic uncertainty priced in the cross-section of stock returns?,We investigate the role of economic uncertainty in the cross-sectional pricing of individual stocks and equity portfolios. We estimate stock exposure to an economic uncertainty index and show that stocks in the lowest uncertainty beta decile generate 6% more annualized risk-adjusted return compared to stocks in the highest uncertainty beta decile. We find that the uncertainty premium is driven by the outperformance (underperformance) by stocks with negative (positive) uncertainty beta.

Do exogenous changes in passive institutional ownership affect corporate governance and firm value?,"We investigate whether corporations and their executives react to an exogenous change in passive institutional ownership and alter their corporate governance structure. We find that exogenous increases in passive ownership lead to increases in CEO power and fewer new independent director appointments. Consistent with these changes not being beneficial for shareholders, we observe negative announcement returns to the appointments of new independent directors. We also show that firms carry out worse mergers and acquisitions after exogenous increases in passive ownership.

Customer–supplier relationships and corporate tax avoidance,"We investigate whether firms in close customer–supplier relationships are better able to identify and implement tax avoidance strategies via supply chains. Consistent with our prediction, we find that both principal customers and their dependent suppliers avoid more taxes than other firms. Further analysis suggests that principal customers and dependent suppliers likely engage in tax strategies involving shifting profits to tax haven subsidiaries. Moreover, tax benefits appear to explain both principal customer firms’ and dependent supplier firms’ organizational decisions. Overall, our study provides evidence of the importance of tax avoidance as a source of gains from these relationships.","['Ling Cen', 'Edward L.

"Precautionary savings, retirement planning and misperceptions of financial literacy","We measure financial literacy among LinkedIn members, complementing standard questions with additional questions that allow us to gauge self-perceptions of financial literacy. Average financial literacy is surprisingly low given the demographics of our sample: fewer than two-thirds of chief financial officers, chief executive officers, and chief operating officers complete the test correctly. Financial literacy, precautionary savings and retirement planning are positively correlated, but this is mostly driven by perceived, not actual, literacy: controlling for self-perceptions, actual literacy has low predictive power.

Debt maturity and the liquidity of secondary debt markets,"We model the debt maturity choice of firms in the presence of fixed issuance costs in the primary market and search frictions in the secondary market for debt. In the secondary market, short maturities improve the bargaining position of sellers, which reduces the required issuance yield. Long maturities reduce reissuance costs. The optimally chosen maturity trades off both considerations. Equilibrium exhibits inefficiently short maturity choices. An individual firm does not internalize that a longer maturity increases expected gains from trade in the secondary market, which attracts more buyers and, hence, facilitates the sale of debt issued by other firms.","['Max Bruche', 'Anatoli Segura']","['Debt maturity', 'Search', 'Liquidity']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300600,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,3
Explaining CEO retention in misreporting firms,"We propose a framework that advances our understanding of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) retention decisions in misreporting firms. Consistent with economic intuition, outside directors are more likely to fire (retain) CEOs when retention (replacement) costs are high relative to replacement (retention) costs. When the decision is ambiguous because neither cost dominates, outside directors are more likely to retain the CEO when they both benefit from selling stock in the misreporting period. We show that joint abnormal selling captures director–CEO alignment incrementally to biographical overlap. This new proxy operationalizes information sharing and trust, making it useful for studying economic decision-making embedded in social relationships.","['Messod D. Beneish', 'Cassandra D.

"Information percolation, momentum and reversal","We propose a joint theory of time-series momentum and reversal based on a rational-expectations model. We show that a necessary condition for momentum to arise in this framework is that information flows at an increasing rate. We focus on word-of-mouth communication as a mechanism that enforces this condition and generates short-term momentum and long-term reversal. Investors with heterogeneous trading strategies—contrarian and momentum traders—coexist in the marketplace. Although a significant proportion of investors are momentum traders, momentum is not completely eliminated. Word-of-mouth communication spreads rumors and generates price run-ups and reversals.

"Firm characteristics, consumption risk, and firm-level risk exposures","We propose a novel approach to measuring firm-level risk exposures and costs of equity. Using a simple consumption-based asset pricing model that explains nearly two-thirds of the variation in average returns across 55 anomaly portfolios, we map the relation between exposures to consumption risk and portfolio-level characteristics. We use this relation to calculate exposures to consumption risk at the firm level and show that the calculated consumption risk exposures yield portfolios with large differences in average returns and ex post consumption risk exposures consistent with those predicted by our calculated betas. Further, industry betas and risk premia implied by our procedure display economically intuitive variation over time. Finally, Fama-MacBeth regressions suggest that risk exposures calculated using our procedure dominate those from alternative factor models at explaining cross-sectional variation in returns.","['Robert F.

Endogenous intermediation in over-the-counter markets,"We provide a theory of trading through intermediaries in over-the-counter markets. The role of intermediaries is to sustain trade. In our model, traders are connected through an informational network. Agents observe their neighbors’ actions and can trade with their counterparty in a given period through a path of intermediaries in the network. Nevertheless, agents can renege on their obligations. We show that trading through an informational network is essential to support trade when agents infrequently meet the same counteparty. However, intermediaries must receive fees to implement trades.

Variance risk premiums and the forward premium puzzle,"We provide new empirical evidence that world currency and U.S. stock variance risk premiums have nonredundant and significant predictive power for the appreciation rates of 22 with respect to the U.S. dollar, especially at the four-month and one-month horizons, respectively. The heterogeneous exposures of currencies to the currency variance risk premium are systematically rising along the line of inflation risk. We rationalize these findings in a consumption-based asset pricing model, with local consumption uncertainty and global inflation uncertainty characterized, respectively, by the stock and currency variance risk premiums.","['Juan M.

It pays to write well,"We quantify the effects of easy-to-read disclosure documents on firm value by analyzing shareholder reports of closed-end investment companies in which the company's value can be estimated separately from the value of the company's underlying assets. Using a copy-editing software application that counts the pervasiveness of the most important ‘writing faults’ that make a document harder to read, our analysis provides evidence that issuing financial disclosure documents with low readability causes firms to trade at significant discounts relative to the value of their fundamentals. Our estimates suggest that a one-standard-deviation decrease in readability decreases firm value by a full 2.5%. In situations in which investors are more likely to rely on annual reports, the readability effect on firm value increases to 3.3%.","['Byoung-Hyoun Hwang', 'Hugh Hoikwang Kim']","['Disclosure characteristics', 'Readability', 'Firm value']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300193,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,124,2
Merger activity in industry equilibrium,"We quantify the impact of merger activity on productive efficiency. We develop and calibrate a dynamic industry-equilibrium model that features mergers, entry, and exit by heterogeneous firms. Mergers affect productivity directly through realized synergies, and indirectly through firms’ incentives to enter or exit the industry. Merger activity increases average firm productivity by 4.8%, of which 4.1% reflects the accumulation of synergies, and 0.7% the interaction between merger options and firms’ entry and exit decisions. We show that ignoring the implications of merger activity for public policies that promote entry can reverse the expected impact of these policies on productivity.","['Theodosios Dimopoulos', 'Stefano Sacchetto']","['Mergers', 'Entry', 'Exit', 'Industry equilibrium']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301319,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,1
Uncovering expected returns: Information in analyst coverage proxies,"We show that analyst coverage proxies contain information about expected returns. We decompose analyst coverage into abnormal and expected components using a simple characteristic-based model and show that firms with abnormally high analyst coverage subsequently outperform firms with abnormally low coverage by approximately 80 basis points per month. We also show abnormal coverage rises following exogenous shocks to underpricing and predicts improvements in firms’ fundamental performance, suggesting that return predictability stems from analysts more heavily covering underpriced stocks. Our findings highlight the usefulness of analysts’ actions in expected return estimations, and a potential inference problem when coverage proxies are used to study information asymmetry and dissemination.","['Charles M.C.

The impact of firm prestige on executive compensation,"We show that chief executive officers (CEOs) of prestigious firms earn less. Total compensation is on average 8% lower for firms listed in Fortune’s ranking of America’s most admired companies. We suggest that CEOs are willing to trade off status and career benefits from working for a publicly admired company against additional monetary compensation. Our identification strategy is based on matched sample analyses, difference-in-differences regressions, and a regression discontinuity design. We perform several robustness checks and exclude many alternative explanations, including that firm prestige just proxies for better corporate governance or for increased exposure of the pay-setting process to media attention.","['Florens Focke', 'Ernst Maug', 'Alexandra Niessen-Ruenzi']","['CEO compensation', 'Firm prestige', 'Social status', 'Career benefits']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301799,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,2
Opportunism as a firm and managerial trait: Predicting insider trading profits and misconduct,"We show that opportunistic insiders can be identified through the profitability of their trades prior to quarterly earnings announcements (QEAs) and that opportunistic trading is associated with various kinds of firm or managerial misconduct. A value-weighted trading strategy based on (not necessarily pre-QEA) trades of opportunistic insiders earns monthly four-factor alphas of over 1%, which is much higher than in past insider trading literature and substantial and significant even on the short side. Firms with opportunistic insiders have higher levels of earnings management, restatements, US Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions, shareholder litigation, and executive compensation. These findings suggest that opportunism is a domain-general trait.","['Usman Ali', 'David Hirshleifer']","['Insider trading', 'Opportunistic behavior', 'Firm and insider misconduct']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302349,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,3
International correlation risk,"We show that the cross-sectional dispersion of conditional foreign exchange (FX) correlation is countercyclical and that currencies that perform badly (well) during periods of high dispersion yield high (low) average excess returns. We also find a negative cross-sectional association between average FX correlations and average option-implied FX correlation risk premiums. Our findings show that while investors in spot currency markets require a positive risk premium for exposure to high dispersion states, FX option prices are consistent with investors being compensated for the risk of low dispersion states. To address our empirical findings, we propose a no-arbitrage model that features unspanned FX correlation risk.","['Philippe Mueller', 'Andreas Stathopoulos', 'Andrea Vedolin']","['Correlation risk', 'Exchange rates', 'International finance']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302155,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,2
"Dark pool trading strategies, market quality and welfare","We show that when a continuous dark pool is added to a limit order book that opens illiquid, book and consolidated fill rates and volume increase, but spread widens, depth declines, and welfare deteriorates. The adverse effects on market quality and welfare are mitigated when book-liquidity builds but so are the positive effects on trading activity. All effects are stronger when traders’ valuations are less dispersed, access to the dark pool is greater, horizon is longer, and relative tick size larger.","['Sabrina Buti', 'Barbara Rindi', 'Ingrid M.

Ambiguity and the corporation: Group disagreement and underinvestment,"We study a dynamic corporate investment problem where decisions have to be made collectively by a group of agents holding heterogeneous beliefs and adhering to a “utilitarian” governance mechanism in which each agent has a given influence in the decision. In this setting we show that: (i) group decisions are typically dynamically inconsistent, (ii) dynamic inconsistency leads to inefficient underinvestment, and (iii) the ability to trade securities among insiders or with outsiders may restore efficient investment decisions but it may, in some cases, lead to inefficient overinvestment. Our theory can help explain the empirical evidence on the effect of diversity of groups, such as corporate boards, on firms’ outcomes and, more generally, on the difference between group and individual behavior.","['Lorenzo Garlappi', 'Ron Giammarino', 'Ali Lazrak']","['Ambiguity', 'Group decisions', 'Dynamic consistency', 'Dynamic real investment', 'Security issuance']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301228,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,3
Systemic risk in clearing houses: Evidence from the European repo market,"We study how crises affect Central Clearing Counterparties (CCPs). We focus on a large and safe segment of the CCP-cleared repo market during the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. We develop a simple model to infer CCP stress, which is measured as repo rates’ sensitivity to sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) spreads and jointly captures (1) the effectiveness of haircut policies, (2) CCP-member default risk (conditional on sovereign default), and (3) CCP default risk (conditional on both sovereign and CCP-member default). During 2011, repo rates strongly respond to sovereign risk, particularly for Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS): Repo investors behaved as if the conditional probability of CCP default was substantial.","['Charles Boissel', 'François Derrien', 'Evren Ors', 'David Thesmar']","['Repurchase agreement', 'Sovereign debt crisis', 'LTRO', 'Secured money market lending', 'Clearing houses']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301277,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,3
"Information disclosure, firm growth, and the cost of capital","We study how information disclosure affects the cost of equity capital and investor welfare in a dynamic setting. We show that a firm’s cost of capital decreases (increases) in the precision of public disclosure if the firm’s growth rate is below (above) a certain threshold. The threshold growth rate is higher when the firm’s cash flows are more persistent, or when other firms in the economy are growing at low rates. While current shareholders always prefer maximum public disclosure, future shareholders’ welfare decreases (increases) in the precision of public disclosure if the firm’s growth rate is below (above) the threshold.","['Sunil Dutta', 'Alexander Nezlobin']","['Cost of capital', 'Information disclosure', 'Risk premium', 'Growth']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301982,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,2
Do managers overreact to salient risks? Evidence from hurricane strikes,"We study how managers respond to hurricane events when their firms are located in the neighborhood of the disaster area. We find that the sudden shock to the perceived liquidity risk leads managers to increase corporate cash holdings and to express more concerns about hurricane risk in 10-Ks/10-Qs, even though the actual risk remains unchanged. Both effects are temporary. Over time, the perceived risk decreases, and the bias disappears. The distortion between perceived and actual risk is large, and the increase in cash is suboptimal. Overall, managerial reaction to hurricanes is consistent with salience theories of choice.","['Olivier Dessaint', 'Adrien Matray']","['Behavioral bias', 'Risk perception', 'Corporate cash holdings', 'Availability heuristic', 'Risk management']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17301496,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,1
Customer concentration and loan contract terms,"We study pricing and non-pricing features of loan contracts to gauge how the credit market evaluates a firm’s customer-base profile and supply-chain relations. Higher customer concentration increases interest rate spreads and the number of restrictive covenants featured in newly initiated as well as renegotiated bank loans. Customer concentration also abbreviates the maturity of those loans as well as the relationship between firms and their banks. These effects are intensified by customers’ financial distress, the level of relationship-specific investments, and the use of trade credit in customer–supplier relations. Our evidence shows that a deeper exposure to a small set of large customers bears negative consequences for a firm’s relations with its creditors, revealing limits to integration along the supply chain.","['Murillo Campello', 'Janet Gao']","['Customer concentration', 'Bank loans', 'Contract terms', 'Financial distress', 'Instrumental variables']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16301738,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,1
The effects of removing barriers to equity issuance,"We study the consequences of a US deregulation allowing small firms to accelerate their public equity issuance. Post-deregulation, affected firms double their reliance on public equity and transition away from private investments in public equity compared to similar untreated firms. The net effect is a 5.7 percentage point or 49% increase in the annual probability of raising equity. This is accompanied by a reduction in equity issuance costs, an increase in investment, and a decrease in leverage. Our findings provide evidence that reducing equity issuance barriers benefits issuers even in highly developed markets.","['Matthew T.

The unintended consequences of the zero lower bound policy,"We study the impact of the zero lower bound interest rate policy on the industrial organization of the U.S. money fund industry. We find that in response to policies that maintain low interest rates, money funds: change their product offerings by investing in riskier asset classes; are more likely to exit the market; and reduce the fees they charge their investors. The consequence of fund closures resulting from interest rate policy is the relocation of resources in affected fund families and in the asset management industry in general, as well as decline in capital of issuers borrowing from money funds.","['Marco Di Maggio', 'Marcin Kacperczyk']","['Unconventional monetary policy', 'Money funds', 'Risk taking', 'Fund exit']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1630157X,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,1
Explaining the negative returns to volatility claims: An equilibrium approach,"We study the returns to investing in VIX futures, VIX Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), and variance swaps. We document substantial negative return premia for these assets. For example, the constant maturity portfolio of 1-month VIX futures loses about 30% per year over our sample period (2006–2013). We investigate if these findings are consistent with dynamic equilibrium. We derive a model based on present value computation that endogenizes stock prices, the VIX index, and its associated derivative contracts. The model explains the negative return premia as well as several other stylized features of the VIX futures, ETNs, and variance swap data.","['Bjørn Eraker', 'Yue Wu']","['Variance risk premium', 'VIX futures', 'VIX ETN', 'Dynamic equilibrium', 'Jump-diffusion']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17300764,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,125,1
The term structure of returns: Facts and theory,"We summarize and extend the new literature on the term structure of equity. Short-term equity claims, or dividend strips, have higher average returns and Sharpe ratios than the aggregate stock market. The returns on short-term dividend claims are risky as measured by volatility, but safe as measured by market beta. These facts are hard to reconcile with traditional macro-finance models and we provide an overview of new models that can reproduce some of these facts. We relate our evidence on dividend strips to facts about other asset classes such as nominal and corporate bonds, volatility, and housing. We discuss the broader economic implications of our findings by linking the term structure of returns to real economic decisions such as hiring and investment. We conclude with an outline of empirical and theoretical extensions that we consider interesting avenues for future research.","['Jules H. van Binsbergen', 'Ralph S.J.

Offshore schemes and tax evasion: The role of banks,"We use mandatory Russian banks’ reports to the Central Bank to construct a novel measure of offshore-banking. Individual bank involvement in offshore operations is calculated as a fraction of total transactions with foreign countries that go through offshore financial centers. We find that offshore-active banks perform less financial intermediation and focus more on international wire transfers. We show a positive relation between banks’ offshore activities and tax evasion of companies doing business through these banks. Finally, we show that the Central Bank eventually responds to this behavior: offshore-active banks have higher likelihood of license revocation and criminal investigation against top-management.","['Lucy Chernykh', 'Sergey Mityakov']","['Financial institutions', 'Offshore banking', 'Tax evasion']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X17302362,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,126,3
"Option repricing, corporate governance, and the effect of shareholder empowerment","We use the practice of employee option repricing to investigate how shareholder involvement in firm compensation policies affects the quality of firm governance. We find that a 2003 reform that empowered shareholders to approve or reject repricing proposals led to value increases in previous repricers. The likelihood of repricing becomes less sensitive to poor manager performance, but remains similarly sensitive to bad luck, after the reform. Average post-repricing changes in firm performance are positive only after the reform. Overall, our results suggest that shareholder empowerment improves the governance of repricing and can transform repricing into a value-creating tool.","['Huseyin Gulen', ""William J.

Diversification and cash dynamics,"Why do diversified firms hold significantly less cash than focused firms? We study this question using a dynamic model of corporate investment, saving, and diversification decisions. We find that investment dynamics are more important in explaining the cash differences than financing frictions. More efficient internal capital markets increase cash differences and are especially valuable when a firm diversifies or refocuses. Contrary to static models, more diverse conglomerates have lower cash differences. Endogenous selection (diversifying firms are larger and have better growth opportunities) accounts for 68% of the cash difference, and the diversification event itself reduces cash holdings by 32%.","['Tor-Erik Bakke', 'Tiantian Gu']","['Diversification', 'Organizational structure', 'Corporate saving', 'Internal capital markets', 'Investment']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X16302410,Journal of Financial Economics,2017,123,3
Rollover risk as market discipline: A two-sided inefficiency,"Why does the market discipline that financial intermediaries face seem too weak during booms and too strong during crises? This paper shows in a general equilibrium setting that rollover risk as a disciplining device is effective only if all intermediaries face purely idiosyncratic risk. However, if assets are correlated, a two-sided inefficiency arises: Good aggregate states have intermediaries taking excessive risks, while bad aggregate states suffer from costly fire sales. The driving force behind this inefficiency is an amplifying feedback loop between asset values and market discipline. In equilibrium, financial intermediaries inefficiently amplify both positive and negative aggregate shocks.",['Thomas M.
