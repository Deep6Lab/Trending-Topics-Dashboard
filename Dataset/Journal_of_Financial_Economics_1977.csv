On the pricing of contingent claims and the Modigliani-Miller theorem,"A general formula is derived for the price of a security whose value under specified conditions is a known function of the value of another security. Although the formula can be derived using the arbitrage technique of Black and Scholes, the alternative approach of continuous-time portfolio strategies is used instead. This alternative derivation allows the resolution of some controversies surrounding the Black and Scholes methodology. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the derived pricing formula must be continuous with continuous first derivatives, and that there is not a ‘pre-selection bias’ in the choice of independent variables used in the formula. Finally, the alternative derivation provides a direct proof of the Modigliani-Miller theorem even when there is a positive probability of bankruptcy.",['Robert C.

Efficient portfolio choice with differential taxation of dividends and capital gains,"A simple, necessary and sufficient condition is derived under which portfolios that are mean-variance efficient on a before-tax basis are also efficient on an after-tax basis and vice-versa. Under this condition and the hypothesis that investors demand after-tax efficient portfolios, the ‘no-tax’ form of the Capital Asset Pricing Model provides an accurate description of equilibrium asset returns even though investors in the economy may be subject to a wide variety of tax rates on dividends and capital gains. Evidence reported by Black and Scholes (1974), however, makes the condition for equivalence of before and after-tax efficiency empirically implausible. The paper thus concludes with a characterization of some essential differences between before and after-tax efficient portfolios and of the after-tax efficiency losses associated with before-tax efficient portfolios. The relation of these results to the issue of corporate dividend policy choices is also discussed.",['John B.

The structure and management of dual purpose funds,"Dual fund shares allow individuals to satisfy their divergent preferences for the ordinary income and the capital gains components of return. Institutional restrictions on short selling are shown to permit discounts on dual funds to fluctuate within wide bounds. However, these fluctuations are shown to be consistent with informational efficiency. The average discount is shown to have a contemporaneous association with net redemptions of diversified open-end funds. It is shown that the high turnover of dual fund portfolios is not warranted by their portfolio performance and causes redistributions of wealth between income and capital shareholders.","['Robert H Litzenberger', 'Howard B Sosin']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X77900113,Journal of Financial Economics,1977,4,2
"Bankruptcy, absolute priority, and the pricing of risky debt claims","In practice, there are substantial deviations from the doctrine of ‘absolute priority’, which governs the rights of the firm's claimholders in the event of bankruptcy. To determine whether or not the possibility of such deviations is reflected in the prices of the firm's securities, this study examines the risk and return characteristics of financial claims against firms in court-supervised bankruptcy proceedings. Debt claims against bankrupt firms are indeed ‘risky’, exhibiting levels of systematic risk similar to that of common stocks in general. While some of the findings are anomalous, the data are generally consistent with the view that the capital market ‘properly’ prices risky debt claims to reflect both their risk characteristics and the possibility of departures from the doctrine of absolute priority.",['Jerold B.

"Trading rules, large blocks and the speed of price adjustment",In this paper large block stock transactions are examined in the context of a trading rule devised by Grier and Albin. The study makes use of the actual intra-day history of stock transactions. Considerable effort is taken to correctly incorporate the effects of transaction costs on trading rule profits and evidence is presented on the sensitivity of such profits to variations in these costs. The use of intra-day prices yields results consistent with the weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis and provides important evidence on the speed of price adjustment.,"['Larry Y.

Capital market equilibrium in a mean-lower partial moment framework,"In this paper, we develop a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using a mean-lower partial moment framework. We explicitly derive formulae for the equilibrium values of risky assets that hold for arbitrary probability distributions. We show that when the probability distributions and portfolio returns are either normal, stable (with the same characteristic exponent between 1 and 2 and the same skewness parameter, not necessarily zero), or Student-t distributions, our CAPM reduces to the traditional mean-scale CAPM's. Consequently, since the traditional equilibrium models are special cases of our model, the mean-lower partial moment framework is guaranteed to do at least as well in explaining market data. As an application of our theory, we derive an acceptance criterion for capital investment projects and note that corporate finance theory results developed, for example, in the well-known mean- variance framework carry over to the mean-lower partial moment framework.","['Vijay S.

Determinants of corporate borrowing,"Many corporate assets, particularly growth opportunities, can be viewed as call options. The value of such ‘real options’ depends on discretionary future investment by the firm. Issuing risky debt reduces the present market value of a firm holding real options by inducing a suboptimal investment strategy or by forcing the firm and its creditors to bear the costs of avoiding the suboptimal strategy. The paper predicts that corporate borrowing is inversely related to the proportion of market value accounted for by real options. It also rationalizes other aspects of corporate borrowing behavior, for example the practice of matching maturities of assets and debt liabilities.",['Stewart C.

Stock exchange seats as capital assets,"Stock exchange seats are important assets for securities brokers since they provide access to centralized secondary trading markets for corporate securities at a reduced cost. This paper provides empirical evidence on the dynamic behavior of monthly New York and American Stock Exchange seat prices over the 1926–1972 period. Specifically, evidence is presented which: (a) is consistent with a multiplicative random walk model for seat prices; (b) indicates that unexpected changes in the prices of exchange-listed stocks or in the volume of shares traded on the exchange are important new information about the value of seats in each month; and (c) indicates that the market for seats is efficient in assimilating new information and quickly incorporates new information into the prices of seats.

A critique of the asset pricing theory's tests Part I: On past and potential testability of the theory,"Testing the two-parameter asset pricing theory is difficult (and currently infeasible). Due to a mathematical equivalence between the individual return/‘beta’ linearity relation and the market portfolio's mean-variance efficiency, any valid test presupposes complete knowledge of the true market portfolio's composition. This implies, inter alia, that every individual asset must be included in a correct test. Errors of inference inducible by incomplete tests are discussed and some ambiguities in published tests are explained.",['Richard Roll'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X77900095,Journal of Financial Economics,1977,4,2
Long-term dependence in common stock returns,"The efficient market, martingale model of security price movements requires that the arrival of new information be promptly arbitraged away. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an arbitraged price is that statistical dependence among prices must decrease very rapidly. If persistent statistical dependence is present, the arbitraged price changes do not follow a martingale and should have an infinite variance. Using a technique for detecting long-term dependence, called R/S analysis, 200 daily stock return series are studied; many series are characterized by long-term dependence. Thus, in the presence of long-term dependence, the martingale model does not hold. Also, the distribution of security returns is non-normal stable Paretian as opposed to Gaussian.","['Myron T.

The valuation of warrants: Implementing a new approach,"The option pricing model developed by Black and Scholes and extended by Merton gives rise to partial differential equations governing the value of an option. When the underlying stock pays no dividends – and in some very restrictive cases when it does – a closed form solution to the differential equation subject to the appropriate boundary conditions, has been obtained. But, in some relevant cases such as the one in which the stock pays discrete dividends, no closed form solution has been found. This paper shows how to solve these equations by numerical methods. In addition, the optimal strategy for exercising American options is derived. A numerical illustration of the procedure is also presented.",['Eduardo S.

An equilibrium characterization of the term structure,"The paper derives a general form of the term structure of interest rates. The following assumptions are made: (A.1) The instantaneous (spot) interest rate follows a diffusion process; (A.2) the price of a discount bond depends only on the spot rate over its term; and (A.3) the market is efficient. Under these assumptions, it is shown by means of an arbitrage argument that the expected rate of return on any bond in excess of the spot rate is proportional to its standard deviation. This property is then used to derive a partial differential equation for bond prices. The solution to that equation is given in the form of a stochastic integral representation. An interpretation of the bond pricing formula is provided. The model is illustrated on a specific case.",['Oldrich Vasicek'],[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X77900162,Journal of Financial Economics,1977,5,2
Portfolio strategies and performance,"The relative performance of several portfolio selection strategies is assessed empirically. These strategies vary in sophistication from a ‘naive’ strategy of maintaining equal dollar investments in each stock available to a strategy that periodically uses updated parameter estimates to calculate new optimal proportions of portfolio value to be invested in the stocks available. Although it is to be expected a priori that relatively sophisticated strategies will perform at least as well as the more naive strategies, implementation costs will clearly differ across strategies and across investor-specific parameters such as total portfolio value. Thus estimation of the various strategies' performance gross of these costs is a necessary consideration in rational strategy selection by any given investor.","['Ted Bloomfield', 'Richard Leftwich', 'John B.

The impact of maturity regulation on high interest rate lenders and borrowers,"The State of Maine recently imposed an additional regulation on the maturity of small loans offered by finance companies, presumably to protect the consumer. The effectively restricted the maturity of these high interest rate loans to 36 months. Within five years, the number of licensees (finance company offices) declined from 116 to 24. Within another five years, all of these lenders had completely ceased operations. Hypotheses on the effect and value to consumers of the regulation are stated operationally and tested empirically. This study includes estimation of the loan companies' cost function, (accounting) profit rates and output and a survey of the individuals directly affected by the demise of the companies. The analysis indicates (1) that the maturity restriction made ordinary operations unprofitable, (2) why this occurred, and (3) that half of the consumers did not obtain funds elsewhere.",['George J.

The effect of limited information and estimation risk on optimal portfolio diversification,"This paper analyzes the optimal portfolio choice problem when security returns have a joint multivariate normal distribution with unknown parameters. For the case of limited, but sufficient (sample plus prior) information, we show that for a general family of conjugate priors, the optimal portfolio choice is obtained by the use of a mean-variance analysis that differs from traditional mean-variance analysis due to estimation risk. We also consider two illustrative cases of insufficient sample information and minimal prior information and show that in these cases it is asymptotically optimal for an investor to limit diversification to a subset of the securities. These theoretical results corroborate observed investor behavior in capital markets.","['Roger W. Klein', 'Vijay S.

Portfolio choice and equilibrium in capital markets with safety-first investors,"This paper develops optimal portfolio choice and market equilibrium when investors behave according to a generalized lexicographic safety-first rule. We show that the mutual fund separation property holds for the optimal portfolio choice of a risk-averse safety-first investor. We also derive an explicit valuation formula for the equilibrium value of assets. The valuation formula reduces to the well-known two-parameter capital asset pricing model (CAPM) when investors approximate the tail of the portfolio distribution using Tchebychev's inequality or when the assets have normal or stable Paretian distributions. This shows the robustness of the CAPM to safety-first investors under traditional distributional assumptions. In addition, we indicate how additional information about the portfolio distribution can be incorporated to the safety-first valuation formula to obtain alternative empirically testable models.","['Enrique R.

Then the complementary pivot algorithm of Lemke (1965), which has been shown to be capable of deriving the optimal solution to certain quadratic programming problems that are subject to a non-negativity constraint, is described. Finally, Lemke's algorithm is shown to be capable of deriving the minimum-variance zero-beta portfolio efficiently from samples of risky assets where both long and short positions are allowed by reformulating the problem so as to avoid the difficulties encountered by having a non-negatively constraint.",['Gordon J.

No evidence is found for a liquidity premium on forward exchange, indicating that the forward rate can be used as a proxy of the market's expectations and that open exchange positions involve little systematic risk. It is also shown that forward exhange is priced as if the exchange rate could be characterized by a diffusion process with a trend, although there is some evidence such a process does not adequately characterize the exchange rate in all cases.",['Bradford Cornell'],[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X77900290,Journal of Financial Economics,1977,5,1
Human capital and capital market equilibrium,"This paper finds that extending popular two-parameter models of capital market equilibrium to allow for the existence of non-marketable human capital does not provide better empirical descriptions of the expected return-risk relationship for marketable securities than those that come out of the simpler models. This conclusion arises from the fact that relationships between the return on human capital and the returns on various marketable assets are weak, so that the model that includes human capital leads to estimates of risk for marketable assets indistinguishable from those of the simpler models.","['Eugene F.

Risk-adjusted discount rates and capital budgeting under uncertainty,"This paper is concerned with the valuation of multiperiod cash flows in a world where prices are determined according to the Sharpe-Lintner-Black model of capital market equilibrium. We find that the current market value of any future net cash flow is the current expected value of the flow discounted at risk-adjusted discount rates for each of the periods until the flow is realized. The discount rates are known and non-stochastic, but the rates for the different periods preceding the realization of a cash flow need not to be the same, and the rates relevant for a given period can differ across cash flows. The risk adjustments in the discount rates arise because of uncertainties about reassessments through time of the expected value of a flow and the relationships between these reassessments and the corresponding reassessments of the expected cash flows of all firms.",['Eugene F.

Alternative methods for raising capital,"This paper provides an analysis of the choice of method for raising additional equity capital by listed firms. Examination of expenses reported to the SEC indicates that rights offerings involve significantly lower costs; yet underwriter are employed in over 90 percent of the offerings. The underwriting industry, finance textbooks, and corporate proxy statements offer several justifications for the use of underwriters. However, estimates of the magnitudes of these arguments indicate that they are insufficient to justify the additional costs of the use of underwriters. The use of underwriters thus appears to be inconsistent with rational, wealth-maximizing behavior by the owners of the firm.

The impact of the tender offer on the returns to stockholders of both bidding and target firms is examined. The evidence indicates that for the twelve months prior to the tender offer stockholders of bidding firms earn significant positive abnormal returns. In the month of the offer, only successful bidders earn significant positive abnormal returns. Stockholders of both successful and unsuccessful targe firms earn large positive abnormal returns from tender offers, and most of these returns occur in the month of the offer. For all classes of firms, there is no significant post-offer market reaction. The market reaction to ‘clean-up’ tender offers is also estimated and target stockholders again earn significant positive abnormal returns.","['Peter Dodd', 'Richard Ruback']",[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X77900435,Journal of Financial Economics,1977,5,3
