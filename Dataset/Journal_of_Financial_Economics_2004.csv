The value of dividend imputation tax credits in Australia,"A dividend imputation tax system provides shareholders with a credit (for corporate tax paid) that can be used to offset personal tax on dividend income. This paper shows how to infer the value of imputation tax credits from the prices of derivative securities that are unique to Australian retail markets. We also test whether a tax law amendment that was designed to prevent the trading of imputation credits affected their economic value. Before the amendment, tax credits were worth up to 50% of face value in large, high-yielding companies, but subsequently it is difficult to detect any value at all.","['Damien Cannavan', 'Frank Finn', 'Stephen Gray']","['Dividend imputation', 'Cost of capital']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002381,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,1
"Earnings management, stock issues, and shareholder lawsuits","Abnormal accounting accruals are unusually high around stock offers, especially high for firms whose offers subsequently attract lawsuits. Accruals tend to reverse after stock offers and are negatively related to post-offer stock returns. Reversals are more pronounced and stock returns are lower for sued firms than for those that are not sued. The incidence of lawsuits involving stock offers and settlement amounts are significantly positively related to abnormal accruals around the offer and significantly negatively related to post-offer stock returns. Our results support the view that some firms opportunistically manipulate earnings upward before stock issues rendering themselves vulnerable to litigation.","['Larry L DuCharme', 'Paul H Malatesta', 'Stephan E Sefcik']","['Earnings management', 'Stock offers', 'Shareholder lawsuits', 'IPOs', 'SEOs']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0300182X,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,1
Are dividends disappearing? Dividend concentration and the consolidation of earnings,"Aggregate real dividends paid by industrial firms increased over the past two decades even though, as Fama and French (J. Financial Econ. 60, 3) (2001a) document, the number of dividend payers decreased by over 50%. The reason is that (i) the reduction in payers occurs almost entirely among firms that paid very small dividends, and (ii) increased real dividends from the top payers swamp the modest dividend reduction from the loss of many small payers. These trends reflect high and increasing concentration in the supply of dividends which, in turn, reflects high and increasing earnings concentration. For example, the 25 firms that paid the largest dividends in 2000 account for a majority of the aggregate dividends and earnings of industrial firms. Industrial firms exhibit a two-tier structure in which a small number of firms with very high earnings collectively generates the majority of earnings and dominates the dividend supply, while the vast majority of firms has at best a modest collective impact on aggregate earnings and dividends.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Douglas J Skinner']","['Dividends', 'Payout policy', 'Earnings concentration', 'Losses']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001867,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,3
Data-generating process uncertainty: What difference does it make in portfolio decisions?,"As the usual normality assumption is firmly rejected by the data, investors encounter a data-generating process (DGP) uncertainty in making investment decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel way to incorporate uncertainty about the DGP into portfolio analysis. We find that accounting for fat tails leads to nontrivial changes in both parameter estimates and optimal portfolio weights, but the certainty–equivalent losses associated with ignoring fat tails are small. This suggests that the normality assumption works well in evaluating portfolio performance for a mean-variance investor.","['Jun Tu', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Asset pricing tests: Investments', 'Data generating process', 't distribution', 'Bayesian analysis']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002472,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,2
Why are foreign firms listed in the U.S. worth more?,"At the end of 1997, foreign companies with shares cross-listed in the U.S. had Tobin's q ratios that were 16.5% higher than the q ratios of non-cross-listed firms from the same country. The valuation difference is statistically significant and reaches 37% for those companies that list on major U.S. exchanges, even after controlling for a number of firm and country characteristics. We suggest that a U.S. listing reduces the extent to which controlling shareholders can engage in expropriation and thereby increases the firm's ability to take advantage of growth opportunities. We show that growth opportunities are more highly valued for firms that choose to cross-list in the U.S., particularly those from countries with poorer investor rights.","['Craig Doidge', 'G.Andrew Karolyi', 'René M Stulz']","['International cross-listings', 'Valuation', 'Controlling shareholders', 'Governance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001831,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,2
"Tick size, NYSE rule 118, and ex-dividend day stock price behavior","Bali and Hite (1998) and Dubofsky (1992) propose models in which market microstructure effects play a role in the ex-dividend day price drop anomaly. Bali and Hite suggest that the anomaly is caused solely by price discreteness, while Dubofsky suggests that NYSE Rule 118 is also involved. We test these models by examining cum- to ex-day price drops during the one-eighth, one-sixteenth, and decimal tick size regimes. While the evidence is qualitatively consistent with Dubofsky's predictions, neither model is satisfactory in a quantitative sense. One of our main empirical findings is that no significant decline was evident in the magnitude of the ex-day anomaly after the tick size reduction.","['Keith Jakob', 'Tongshu Ma']","['Ex-dividend day price drop', 'Tick size', 'NYSE Rule 118']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001892,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,3
Corporate earnings and the equity premium,"Corporate cash flows are highly volatile and strongly procyclical. We examine the asset-pricing implications of the sensitivity of corporate cash flows to economic shocks within a continuous-time model in which dividends are a stochastic fraction of aggregate consumption. We provide closed-form solutions for stock values and show that the equity premium can be represented as the sum of three components which we call the consumption-risk, event-risk, and corporate-risk premia. Calibrated to historical data, the model implies a total equity premium many times larger than in the standard model. The model also generates levels of equity volatility consistent with those experienced in the stock market.","['Francis A.

Order preferencing and market quality on NASDAQ before and after decimalization,"Despite the widely held belief that order preferencing affects market quality, no hard evidence exists on the extent and determinants of order preferencing and its impact on dealer competition and execution quality. This study shows that the bid-ask spread (dealer quote aggressiveness) is positively (negatively) related to the proportion of internalized volume during both the pre- and post-decimalization periods. Although decimal pricing led to lower order preferencing on NASDAQ, the extent of order preferencing after decimalization is higher than what prior studies had predicted. The price impact of preferenced trades is smaller than that of unpreferenced trades and preferenced trades receive greater (smaller) size (price) improvements than unpreferenced trades.","['Kee H Chung', 'Chairat Chuwonganant', 'D.Timothy McCormick']","['Decimalization', 'Internalization', 'Payment for order flow', 'Quote aggressiveness', 'Spreads', 'Execution quality']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001740,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,3
Corporate governance and firm value: evidence from the Korean financial crisis,"During the 1997 Korean financial crisis, firms with higher ownership concentration by unaffiliated foreign investors experienced a smaller reduction in their share value. Firms that had higher disclosure quality and alternative sources of external financing also suffered less. In contrast, chaebol firms with concentrated ownership by controlling family shareholders experienced a larger drop in the value of their equity. Firms in which the controlling shareholders’ voting rights exceeded cash flow rights and those who borrowed more from the main banks also had lower returns. Our results suggest that change in firm value during a crisis is a function of firm-level differences in corporate governance measures.","['Jae-Seung Baek', 'Jun-Koo Kang', 'Kyung Suh Park']","['Corporate governance', 'Firm value', 'Chaebol', 'Controlling shareholder', 'Main bank']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001673,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,2
Common market makers and commonality in liquidity,"Each NYSE specialist firm provides liquidity for more than one common stock. As a result of shared capital and information among specialists within a firm, we argue that stock liquidity will co-move with the liquidity of other stocks handled by the same specialist firm, with magnitude increasing with the risk of providing liquidity. The evidence indicates that individual stock liquidity co-varies with specialist portfolio liquidity apart from information reflected by market liquidity variation. Further tests based on specialist firm size, specialist firm mergers, and market returns indicate that liquidity co-variation increases with the risk of providing liquidity.","['Jay F.

Tax-loss trading and wash sales,"Finnish investors realize losses more than gains toward the end of December. Moreover, they repurchase the same stocks recently sold. The repurchase rate depends on loss magnitude, firm size, and how late in the year the sale takes place. This trading pattern generates net tax-loss buying pressure that is negative prior to the turn of the year and positive afterward. Cross-sectional regressions indicate that stock returns around the turn of the year, particularly for small firms, are related to net tax-loss buying pressure but not to firm size per se.","['Mark Grinblatt', 'Matti Keloharju']","['January effect', 'Tax-loss selling', 'Wash sales', 'Empirical anomalies', 'Stock returns']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001806,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,1
Asset prices and real investment,"Firm investment activity and firm characteristics, particularly the market-to-book ratio or q, are functions of the state of the economy and therefore contain information about the dynamic behavior of stock returns. This paper develops a model of a production economy in which real investment is irreversible and subject to convex adjustment costs. During low-q (high-q) periods when the irreversibility constraint (constraint on the rate of investment) is binding, conditional volatility and expected returns on one hand, and market-to-book ratios on the other, should be negatively (positively) related. Empirical tests based on industry portfolios support these predictions for conditional volatility but not for expected returns.",['Leonid Kogan'],"['Investment', 'Irreversibility', 'General equilibrium', 'Leverage effect', 'Book-to-market']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000959,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,3
Death spiral convertibles,"Floating-priced convertibles, known as death spirals, are privately held convertible securities with a conversion price set at a discount from the average of past stock prices in a look-back period. The issuance of floating-priced convertibles is followed by significant negative abnormal returns. The results are consistent with the faulty contract hypothesis that argues that the contract design encourages short-selling by the convertible holders and other professional short sellers. However, the results are also consistent with the last-resort financing hypothesis that argues that the stock price declines because the stock is overvalued at the time of the issue.","['Pierre Hillion', 'Theo Vermaelen']","['Convertibles', 'Financial innovation', 'Anomalies', 'Capital structure', 'Manipulation', 'Short-selling']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002095,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,2
A revealed preference approach to understanding corporate governance problems: Evidence from Canada,"Governance problems have a direct and immediate impact on the effective discount rate guiding investment decisions. Information from a transformed net present value rule and variation in firm-level panel data “reveal” the effective discount rate influencing investment. For the firms most likely to be affected by Jensen agency problems, investment behavior appears to be guided by discount rates less than the market rate by 350–400 basis points. This wedge is reduced for firms with a concentrated ownership structure. Firms facing free cash flow problems have a stock of fixed capital approximately 7–22% higher than would prevail under value maximizing behavior.","['Robert S.

Earnings management and the market performance of acquiring firms,"I examine the market's efficiency in processing manipulated accounting reports and provide an explanation for the post-merger underperformance anomaly. I find strong evidence suggesting that acquiring firms overstate their earnings in the quarter preceding a stock swap announcement. I also find evidence of a reversal of the stock price effects of the earnings management in the days leading to the merger announcement. However, the pre-merger reversal is only partial. I find evidence of a post-merger reversal of the stock price effects of the pre-merger earnings management. The results suggest that the extant evidence of post-merger underperformance by acquiring firms is partly attributable to the reversal of the price effects of earnings management. The study also suggests that the post-merger reversal is not fully anticipated by financial analysts in the month immediately following the merger announcement. However, consistent with suggestions in the financial press that managers guide analysts’ forecasts to “beatable” levels, the effect of the earnings management reversal seems to be reflected in the consensus analysts’ forecasts by the time of the subsequent quarterly earnings releases.",['Henock Louis'],"['Merger', 'Earnings management', 'Market efficiency', 'Analyst forecast']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000534,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,74,1
Selling company shares to reluctant employees: France Telecom's experience,"In 1997, France Telecom went through a partial privatization. Using a database that tracks over 200,000 eligible participants, we analyze employees’ decisions whether to participate; how much to invest; and what stock alternatives to select. The results are broadly consistent with a neoclassical model of investing behavior. We report four anomalous findings: (1) The firm specificity of human capital has a negligible effect on employees’ investment decisions; (2) the amount invested seems driven by different forces than the decision to participate, and we attempt to measure an apparent “threshold effect”; (3) employees “left on the table” benefits worth one to two months’ salary by failing to participate; and (4) most participants underweighted the most valuable asset.","['François Degeorge', 'Dirk Jenter', 'Alberto Moel', 'Peter Tufano']","['Privatization', 'Employee ownership', 'Portfolio choice']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001843,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,1
U.S. cross-listings and the private benefits of control: evidence from dual-class firms,"Non-U.S. firms that cross-list on U.S. exchanges have voting premiums that are 43% lower than non-U.S. firms that do not cross-list. The difference in voting premiums is statistically significant after controlling for firm and country characteristics and the difference is larger for firms from countries that provide poor protection to minority investors. When a U.S. listing is announced, both the high- and low-voting share classes benefit, although the low-voting class benefits relatively more.

The illusory nature of momentum profits,"Our paper re-examines the profitability of relative strength or momentum trading strategies (buying past strong performers and selling past weak performers). We find that standard relative strength strategies require frequent trading in disproportionately high cost securities such that trading costs prevent profitable strategy execution. In the cross-section, we find that those stocks that generate large momentum returns are precisely those stocks with high trading costs. We conclude that the magnitude of the abnormal returns associated with these trading strategies creates an illusion of profit opportunity when, in fact, none exists.","['David A.

Information and bank credit allocation,"Private information obtained by lenders leads to borrower capture to the extent that such information cannot be communicated credibly to outsiders. We analyze how this capture affects the loan portfolio allocation of informed lenders. First, we show that banks charge higher interest rates and finance relatively less creditworthy borrowers in market segments with greater information asymmetries. Second, when faced with greater competition from outside lenders, banks reallocate credit toward more captured borrowers (flight to captivity). Third, if borrower quality and captivity are sufficiently correlated, an increase in the competitiveness of uninformed lenders can worsen the informed lender's overall loan portfolio. The model explains observed consequences of financial liberalizations.","[""Giovanni Dell'Ariccia"", 'Robert Marquez']","['Bank competition', 'Credit allocation', 'Cross-border liberalization']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002101,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,1
Disentangling diffusion from jumps,"Realistic models for financial asset prices used in portfolio choice, option pricing or risk management include both a continuous Brownian and a jump components. This paper studies our ability to distinguish one from the other. I find that, surprisingly, it is possible to perfectly disentangle Brownian noise from jumps. This is true even if, unlike the usual Poisson jumps, the jump process exhibits an infinite number of small jumps in any finite time interval, which ought to be harder to distinguish from Brownian noise, itself made up of many small moves.",['Yacine Aı̈t-Sahalia'],"['Poisson jumps', 'Cauchy jumps', 'Lévy process', 'Diffusion', 'Maximum likelihood']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000777,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,74,3
New lists: Fundamentals and survival rates,"The class of firms that obtain public equity financing expands dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s. The number of new firms listed on major U.S. stock markets jumps from 156 per year for 1973–1979 to 549 per year for 1980–2001. The characteristics of new lists also change. The cross section of profitability becomes progressively more left skewed, and growth becomes more right skewed. The result is a sharp decline in survival rates. We suggest that the changes in the characteristics of new lists are due to a decline in the cost of equity that allows weaker firms and firms with more distant expected payoffs to issue public equity.","['Eugene F Fama', 'Kenneth R French']","['New lists', 'IPOs', 'Survival', 'Profitability', 'Growth']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000315,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,2
Time-changed Lévy processes and option pricing,"The classic Black-Scholes option pricing model assumes that returns follow Brownian motion, but return processes differ from this benchmark in at least three important ways. First, asset prices jump, leading to non-normal return innovations. Second, return volatilities vary stochastically over time. Third, returns and their volatilities are correlated, often negatively for equities. Time-changed Lévy processes can simultaneously address these three issues. We show that our framework encompasses almost all of the models proposed in the option pricing literature, and it is straightforward to select and test a particular option pricing model through the use of characteristic function technology.","['Peter Carr', 'Liuren Wu']","['Lévy processes', 'Random time change', 'Option pricing', 'Fourier transforms', 'Measure change']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001715,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,1
Predicting stock price movements from past returns: the role of consistency and tax-loss selling,"The consistency of positive past returns and tax-loss selling significantly affects the relation between past returns and the cross-section of expected returns. Analysis of these additional effects across stock characteristics, seasons, and tax regimes provides clues about the sources of temporal relations in stock returns, pointing to potential explanations for this relation.

Modeling the bid/ask spread: measuring the inventory-holding premium,"The need to understand and measure the determinants of market maker bid/ask spreads is crucial in evaluating the merits of competing market structures and the fairness of market maker rents. This study develops a simple, parsimonious model for the market maker's spread that accounts for the effects of price discreteness induced by minimum tick size, order-processing costs, inventory-holding costs, adverse selection, and competition. The inventory-holding and adverse selection cost components of spread are modeled as an option with a stochastic time to expiration. This inventory-holding premium embedded in the spread represents compensation for the price risk borne by the market maker while the security is held in inventory. The premium is partitioned in such a way that the inventory-holding and adverse selection cost components, as well as the probability of an informed trade, are identified. The model is tested empirically using Nasdaq stocks in three distinct minimum tick size regimes and is shown to perform well both in an absolute sense and relative to competing specifications.","['Nicolas P.B.

We show that lending banks predominantly comanage with a high reputation nonlending underwriter.

Random field models allow consistency with the current shape of the term structure without the need for recalibration. However, most such models are Gaussian, with no conditional volatility. State-dependent volatility is introduced while a key property of Gaussian random field models is retained. Each forward rate is part of a low-dimensional diffusion process, simplifying estimation and derivatives pricing. The modeling approach also implies that, in general, the set of zero coupon bonds does not complete the market, and term structure derivatives cannot always be priced by arbitrage.",['Robert L.

The costs of shared ownership: Evidence from international joint ventures,"This paper analyzes the determinants of partial ownership of the foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational firms and, in particular, the marked decline in the use of joint ventures over the last 20 years. The evidence indicates that whole ownership is most common when firms coordinate integrated production activities across different locations, transfer technology, and benefit from worldwide tax planning. Because operations and ownership levels are jointly determined, it is helpful to use the liberalization of ownership restrictions by host countries and the imposition of joint venture tax penalties in the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 as instruments for ownership levels to identify these effects. Firms responded to these regulatory and tax changes by using wholly owned affiliates instead of joint ventures and expanding intrafirm trade and technology transfer. The implied complementarity of whole ownership and intrafirm trade suggests that the reduced costs of engaging in integrated global operations contributed substantially to the sharply declining propensity of American firms to organize their foreign operations as joint ventures over the last two decades. Estimates imply that as much as one-fifth to three-fifths of the decline in the use of joint ventures by multinational firms is attributable to the increased importance of intrafirm transactions. The forces of globalization appear to have diminished, rather than accelerated, the use of shared ownership.","['Mihir A Desai', 'C.Fritz Foley', 'James R Hines']","['Organizational form', 'Joint ventures', 'Intrafirm transactions', 'Taxation', 'Multinational firms']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000121,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,2
Portfolio choice and health status,"This paper analyzes the role health status plays in household portfolio decisions using data from the Health and Retirement Study. The results indicate that health is a significant predictor of both the probability of owning different types of financial assets and the share of financial wealth held in each asset category. Households in poor health are less likely to hold risky financial assets, other things (including the level of total wealth) being the same. Poor health is associated with a smaller share of financial wealth held in risky assets and a larger share in safe assets. We find no evidence that the relationship between health status and portfolio allocation is driven by “third variables” that simultaneously affect health and financial decisions. Further, the relationship between health status and portfolio choice does not appear to operate through the effect of poor health on individuals’ attitudes toward risk, their planning horizons, or their health insurance status.","['Harvey S Rosen', 'Stephen Wu']","['Portfolio', 'Health', 'Risk']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001788,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,3

The effect of capital structure when expected agency costs are extreme,"This paper conducts powerful new tests of whether debt can mitigate the effects of agency and information problems. We focus on emerging market firms for which pyramid ownership structures create potentially extreme managerial agency costs. Our tests incorporate both traditional financial statement data and new data on global debt contracts. Our analysis is mindful of the potential endogeneity between debt, ownership structure, and value, and it takes into account differences in the debt capacity of a firm's assets in place and future growth opportunities. The results indicate that the incremental benefit of debt is concentrated in firms with high expected managerial agency costs that are also most likely to have overinvestment problems resulting from high levels of assets in place or limited future growth opportunities. Subsequent internationally syndicated term loans are particularly effective at creating value for these firms.

Bailout and conglomeration,"This paper develops a model of business groups in emerging markets where banks cannot accurately distinguish between good (high productivity) and bad (low productivity) borrower firms. For stand-alone firms, banks can infer the proportion of bad firms among those that default on contracted debt repayments, and might optimally choose to liquidate all defaulting firms in order to reduce the number of bad firms. Business groups, however, obscure the productivity of individual firms. The optimal policy might then be full bailout so as not to risk eliminating good firms. Given the bank's bailout policy, risk-averse firms might form a conglomerate to reduce the risk of liquidation.",['Se-Jik Kim'],"['Bailout', 'Business groups', 'Bank loans', 'Institutions']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001910,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,2
The timing and value of forecast and recommendation revisions,"This paper evaluates the information content of analysts’ one-quarter-ahead earnings forecast revisions and recommendation revisions at various points in event time relative to earnings announcement dates. Across three sets of tests, we find that the revisions are least informative in the week after earnings announcements and that the information content of revisions generally increases over event time. We find a sharp increase in the information content of upward forecast revisions and recommendation upgrades in the week before earnings announcements, but we do not find a similar increase for downward revisions or for recommendation downgrades.","['Zoran Ivković', 'Narasimhan Jegadeesh']","['Financial markets', 'Brokerage analysts', 'Earnings forecasts', 'Analysts’ recommendations', 'Asymmetric information']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000522,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,3
The choice of equity-selling mechanisms,"This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry and monitoring of managers on the choice between public offerings and private placements. Three key findings emerge. First, private placement firms have higher information asymmetry than public offering firms. Second, private placement investors do not engage in more monitoring than public offering investors. Finally, discounts for private placements sold to managers are higher than discounts for private placements in which managers do not participate.

Banking market structure and financial stability: Evidence from the Texas real estate crisis in the 1980s,"This paper examines the relationship between banking market structure and financial stability. Using data on thrifts, a type of banking institution specializing in residential mortgage lending, I test two related hypotheses. First, competition reduces franchise value. Second, reduced franchise value induces risk taking. Testing the second hypothesis exploits predictions that when hit by an exogenous shock, the slope of risk with respect to franchise value becomes more negative because thrifts adopt “bang-bang” strategies and choose minimal or maximal risk. Using the Texas real estate collapse in the 1980s as a natural experiment, I find evidence supporting both hypotheses.",['Jie Gan'],"['Market structure', 'Moral hazard', 'Bank risk', 'Franchise value', 'Financial stability']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000728,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,3
Testing market efficiency using statistical arbitrage with applications to momentum and value strategies,"This paper introduces the concept of statistical arbitrage, a long horizon trading opportunity that generates a riskless profit and is designed to exploit persistent anomalies. Statistical arbitrage circumvents the joint hypothesis dilemma of traditional market efficiency tests because its definition is independent of any equilibrium model and its existence is incompatible with market efficiency. We provide a methodology to test for statistical arbitrage and then empirically investigate whether momentum and value trading strategies constitute statistical arbitrage opportunities. Despite adjusting for transaction costs, the influence of small stocks, margin requirements, liquidity buffers for the marking-to-market of short-sales, and higher borrowing rates, we find evidence that these strategies generate statistical arbitrage.","['Steve Hogan', 'Robert Jarrow', 'Melvyn Teo', 'Mitch Warachka']","['Statistical arbitrage', 'Market efficiency', 'Momentum', 'Value']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000947,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,3
Is the IPO pricing process efficient?,"This paper investigates underwriters’ treatment of public information throughout the IPO pricing process. Two key findings emerge. First, public information is not fully incorporated into the initial price range. While the economic magnitude of the bias is small, it is puzzling because it is not clear who benefits from it. Further, it indicates that the filing range midpoint is not an unbiased predictor of the offer price, as prior literature has assumed. Second, while public information is similarly not fully incorporated into the final offer price, the small economic significance of this relation indicates that the IPO pricing process is almost efficient.","['Michelle Lowry', 'G.William Schwert']","['IPO', 'Underpricing', 'Private information', 'Learning', 'Market efficiency']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002058,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,1
The illiquidity puzzle: theory and evidence from private equity,"This paper presents the theory that managers can use the liquidity of securities as a choice variable to screen for deep-pocket investors, those that have a low likelihood of facing a liquidity shock. We assume an information asymmetry about the quality of the manager between the existing investors and the market. The manager then faces a lemons problem when he has to raise funds for a subsequent fund from outside investors, because the outsiders cannot determine whether the manager is of poor quality or the existing investors were hit by a liquidity shock. Thus, liquid investors can reduce the manager's cost of capital in future fundraising. We test the assumptions and predictions of our model in the context of the private equity industry. Consistent with the theory, we find that transfer restrictions on investors are less common in later funds organized by the same private equity firm, where information problems are presumably less severe. Also, partnerships whose investment focus is in industries with longer investment cycles display more transfer constraints. Finally, we present evidence consistent with the assumptions of our model, including the high degree of continuity in the investors of successive funds and the ability of sophisticated investors to anticipate funds that will have poor subsequent performance.","['Josh Lerner', 'Antoinette Schoar']","['Corporate finance', 'Liquidity', 'Fundraising', 'Venture capital']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002034,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,1
Estimating the market risk premium,This paper provides a method for estimating the market risk premium that accounts for shifts in investment opportunities by explicitly modeling the underlying process governing the level of market volatility. I find that approximately 50% of the measured risk premium is related to the risk of future changes in investment opportunities. Evidence of a structural shift in the underlying volatility process suggests that the simple historical average of excess market returns may substantially overstate the magnitude of the market risk premium for the period since the Great Depression.,['E Scott Mayfield'],"['Risk premium', 'Asset pricing', 'Structural breaks', 'Markov-switching models']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0400073X,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,3
Order imbalance and individual stock returns: Theory and evidence,"This paper studies the relation between order imbalances and daily returns of individual stocks. Our tests are motivated by a model which considers how market makers dynamically accommodate autocorrelated imbalances emanating from large traders who optimally choose to split their orders. Price pressures caused by autocorrelated imbalances cause a positive relation between lagged imbalances and returns, which reverses sign after controlling for the current imbalance. We find empirical evidence consistent with these implications. We also find that imbalance-based trading strategies yield statistically significant returns.

The effects of government ownership on bank lending,"This paper uses information on individual loan contracts to study the effects of government ownership on bank lending behavior. State-owned banks charge lower interest rates than do privately owned banks to similar or identical firms, even if firms are able to borrow more from privately owned banks. State-owned banks mostly favor large firms and firms located in depressed areas. The lending behavior of state-owned banks is affected by the electoral results of the party affiliated with the bank: the stronger the political party in the area where the firm is borrowing, the lower the interest rates charged.",['Paola Sapienza'],"['Banking', 'Government', 'Ownership']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002459,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,2
Institutional trading and the turn-of-the-year effect,"This study provides evidence that links institutional trading behavior directly to anomalous turn-of-the-year return patterns of small stocks. We find that turn-of-the-year trading patterns of institutions reflect strategies generally consistent with window-dressing and risk-shifting behaviors. Institutions sell more loser small stocks in the last quarter of the year, but buy more small stocks, winners and losers, in the first quarter. Institutional buying (selling) of loser stocks at year-end weakens (strengthens) the turn-of-the-year effect. Buying of winner stocks after year-end causes a statistically significant, though weaker, effect.","['Lilian Ng', 'Qinghai Wang']","['Institutions', 'Window-dressing', 'Risk-shifting', 'Turn-of-the-year effect']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000741,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,74,2
Investibility and return volatility,"Unlike previous studies that examine how emerging market return volatility changes subsequent to stock market liberalization, this paper investigates the impact of investibility, or the degree to which a stock can be foreign-owned, on emerging market volatility. We find a positive relation between return volatility and the investibility of individual stocks, even after controlling for country, industry, firm size, and turnover. We also find that a highly investible emerging market portfolio is subject to larger world market exposure than a non-investible portfolio, suggesting that highly investible stocks are more integrated with the world and therefore more vulnerable to world market risk.","['Kee-Hong Bae', 'Kalok Chan', 'Angela Ng']","['Emerging market', 'Stock return volatility', 'Investibility', 'Market integration']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001661,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,2

The results suggest that insurers in the two largest size quartiles can hedge losses almost as effectively using contracts based on four intrastate indices as they can using contracts that settle on their own losses. Many insurers in the third largest size quartile also can hedge effectively using the intrastate indices, but most insurers in the smallest quartile would encounter significant basis risk.

Style effects in the cross-section of stock returns,"Using CRSP stock and mutual fund data, we find strong evidence for reversals at the style level (e.g., large value, small growth, etc.). There are significant excess and risk-adjusted returns for stocks in styles characterized by the worst past returns and net inflows. We also find evidence for momentum and positive feedback trading at the style level. These value and momentum effects are driven neither by fundamental risk nor by stock-level reversals and momentum.

Internal capital markets and investment policy: evidence from corporate spinoffs,"We analyze changes in investment policy following 106 spinoffs between 1981 and 1996. Pre-spinoff, the sample firms are valued at a discount and invest less in their high q segments than do their single-segment peers. Post-spinoff, there is a significant increase in measures of investment efficiency and the diversification discount is eliminated. Furthermore, changes in excess value around the spinoff are positively related to changes in measures of investment efficiency. These findings support the view that (i) diversified firms allocate investment funds inefficiently, and (ii) by breaking up the conglomerate, spinoffs create value by improving investment efficiency.","['Seoungpil Ahn', 'David J Denis']","['Internal capital markets', 'Spinoffs', 'Diversification']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0300165X,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,3
The impact of stock market information production on internal resource allocation,"We analyze the resource allocation decision of a manager inside a multidivision firm whose compensation is based on the firm's stock price. We find that internal investments exhibit a positive correlation across the firms divisions. Namely, when two single-division firms merge the optimal investment level in one division becomes more positively related to the investment level in the other division. In addition, following a spinoff, divisional investments decline (increase) whenever the separated division has a project with a low (high) Sharpe ratio. Finally, multidivision firms trade at a discount which is larger the more diverse the investment sets of the divisions.",['Eitan Goldman'],"['Internal markets', 'Resource allocation', 'Spinoff', 'Information production']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001776,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,1

The evidence indicates that large bank holding companies (BHC), traded on the NYSE, have very similar trading properties to their matched nonfinancial firms. In contrast, smaller BHCs, traded on NASDAQ, trade much less frequently despite having very similar spreads. Analysis of IBES earnings forecasts indicates that banking assets are not unusually opaque; they are simply boring.

Management turnover in subsidiaries of conglomerates versus stand-alone firms,"We compare turnover of subsidiary managers inside conglomerate firms to turnover of CEOs of comparable stand-alone firms. We find that, compared to turnover of CEOs, subsidiary manager turnover is significantly more sensitive to changes in performance and significantly more likely following poor performance. For subsidiary managers, the relation between turnover and performance is significantly stronger when the subsidiary operates in an industry that is related to the parent's primary industry. Results suggest that boards of directors are relatively ineffective disciplinarians of CEOs and despite their other apparent failings, conglomerate firms have relatively strict disciplining mechanisms for subsidiary managers.","['Chris McNeil', 'Greg Niehaus', 'Eric Powers']","['Management turnover', 'Internal labor market', 'Conglomerates']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001909,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,1
A theory of corporate spin-offs,"We develop a new rationale for corporate spin-offs, and for the performance and value improvements following them, based on corporate control considerations. We consider a firm with multiple divisions, with incumbent management having different abilities for managing these divisions. If the incumbent loses control to a more able rival, it benefits all shareholders (including the incumbent) by increasing equity value, but involves the incumbent losing his private benefits of control. We show that a spin-off increases the incumbent's chance of losing control to such a rival. This, in turn, motivates the incumbent either to work harder at managing the firm (in order to avoid any loss of control), or to relinquish control of one of the firms resulting from the spin-off (either immediately following the spin-off, or subsequently in a control contest). We show that spin-offs will be associated with positive announcement effects and increases in long-term operating performance. Further, certain categories of spin-offs will exhibit long-term positive abnormal stock returns.","['Thomas J.

The effect of capital market characteristics on the value of start-up firms,"We develop an equilibrium model of contracting, bargaining, and search in which the relative scarcity of venture capital affects the bargaining power of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. This in turn affects the pricing, contracting, and value creation in start-ups. The relative scarcity of venture capital is endogenous and depends on the profitability of venture capital investments, entry costs, and transparency of the venture capital market. Supply and demand conditions also affect the incentives of venture capitalists to screen projects ex ante. We characterize both the short- and long-run dynamics of the venture capital industry, which provides us with a stylized picture of the Internet boom and bust periods. Our model is consistent with existing evidence and provides a number of new empirical predictions.","['Roman Inderst', 'Holger M.

Second, we show that each of these trends lines up with a corresponding fluctuation in catering incentives: The propensity to pay increases when a proxy for the stock market dividend premium is positive and decreases when it is negative. The lone disconnect is attributable to Nixon-era controls.","['Malcolm Baker', 'Jeffrey Wurgler']","['Dividends', 'Payout policy', 'Catering', 'Dividend premium', 'Investor sentiment']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000078,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,2
Smart investments by smart money: Evidence from seasoned equity offerings,"We document that seasoned equity issuers experiencing the greatest increase in institutional investment around the offer date outperformed their benchmark portfolios in the year following the issue by a statistically and economically significant margin relative to those experiencing the greatest decrease. No such relationship exists for a control sample of matched non-issuers. Issuers with the greatest institutional investment are also found to have the highest ratio of sell-side analyst upgrades less downgrades to total forecasts in the two quarters following the issue. Again, no such relationship is found for matched non-issuers.

The equally weighted abnormal announcement return is 1.1%, but acquiring-firm shareholders lose $25.2 million on average upon announcement. This disparity suggests the existence of a size effect in acquisition announcement returns. The announcement return for acquiring-firm shareholders is roughly two percentage points higher for small acquirers irrespective of the form of financing and whether the acquired firm is public or private. The size effect is robust to firm and deal characteristics, and it is not reversed over time.","['Sara B Moeller', 'Frederik P Schlingemann', 'René M Stulz']","['Acquisitions', 'Bidder', 'Size effect', 'Organizational form']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000327,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,2
Managerial succession and firm performance,"We examine CEO turnover and firm financial performance. Accounting measures of performance relative to other firms deteriorate prior to CEO turnover and improve thereafter. The degree of improvement is positively related to the level of institutional shareholdings, the presence of an outsider-dominated board, and the appointment of an outsider (rather than an insider) CEO. Turnover announcements are associated with significantly positive average abnormal stock returns, which are in turn significantly positively related to subsequent changes in accounting measures of performance. This suggests that investors view turnover announcements as good news presaging performance improvements.","['Mark R. Huson', 'Paul H.

The impact of illegal insider trading in dealer and specialist markets: evidence from a natural experiment,"We examine insider trading in specialist and dealer markets, using the trades of stock brokers who had advance copies of a stock analysis column in Business Week magazine. We find that increases in price and volume occur after informed trades. During informed trading, market makers decrease depth. Depth falls more on the NYSE and Amex than on the Nasdaq. Spreads increase on the NYSE and Amex, but not on the Nasdaq. We find none of these pre-release changes in a nontraded control sample of stocks mentioned in the column. Our results show that insider trading has a negative impact on market liquidity; depth is an important tool to manage asymmetric information risk; and specialist markets are better at detecting informed trades.","['Raymond P.H Fishe', 'Michel A Robe']","['Insider trading', 'Depth', 'Liquidity', 'Specialist and dealer markets']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001880,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,3

Their portfolio risk choices differed predictably from a randomly selected group of nonperformance fee funds and a group of performance fee funds that were not required to change their compensation contracts.

Restrictions are more common when (i) boards contain a higher proportion of inside directors, (ii) the portfolio manager is more experienced, (iii) the fund is managed by a team rather than an individual, and (iv) the fund does not belong to a large organizational complex.

Does an electronic stock exchange need an upstairs market?,"We examine the Paris Bourse, whose electronic limit order market closely resembles the downstairs markets envisioned by theorists, to test several theoretical predictions regarding upstairs trading. We present direct evidence in support of the Grossman (J. Business (1992) 509) prediction that upstairs brokers lower execution costs by tapping into unexpressed liquidity, as actual execution costs upstairs are on average only 20% (35%) as large as they would be if block trades were executed against displayed (displayed and hidden) liquidity in the downstairs limit order book. Consistent with prior analyses, the Paris data also support the Seppi (J. Finance (1990) 73) hypothesis that upstairs brokers certify trades as uninformed. We also find that participants in stocks with less restrictive crossing rules agree to outside-the-quote executions for more difficult trades and at times when downstairs liquidity is lacking. These likely represent trades that could not have been otherwise completed, suggesting that market quality can be enhanced by allowing participants more flexibility to execute blocks at prices outside the quotes.","['Hendrik Bessembinder', 'Kumar Venkataraman']","['Upstairs market', 'Limit order book', 'Electronic exchange', 'Crossing rules']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0400011X,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,1
"Grandstanding, certification and the underpricing of venture capital backed IPOs","We examine the role of venture capital backing in the underpricing of IPOs. Controlling for endogeneity in the receipt of venture funding, we find that venture capital backed IPOs experience larger first-day returns than comparable non-venture backed IPOs. Between 1980 and 2000, the average return difference ranges from 5.01 percentage points to 10.32 percentage points. This return difference is particularly pronounced in the “bubble” period of 1999–2000. Consistent with the grandstanding hypothesis proposed by Gompers (J. Financial Econ. 42 (1996) 133), we find that higher underpricing leads to larger future flows of capital into venture capital funds, particularly after 1996. Cross-sectionally, the effect of underpricing is attenuated for younger venture capital firms and those that have previously conducted fewer IPOs.","['Peggy M.

Determinants of target capital structure: The case of dual debt and equity issues,"We examine whether market and operating performance affect corporate financing behavior because they are related to target leverage. Our focus on firms that issue both debt and equity enhances our ability to draw inferences. Consistent with dynamic trade-off theories, dual issuers offset the deviation from the target resulting from accumulation of earnings and losses. Our results also imply that high market-to-book firms have low target debt ratios. On the other hand, consistent with market timing, high stock returns increase the probability of equity issuance but have no effect on target leverage.","['Armen Hovakimian', 'Gayane Hovakimian', 'Hassan Tehranian']","['Capital structure', 'Target leverage', 'Equity market timing', 'Dual issues']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03001818,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,71,3

Violations of put–call parity are asymmetric in the direction of short sales constraints, and their magnitudes are strongly related to the cost and difficulty of short selling. These violations are also related to both the maturity of the option and the level of valuations in the stock market, consistent with a behavioral finance theory of over-optimistic stock investors and market segmentation.

Gains in bank mergers: Evidence from the bond markets,"We present evidence that the adjusted returns of merging banks’ bonds are positive and significant across pre-merger and announcement months. The cross-sectional evidence indicates that the primary determinants of merger-related bondholder gains are diversification gains, gains associated with achieving too-big-to-fail status, and, to a lesser degree, synergy gains. We obtain the same finding when we examine the acquiring banks’ credit spreads on new debt issues both before and after the merger. We also provide the first study that shows acquirers benefit by the lower cost of funds on post-merger debt issues.","['Marı́a Fabiana Penas', 'Haluk Unal']","['Bank mergers', 'Bondholder gains', 'Too big to fail']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000108,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,74,1
Measuring stock illiquidity: An investigation of the demand and supply schedules at the TASE,We show that estimating demand and supply elasticities at the opening stage of trading at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is highly sensitive to which of several reasonable measures is used. We find that the demand curve is more elastic than the supply curve and that both are much more elastic in their “executable” areas. The empirical evidence indicates that elasticity is increasing during the continuous stage of trading. We discuss methods of estimation of price impact and document that the actual measure of price impact in call auctions is larger and more permanent for buys than for sells.,"['Avner Kalay', 'Orly Sade', 'Avi Wohl']","['Liquidity', 'Elasticity', 'Price impact']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000716,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,74,3
Cross-country determinants of mergers and acquisitions,"We study the determinants of mergers and acquisitions around the world by focusing on differences in laws and regulation across countries. We find that the volume of M&A activity is significantly larger in countries with better accounting standards and stronger shareholder protection. The probability of an all-cash bid decreases with the level of shareholder protection in the acquirer country. In cross-border deals, targets are typically from countries with poorer investor protection than their acquirers’ countries, suggesting that cross-border transactions play a governance role by improving the degree of investor protection within target firms.","['Stefano Rossi', 'Paolo F.

Leverage decision and manager compensation with choice of effort and volatility,"We study the incentive effects of granting levered or unlevered stock to a risk-averse manager. The stock is granted by risk-neutral shareholders who choose leverage and compensation level. The manager applies costly effort and selects the level of volatility, both of which affect expected return. The results are driven by the attempt of the risk-neutral shareholders to maximize the value of their claims net of the compensation package. We consider a dynamic setting and find that levered stock is optimal for high-type managers, firms with high momentum, large firms, and firms for which additional volatility only implies a modest increase in expected return.","['Abel Cadenillas', 'Jakša Cvitanić', 'Fernando Zapatero']","['Capital structure', 'Principal-agent', 'Stochastic control']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X04000133,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,73,1
"Who is in whose pocket? Director compensation, board independence, and barriers to effective monitoring","We use a bargaining framework to examine empirically the relations between director compensation and board-of-director independence. Our evidence suggests that independent directors have a bargaining advantage over the CEO that results in compensation more closely aligned with shareholders’ objectives. Firms with more outsiders on their boards award directors more equity-based compensation. When the CEO's power over the board increases, compensation provides weaker incentives to monitor. Firms with more inside directors and with entrenched CEOs use less equity-based pay. Furthermore, firms with entrenched CEOs and CEOs who also chair the board are less likely to replace cash pay with equity.","['Harley E. Ryan', 'Roy A.

The importance of the loss function in option valuation,"Which loss function should be used when estimating and evaluating option valuation models? Many different functions have been suggested, but no standard has emerged. We emphasize that consistency in the choice of loss functions is crucial. First, for any given model, the loss function used in parameter estimation and model evaluation should be the same, otherwise suboptimal parameter estimates may be obtained. Second, when comparing models, the estimation loss function should be identical across models, otherwise inappropriate comparisons will be made. We illustrate the importance of these issues in an application of the so-called Practitioner Black-Scholes model to S&P 500 index options.","['Peter Christoffersen', 'Kris Jacobs']","['Implied volatility functions', 'Valuation errors', 'Out-of-sample forecasting', 'Parameter stability']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X03002447,Journal of Financial Economics,2004,72,2
