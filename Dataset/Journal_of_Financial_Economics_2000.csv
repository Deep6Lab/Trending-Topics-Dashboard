DOS Kapital: Has antitrust action against Microsoft created value in the computer industry?,"Antitrust enforcement that efficiently constrains Microsoft's behavior benefits firms supplying complements to and/or substitutes for Microsoft's operating system and applications software. However, from 1991 through 1997, 29 reports of federal antitrust enforcement action against Microsoft were accompanied by declines in the value of an index of 159 computer industry firms (excluding Microsoft). The mean loss to those firms exceeded $1 billion per event. Eight retreats or setbacks in enforcement were associated with increased computer sector value. Thus, financial markets reveal compelling evidence against the joint hypothesis that (a) Microsoft conduct is anticompetitive and (b) antitrust policy enforcement produces net efficiency gains.","['George Bittlingmayer', 'Thomas W Hazlett']","['Financial effects of regulation', 'Antitrust', 'Monopoly', 'Computer industry', 'Microsoft']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000537,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,55,3
When is time continuous?,"Continuous-time stochastic processes are approximations to physically realizable phenomena. We quantify one aspect of the approximation errors by characterizing the asymptotic distribution of the replication errors that arise from delta-hedging derivative securities in discrete time, and introducing the notion of temporal granularity which measures the extent to which discrete-time implementations of continuous-time models can track the payoff of a derivative security. We show that granularity is a particular function of a derivative contract's terms and the parameters of the underlying stochastic process. Explicit expressions for the granularity of geometric Brownian motion and an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process for call and put options are derived, and we perform Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the empirical properties of granularity.","['Dimitris Bertsimas', 'Leonid Kogan', 'Andrew W.

Uniformly least powerful tests of market efficiency,"Defenders of market efficiency argue that anomalies involving long-term abnormal returns are not robust to alternative methodologies. We argue that because various methodologies use different weighting schemes, the magnitude of abnormal returns should differ, and in a predictable manner. Three problems are identified that cause low power in value-weighted three-factor time series regressions when abnormal returns following managerial actions are being estimated. We illustrate the sensitivities in the context of the new issues puzzle as well as with simulations. More generally, multifactor models as currently used do not, and cannot, test market efficiency.","['Tim Loughran', 'Jay R.

The term structure of very short-term rates: New evidence for the expectations hypothesis,"Empirical researchers have frequently rejected the expectations hypothesis. The expectations hypothesis, however, has seldom, if ever, been tested at the extreme short end of the term structure where maturities are measured in days or weeks. Using overnight, weekly, and monthly repo rates, I find that term rates are almost unbiased estimates of the average overnight rate. This evidence provides new support for the expectations hypothesis.",['Francis A.

Financial markets and the allocation of capital,"Financial markets appear to improve the allocation of capital. Across 65 countries, those with developed financial sectors increase investment more in their growing industries, and decrease investment more in their declining industries, than those with undeveloped financial sectors. The efficiency of capital allocation is negatively correlated with the extent of state ownership in the economy, positively correlated with the amount of firm-specific information in domestic stock returns, and positively correlated with the legal protection of minority investors. In particular, strong minority investor rights appear to curb overinvestment in declining industries.",['Jeffrey Wurgler'],"['Capital allocation', 'Investment', 'Economic growth', 'State ownership']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000702,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
Speed of issuance and the adequacy of disclosure in the 144A high-yield debt market,"I document the shift of high-yield issuance from the public to the Rule 144A private placement market and exploit data on credit spreads to investigate whether investors regard disclosure in the two markets as comparable. The key implications of the inadequate-disclosure hypothesis are that investors require premiums on 144A securities and that such premiums are largest for first-time bond issuers and privately owned firms about whom less information is publicly available. I find that 144A premiums, though positive initially, have vanished over time, and I find no evidence of larger 144A premiums for first-time issuers or private firms. Investors do, however, require premiums of first-time issuers, and to a lesser extent of privately owned firms, regardless of whether securities are issued in the 144A or public market. These findings imply that sophisticated investors do not value the incremental information provided by securities registration, but do value ongoing disclosure.",['George W Fenn'],"['Junk bonds', 'Rule 144A', 'Private placements']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000453,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,3
Testing static tradeoff against pecking order models of capital structure: a critical comment,"In a recent paper, Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) introduce a new test of the Pecking Order Model. This comment shows that their elegantly simple test generates misleading inferences when evaluating plausible patterns of external financing. Our results, coupled with the power problem with the Static Tradeoff Model documented by Shyam-Sunder and Myers, indicate that their empirical evidence can evaluate neither the Pecking Order nor Static Tradeoff Models. Alternative tests are needed that can identify the determinants of capital structure and can discriminate among competing hypotheses.","['Robert S Chirinko', 'Anuja R Singha']","['Financing', 'Capital structure', 'Pecking order theory']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000787,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,3
Just another day in the inter-bank foreign exchange market,"In this paper, I develop a theory of bid–ask quotes provided by foreign exchange dealers in the inter-bank market based on their beliefs and their inventory positions. I then build an agent-based model of the inter-dealer market where dealers learn in a Bayesian manner from quotes from other dealers. Using simulations, I find that the resulting intra-day spreads and between-quote returns largely conform to the empirically observed intra-day U-shaped pattern – a feature that has not been satisfactorily explained in the literature. I also study the factors that determine this U-shape.",['Rajesh Chakrabarti'],"['Agent based model', 'Foreign exchange', 'Microstructure']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000586,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,1
Investor protection and corporate governance,"Recent research has documented large differences among countries in ownership concentration in publicly traded firms, in the breadth and depth of capital markets, in dividend policies, and in the access of firms to external finance. A common element to the explanations of these differences is how well investors, both shareholders and creditors, are protected by law from expropriation by the managers and controlling shareholders of firms. We describe the differences in laws and the effectiveness of their enforcement across countries, discuss the possible origins of these differences, summarize their consequences, and assess potential strategies of corporate governance reform. We argue that the legal approach is a more fruitful way to understand corporate governance and its reform than the conventional distinction between bank-centered and market-centered financial systems.","['Rafael La Porta', 'Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes', 'Andrei Shleifer', 'Robert Vishny']","['Investor, protection', 'Corporate governance', 'Law']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000659,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
When an event is not an event: the curious case of an emerging market,"Shares trading in the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores do not seem to react to company news. Using a sample of Mexican corporate news announcements from the period July 1994 through June 1997, this paper finds that there is nothing unusual about returns, volatility of returns, volume of trade or bid–ask spreads in the event window. We provide evidence that suggests that unrestricted insider trading causes prices to fully incorporate the information before its public release. The paper thus points toward a methodology for ranking emerging stock markets in terms of their market integrity, an approach that can be used with the limited data available in such markets.","['Utpal Bhattacharya', 'Hazem Daouk', 'Brian Jorgenson', 'Carl-Heinrich Kehr']","['Insider trading', 'Event studies', 'Emerging markets']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000458,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,55,1
Do stock market liberalizations cause investment booms?,"Stock market liberalizations lead private investment booms. In a sample of 11 developing countries that liberalized their stock markets, 9 experience growth rates of private investment above their non-liberalization median in the first year after liberalizing. In the second and third years after liberalization, this number is 10 of 11 and 8 of 11, respectively. The mean growth rate of private investment in the three years immediately following stock market liberalization exceeds the sample mean by 22 percentage points. The evidence stands in sharp contrast to recent work that suggests capital account liberalization has no effect on investment.",['Peter Blair Henry'],"['Capital account liberalization', 'Investment', 'Capital flows', 'Emerging markets']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000738,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
The information content of stock markets: why do emerging markets have synchronous stock price movements?,"Stock prices move together more in poor economies than in rich economies. This finding is not due to market size and is only partially explained by higher fundamentals correlation in low-income economies. However, measures of property rights do explain this difference. The systematic component of returns variation is large in emerging markets, and appears unrelated to fundamentals co-movement, consistent with noise trader risk. Among developed economy stock markets, higher firm-specific returns variation is associated with stronger public investor property rights. We propose that strong property rights promote informed arbitrage, which capitalizes detailed firm-specific information.","['Randall Morck', 'Bernard Yeung', 'Wayne Yu']","['Asset pricing', 'Information and market efficiency', 'Event studies', 'International financial markets', 'Financial economics']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000714,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
Seasoned public offerings: resolution of the ‘new issues puzzle’,"The ‘new issues puzzle’ is that stocks of common stock issuers subsequently underperform nonissuers matched on size and book-to-market ratio. With 7000+ seasoned equity and debt issues, we document that issuer underperformance reflects lower systematic risk exposure for issuing firms relative to the matches. A consistent explanation is that, as equity issuers lower leverage, their exposures to unexpected inflation and default risks decrease, thus decreasing their stocks’ expected returns relative to matched firms. Equity issues also significantly increase stock liquidity (turnover), again lowering expected returns relative to nonissuers. We conclude that the ‘new issue puzzle’ is explained by a failure of the matched-firm technique to provide a proper control for risk. This conclusion is robust to issue characteristics and the choice of factor model framework.","['B.Espen Eckbo', 'Ronald W.

Corporate governance in the Asian financial crisis,"The “Asian Crisis” of 1997–98 affected all the “emerging markets” open to capital flows. Measures of corporate governance, particularly the effectiveness of protection for minority shareholders, explain the extent of exchange rate depreciation and stock market decline better than do standard macroeconomic measures. A possible explanation is that in countries with weak corporate governance, worse economic prospects result in more expropriation by managers and thus a larger fall in asset prices.","['Simon Johnson', 'Peter Boone', 'Alasdair Breach', 'Eric Friedman']","['Corporate governance', 'Investor protection', 'Financial crisis']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000696,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
Herding among security analysts,"The paper shows that the buy or sell recommendations of security analysts have a significant positive influence on the recommendations of the next two analysts. This influence can be traced to short-lived information in the most recent revisions. In contrast, the influence of the prevailing consensus is not stronger if the consensus accurately forecasts subsequent stock price movements. This indicates consensus herding consistent with models in which analysts herd based on little information. The consensus also has a stronger influence when market conditions are favorable. The resulting poorer information aggregation could cause bull markets to be intrinsically more “fragile” (e.g., Bikhchandani et al., J.

On the optimality of resetting executive stock options,"The practice of resetting strike prices on underwater executive stock options has drawn criticism for weakening managerial incentives. Our model shows that although the anticipation of resetting can negatively affect initial incentives, resetting can still be an important, value-enhancing aspect of compensation contracts, even from an ex-ante standpoint. In fact, we find that some resetting is almost always optimal. The relative advantages of resetting diminish with greater ability of managers to influence the resetting process, greater relative importance of external factors on stock performance, and lower costs of replacing incumbent managers.","['Viral V.

A study towards a unified approach to the joint estimation of objective and risk neutral measures for the purpose of options valuation,"The purpose of this paper is to bridge two strands of the literature, one pertaining to the objective or physical measure used to model an underlying asset and the other pertaining to the risk-neutral measure used to price derivatives. We propose a generic procedure using simultaneously the fundamental price, St, and a set of option contracts [(σitI)i=1,m] where m⩾1 and σitI is the Black–Scholes implied volatility. We use Heston's (1993. Review of Financial Studies 6, 327–343) model as an example, and appraise univariate and multivariate estimation of the model in terms of pricing and hedging performance. Our results, based on the S&P 500 index contract, show dominance of univariate approach, which relies solely on options data. A by-product of this finding is that we uncover a remarkably simple volatility extraction filter based on a polynomial lag structure of implied volatilities. The bivariate approach, involving both the fundamental security and an option contract, appears useful when the information from the cash market reflected in the conditional kurtosis provides support to price long term.","['Mikhail Chernov', 'Eric Ghysels']","['Derivative securities', 'Efficient method of moments', 'State price densities', 'Stochastic volatility models', 'Filtering']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000465,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,3
From cradle to grave: How to loot a 401(k) plan,"The regulations governing asset distributions from many retirement plans give participants the option to time retirement or rollovers from the plan strategically. They possess a long-lived put option, whose exercise price resets periodically to the current value of the assets in the plan. I derive a recursive closed-form valuation formula for the option and develop a numerical algorithm for implementing the result. I find that, for reasonable assumptions about volatility and life expectancy, the option's value may approach 40% of the value of the assets in the plan, financed entirely by those still contributing. This wealth transfer can, however, be easily avoided by making a simple change to the current regulations governing valuation and payout of these retirement plans.",['Richard Stanton'],"['401(k) plan', 'Pension plan', 'Rollover', 'Option valuation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000489,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,3
Controlling stockholders and the disciplinary role of corporate payout policy: a study of the Times Mirror Company,"The Times Mirror Company, a NYSE-listed Fortune 500 firm controlled for 100 years by the Chandler family, hired an industry outsider as CEO in 1995 following an extended period of poor operating and stock price performance under non-family management. This change was apparently an unintended consequence of actions taken by old management to fund its capital expansion plans while satisfying the family's desire for dividends. Specifically, in 1994 old management agreed to (1) sell TM's cable business and reinvest most of the $1.3 billion proceeds in new technology, and (2) maintain the Chandlers’ dividends while radically cutting those to minority stockholders. While Wall Street reacted favorably to the cable sale, it punished TM's stock when it later learned about management's reinvestment plans. Shortly thereafter TM's board brought in a noted financial disciplinarian, who as CEO substantially increased stockholder value by terminating low return investments and distributing free cash flow. While pressure to pay dividends and monitoring by large block stockholders ultimately improved TM's performance, the path to this outcome was slow and circuitous, so that these disciplinary forces were weaker than theory typically implies.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo']","['Payout policy', 'Controlling stockholders', 'Family control']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000398,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,2
Spanning and derivative-security valuation,"This article provides the economic foundations for valuing derivative securities. In particular, it establishes how the characteristic function (of the future uncertainty) is basis augmenting and spans the payoff universe of most, if not all, derivative assets. From the characteristic function of the state-price density, it is possible to analytically price options on any arbitrary transformation of the underlying uncertainty. By differentiating (or translating) the characteristic function, limitless pricing and/or spanning opportunities can be designed. The strength and versatility of the methodology is inherent when valuing (1) average-interest options, (2) correlation options, and (3) discretely monitored knock-out options.","['Gurdip Bakshi', 'Dilip Madan']","['Spanning', 'Characteristic functions', 'State-price density', 'Pricing of contingent claims', 'Arrow–Debreu securities']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000501,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,55,2
Making markets for structured mortgage derivatives,"This paper distinguishes between securitization, in which simple pass-through instruments are created, and structuring, in which mortgages derivative claims are created. The point is to explain how structuring a transaction brings value to a deal's underwriter. Briefly, an underwriter must defeat arbitrage between pass-throughs and derivatives. The potential for market segmentation and price discrimination by the underwriter is used to analyze the structuring process. In the course of the analysis, the legal rules for trusts, the algebraic rules for structuring, and the limits on permissible price discrimination are discussed. Results for an actual transaction illustrate the important features of the analysis.",['George S.

Special dividends and the evolution of dividend signaling,"This paper documents that (1) special dividends were once commonly paid by NYSE firms, but are now rarely paid; (2) firms typically paid specials almost as predictably as they paid regular dividends; (3) despite the dramatic overall decline in specials, the incidence of very large specials increased in recent years; and (4) special dividends were not displaced by stock repurchases. Most plausibly, small specials disappeared because their predictability made them close substitutes for regular dividend signals, while large specials survived because their sheer size automatically differentiates them from regulars.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Douglas J.

Finance and the sources of growth,"This paper evaluates the empirical relation between the level of financial intermediary development and (i) economic growth, (ii) total factor productivity growth, (iii) physical capital accumulation, and (iv) private savings rates. We use (a) a pure cross-country instrumental variable estimator to extract the exogenous component of financial intermediary development, and (b) a new panel technique that controls for biases associated with simultaneity and unobserved country-specific effects. After controlling for these potential biases, we find that (1) financial intermediaries exert a large, positive impact on total factor productivity growth, which feeds through to overall GDP growth and (2) the long-run links between financial intermediary development and both physical capital growth and private savings rates are tenuous.","['Thorsten Beck', 'Ross Levine', 'Norman Loayza']","['Financial development', 'Economic growth', 'Capital accumulation', 'Productivity growth', 'Saving']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000726,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
Corporate policies restricting trading by insiders,"This paper examines policies and procedures put in place by corporations to regulate trading in the stock by the firm's own insiders. Over 92% of our sample companies have their own policies restricting trading by insiders, and 78% have explicit blackout periods during which the company prohibits trading by its insiders. Our data indicate that blackout periods successfully suppress trading, both purchases and sales, by insiders, and that the blackout period is associated with a bid–ask spread that's narrower by about two basis points. Consistent with this effect on the spread, allowed insider trades are modestly more profitable than insider trades made during prohibited blackout periods.","['J.C Bettis', 'J.L Coles', 'M.L Lemmon']","['Insider trading', 'Regulation', 'Corporate policy', 'Liquidity']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000556,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,57,2
An empirical examination of the convexity bias in the pricing of interest rate swaps,"This paper examines the convexity bias, caused by the non-linearity of payoffs, in the pricing of interest rate swaps off the Eurocurrency futures curve. The evidence from four major currencies – $, £, DM and ¥ – during 1987–1996 suggests that swaps were initially being priced off the futures curve (ignoring the convexity adjustment); subsequently, the market swap rates drifted below the rates implied by futures prices. After rejecting alternative explanations, we use alternative term structure models to show that the convexity bias is related to the empirically observed swap-futures differential. We interpret these results as evidence of mispricing of swap contracts during the early years, which was eliminated over time.","['Anurag Gupta', 'Marti G.

The costs and determinants of order aggressiveness,"This paper examines the costs and determinants of order aggressiveness. Aggressive orders have larger price impacts but smaller opportunity costs than passive orders. Price impacts are amplified by large orders, small firms, and volatile stock prices. To minimize the implementation shortfall, the optimal strategy is to enter buy (sell) orders at the bid (ask). Aggressive buy (sell) orders tend to follow other aggressive buy (sell) orders and occur when bid–ask spreads are narrow and depth on the same (opposite) side of the limit book is large (small). Aggressive buys are more likely than sells to be motivated by information.","['Mark D Griffiths', 'Brian F Smith', 'D.Alasdair S Turnbull', 'Robert W White']","['Price impact', 'Limit orders']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000598,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,1

"Trade size, order imbalance, and the volatility–volume relation","This paper examines the roles of the number of trades, size of trades, and order imbalance (buyer- versus seller-initiated trades) in explaining the volatility–volume relation for a sample of NYSE and Nasdaq stocks. Our results reconfirm the significance of the size of trades, beyond that of the number of trades, in the volatility–volume relation on both markets. After controlling for the return impact of order imbalance, the volatility–volume relation becomes much weaker. For NYSE stocks, the order imbalance in large trade size categories affects the return more than in smaller size categories.

Can transparent markets survive?,"This paper investigates whether transparent markets can survive when faced with direct competition from less transparent markets. We first construct a game-theoretic model in which in equilibrium the low-transparency dealers capture early order flow, and use the resulting informational advantage to quote narrower spreads and earn more profits than their more transparent competitors. We then conduct a laboratory experiment that tests and supports all of these predictions. A second experiment shows that most dealers choose to be of lower transparency when they are allowed to do so. However, the informational advantage of low-transparency decreases as there are more such dealers, while the high-transparency dealers get increasing benefit from informed traders who attempt to broadcast deceptive trades. As a result, a small number of transparent dealers persist in our markets.","['Robert Bloomfield', ""Maureen O'Hara""]","['Market microstructure', 'Experimental economics', 'Stock market competition']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000562,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,55,3
Financial flexibility and the choice between dividends and stock repurchases,"This paper measures the growth in open market stock repurchases and the manner in which stock repurchases and dividends are used by U.S. corporations. Stock repurchases and dividends are used at different times from one another, by different kinds of firms. Stock repurchases are very pro-cyclical, while dividends increase steadily over time. Dividends are paid by firms with higher “permanent” operating cash flows, while repurchases are used by firms with higher “temporary”, non-operating cash flows. Repurchasing firms also have much more volatile cash flows and distributions. Finally, firms repurchase stock following poor stock market performance and increase dividends following good performance. These results are consistent with the view that the flexibility inherent in repurchase programs is one reason why they are sometimes used instead of dividends.","['Murali Jagannathan', 'Clifford P Stephens', 'Michael S Weisbach']","['Payout policy', 'Stock repurchases', 'Dividends']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000611,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,57,3

Three-quarters of the firms are auctioned as going concerns, which is similar to Chapter 11 survival rates.

Commonality in liquidity,"Traditionally and understandably, the microscope of market microstructure has focused on attributes of single assets. Little theoretical attention and virtually no empirical work has been devoted to common determinants of liquidity nor to their empirical manifestation, correlated movements in liquidity. But a wider-angle lens exposes an imposing image of commonality. Quoted spreads, quoted depth, and effective spreads co-move with market- and industry-wide liquidity. After controlling for well-known individual liquidity determinants, such as volatility, volume, and price, common influences remain significant and material. Recognizing the existence of commonality is a key to uncovering some suggestive evidence that inventory risks and asymmetric information both affect intertemporal changes in liquidity.","['Tarun Chordia', 'Richard Roll', 'Avanidhar Subrahmanyam']","['Liquidity', 'Trading costs', 'Co-movement', 'Microstructure']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000574,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,1
The investment behavior and performance of various investor types: a study of Finland's unique data set,"Using data from Finland, this study analyzes the extent to which past returns determine the propensity to buy and sell. It also analyzes whether these differences in past-return-based behavior and differences in investor sophistication drive the performance of various investor types. We find that foreign investors tend to be momentum investors, buying past winning stocks and selling past losers. Domestic investors, particularly households, tend to be contrarians. The distinctions in behavior are consistent across a variety of past-return intervals.

"Eighths, sixteenths, and market depth: changes in tick size and liquidity provision on the NYSE","Using limit order data provided by the NYSE, we investigate the impact of reducing the minimum tick size on the liquidity of the market. While both spreads and depths (quoted and on the limit order book) declined after the NYSE's change from eighths to sixteenths, depth declined throughout the entire limit order book as well. The combined effect of smaller spreads and reduced cumulative limit order book depth has made liquidity demanders trading small orders better off; however, traders who submitted larger orders in lower volume stocks did not benefit, especially if those stocks were low priced.","['Michael A.

The balance of power in closely held corporations,"We analyze a closely held corporation characterized by the absence of a resale market for its shares. We show that the founder of the firm can optimally choose an ownership structure with several large shareholders to force them to form coalitions to obtain control. By grouping member cash flows, a coalition internalizes to a larger extent the consequences of its actions and hence takes more efficient actions than would any of its individual members. The model has implications for the optimal bundling of cash flow and voting rights, and for the optimal number and size of shareholders.","['Morten Bennedsen', 'Daniel Wolfenzon']","['Closely held corporations', 'Ownership structure', 'Control dilution', 'Controlling coalition', 'One-share–one vote']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000684,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
Why firms issue targeted stock,"We analyze market reaction to targeted stock issuances and investigate possible motives for their use. We find a statistically significant abnormal return of 3.61% within a three-day window around the announcement of proposed targeted stock issuances, possibly attributable to greater information on targeted stock segments as well as monitoring and motivational advantages. We find lower tax-loss carry forwards among firms that issue targeted stock compared to those that spin off segments, suggesting that tax reasons motivate targeted stock use. The return and cash flows of targeted stocks are affected more by their common corporate affiliation, although industry influences remain strong.","[""Julia D'Souza"", 'John Jacob']","['Tracking stock', 'Diversification', 'Corporate focus', 'Corporate structure', 'Ownership structure']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000477,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,3
"‘Time to build, option value and investment decisions’: a comment","We correct the analysis of the model of time to build in Majd and Pindyck (1987 Journal of Financial Economics 18, 7–27) for the omission of an essential optimality condition. Our analysis reveals an additional insight: long times to build reduce the effects of increased project value volatility (i.e., higher investment thresholds) in comparison to standard real option models of investment under uncertainty, where investment is instantaneous. Thus, a ‘naı̈ve’ NPV rule can sometimes be an appropriate initial guide to investment.","['Alistair Milne', 'A Elizabeth Whalley']","['Irreversible investment', 'Time to build']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X0000043X,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,2
Indexed executive stock options,"We design and derive a pricing model for an executive stock option with a strike price indexed to a benchmark and investigate its valuation and incentive implications. In both up and down markets, the indexed option filters out common risks beyond the executive's control, thereby increasing the efficiency of incentive contracts. The indexed option has a different payoff structure and much lower initial value than a traditional option. Incentive effects of the indexed option also differ from those of traditional options. We design an optional penalty function to reduce the payoff if executives manipulate specified model parameters such as volatility.","['Shane A Johnson', 'Yisong S Tian']","['Executive stock options', 'Executive compensation', 'Option valuation', 'Indexed options']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000507,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,57,1
"Liquidity, investment ability, and mutual fund structure","We develop a model of the mutual fund industry in which the management fees and loads charged by actively managed open-end funds and average fund returns are determined endogenously in a competitive market setting. It is shown that heterogeneity in managerial skills at investing and minimizing costs, and the existence of investor clienteles with differing liquidity and marketing needs, gives rise to a variety of open-end fund structures that differ in the average return delivered to investors. Managers choose a fund's structure to maximize the rents they capture from their ability, taking into account the effect on investor flows. In equilibrium, funds that constrain liquidity withdrawals may have to charge lower fees and share some profits in the form of higher investor returns, when there is relative scarcity of investors with low liquidity needs.","['Vikram Nanda', 'M.P Narayanan', 'Vincent A Warther']","['Mutual funds', 'Liquidity', 'Loads', 'Fund performance', 'Fund returns']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000635,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,57,3
Abnormal returns to rivals of acquisition targets: A test of the `acquisition probability hypothesis',"We develop and test the Acquisition Probability Hypothesis, which asserts that rivals of initial acquisition targets earn abnormal returns because of the increased probability that they will be targets themselves. On average, rival firms earn positive abnormal returns regardless of the form and outcome of acquisition. These returns increase significantly with the magnitude of surprise about the initial acquisition. Moreover, the cross-sectional variation of rival abnormal returns in the announcement period is systematically related to variables associated with the probability of acquisition. In addition, rivals that subsequently become targets earn significantly higher abnormal returns in the announcement period.","['Moon H Song', 'Ralph A Walkling']","['Acquisition', 'Rivals', 'Tender offer', 'Mergers', 'Collusion']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000483,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,55,2
Universal banking and the performance of German firms,"We empirically investigate the influence of German universal banks on the performance of German firms. We take into account banks’ control rights from equity ownership, banks’ proxy-voting rights, and the concentration of control rights from equity ownership (which includes complex forms such as pyramids, cross-shareholdings, and stocks with multiple votes). We also account for voting restrictions and the German codetermination system (under which employees of large firms have control rights that are unrelated to equity ownership). We find that firm performance improves to the extent that equity control rights are concentrated. Moreover, bank control rights from equity ownership significantly improve firm performance beyond what nonbank blockholders can achieve.","['Gary Gorton', 'Frank A Schmid']","['Corporate control', 'Corporate finance', 'Ownership structure', 'Universal banking']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000660,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
The `repricing’ of executive stock options,"We examine a sample of firms that reset the exercise prices on their executive options. These repricings follow a period of about one year of poor firm-specific performance in which the average firm loses one-fourth of its value. No other offsetting changes to option terms or compensation are made, and many firms reprice more than once. Without repricing, a majority of the options would have been at-the-money within two years. We find that when faced with circumstances in which repricing might be chosen, firms with greater agency problems, smaller size, and insider- dominated boards are more likely to reprice.","['Don M Chance', 'Raman Kumar', 'Rebecca B Todd']","['Executive', 'Option', 'Incentives', 'Repricing']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000532,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,57,1
Managerial discipline and corporate restructuring following performance declines,"We examine the incidence of disciplinary events that reduce the control of current managers, and corporate restructuring among firms experiencing a large decline in operating performance during an active takeover period (1985–1988) and a less active period (1989–1992). We document a significant decline in the disciplinary events from the active to the less active period that is driven by a significant decline in disciplinary takeovers, those takeovers that result in a top executive change. Following the performance decline, however, there is a substantial amount of corporate restructuring, and a significant improvement in operating performance, during both the active and the less active takeover period. We conclude that, although some managerial disciplinary events are related to overall takeover activity, the decline in takeover activity does not result in fewer performance-enhancing restructurings following performance declines.","['David J Denis', 'Timothy A Kruse']","['Management turnover', 'Takeovers', 'Restructuring']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000550,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,55,3
Altering the terms of executive stock options,"We examine the practice of resetting the terms of previously-issued executive stock options. We identify properties of reset options, develop a model for valuing resettable options, and characterize the firms that have reset options. We find the vast majority of options are reset at-the-money, resulting, on average, in the strike price dropping 40%. Our valuation model suggests that resetting has only a small impact on the ex-ante value of an option award, but the ex-post gain can be substantial. Finally, we find resetting has a strong negative relation with firm performance even after correcting for industry performance.","['Menachem Brenner', 'Rangarajan K Sundaram', 'David Yermack']","['Executive stock options', 'Executive compensation', 'Resetting', 'Repricing', 'Valuation']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000520,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,57,1
The separation of ownership and control in East Asian Corporations,"We examine the separation of ownership and control for 2,980 corporations in nine East Asian countries. In all countries, voting rights frequently exceed cash-flow rights via pyramid structures and cross-holdings. The separation of ownership and control is most pronounced among family-controlled firms and small firms. More than two-thirds of firms are controlled by a single shareholder. Managers of closely held firms tend to be relatives of the controlling shareholder's family. Older firms are generally family-controlled, dispelling the notion that ownership becomes dispersed over time. Finally, significant corporate wealth in East Asia is concentrated among a few families.","['Stijn Claessens', 'Simeon Djankov', 'Larry H.P Lang']","['Ownership', 'Control', 'East Asian corporations']",[],2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000672,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,58,1
The value and incentive effects of nontraditional executive stock option plans,"We examine the value and incentive effects of six nontraditional executive stock options: premium options, performance-vested options, repriceable options, purchased options, reload options, and indexed options. With reasonable parameter values, four options have lower value than a traditional option when granted, and large differences in value are evident across the types. Holding option value constant, five options create stronger incentives than traditional options to increase stock price, five create stronger incentives to increase risk, and three create stronger incentives to reduce dividend yield. Changing various option-specific parameters can produce large changes in incentive strengths.","['Shane A. Johnson', 'Yisong S.

"Alternative flotation methods, adverse selection, and ownership structure: evidence from seasoned equity issuance in the U.K.","We examine valuation effects of announcements of seasoned equity issuance and assess the impact of the choice of flotation method in the U.K. Rights offerings are predominant, but in 1986, British firms gained the flexibility to conduct placings, which are comparable to U.S. firm commitment offerings. A placing is a fixed-price bought deal that increases ownership dispersion. Placings generate significantly positive share price effects, whereas rights offerings have large negative valuation effects that become more adverse after 1985. We conclude that the option to conduct placings enhances the ability of firms to signal their quality and to use a seasoned equity offering to reduce ownership concentration.","['M.B Slovin', 'M.E Sushka', 'K.W.L Lai']","['Equity issuance', 'Flotation method', 'Rights offerings', 'Placings', 'Ownership concentration']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000544,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,57,2
Is the abnormal return following equity issuances anomalous?,"We examine whether a distinct equity issuer underperformance anomaly exists. In a sample of initial public offering (IPO) and seasoned equity offering (SEO) firms from 1975 to 1992, we find that underperformance is concentrated primarily in small issuing firms with low book-to-market ratios. SEO firms, that underperform these standard benchmarks have time series returns that covary with factor returns constructed from nonissuing firms. We conclude that the stock returns following equity issues reflect a more pervasive return pattern in the broader set of publicly traded companies.","['Alon Brav', 'Christopher Geczy', 'Paul A.

The cash-flow permanence and information content of dividend increases versus repurchases,"We hypothesize that firms choose dividend increases to distribute relatively permanent cash-flow shocks and repurchases to distribute more transient shocks. As predicted, we find that post-shock cash flows of dividend increasing firms exhibit less reversion to pre-shock levels compared with repurchasing firms. We also examine whether the stock market uses the announcement of the payout method to update its beliefs about the permanence of cash-flow shocks. Controlling for payout size and the market's expectation about the permanence of the cash-flow shock, the stock price reaction to dividend increases is more positive than the reaction to repurchases.","['Wayne Guay', 'Jarrad Harford']","['Payout policy', 'Stock repurchase', 'Buy-back', 'Payout choice', 'Dividend signaling']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X00000623,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,57,3
The relative pricing of U.S. Treasury STRIPS: empirical evidence,"We investigate pricing relations and the potential for arbitrage in the U.S. Treasury STRIPS market, stressing the importance of reconciling quoted Treasury data with actual market pricing conventions. We document that stripping and reconstitution profits in the STRIPS market are fleeting and rarely economically significant; that matched-maturity principal and coupon STRIPS generally have different prices due, at least in part, to richness or cheapness in the underlying note or bond; and that apparent negative forward rates in the STRIPS market are concentrated in certain long-maturity STRIPS that do not actually exist at the time.","['Bradford D Jordan', 'Randy D Jorgensen', 'David R Kuipers']","['Treasury bond', 'Treasury STRIPS', 'Market integration', 'Stripping', 'Reconstitution']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000604,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,56,1
Comparing asset pricing models: an investment perspective,"We investigate the portfolio choices of mean-variance-optimizing investors who use sample evidence to update prior beliefs centered on either risk-based or characteristic-based pricing models. With dogmatic beliefs in such models and an unconstrained ratio of position size to capital, optimal portfolios can differ across models to economically significant degrees. The differences are substantially reduced by modest uncertainty about the models’ pricing abilities. When the ratio of position size to capital is subject to realistic constraints, the differences in portfolios across models become even less important and are nonexistent in some cases.","['Ľuboš Pástor', 'Robert F.

"Value creation and corporate diversification: the case of Sears, Roebuck & Co.","We provide clinical evidence of corporate restructuring at Sears, Roebuck & Co., beginning with the firm's 1981 diversification into financial services by acquiring Coldwell, Banker & Co. and Dean Witter, Reynolds Inc. The initial purchases resulted in a wealth gain to shareholders of approximately $400 million. Anticipated synergies did not materialize, however, and Sears’ retail performance deteriorated. Coincident with pressure from institutional investor activists in 1992, Sears announced the divestiture of financial services and a refocusing on retail operations. This led to a $1.113 billion gain for shareholders. Despite more than $1.5 billion in gains over the entire diversification/divestiture period, Sears’ shareholders suffered a significant opportunity loss when compared with a portfolio of focused firms.","['Stuart L.

Money chasing deals? The impact of fund inflows on private equity valuation,"We show that inflows of capital into venture funds increase the valuation of these funds’ new investments. This effect is robust to (i) controlling for firm characteristics and public market valuations, (ii) examining first differences, and (iii) using inflows into leveraged buyout funds as an instrumental variable. Interaction terms suggest that the impact of venture capital inflows on prices is greatest in states with the most venture capital activity. Changes in valuations do not appear related to the ultimate success of these firms. The findings are consistent with competition for a limited number of attractive investments being responsible for rising prices.","['Paul Gompers', 'Josh Lerner']","['Venture capital', 'Financing']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X99000525,Journal of Financial Economics,2000,55,2
Corporate governance proposals and shareholder activism: the role of institutional investors,"We study shareholder proposals across a period of substantial activity and find systematic differences both across sponsor identity and across time. To measure the success of shareholder activism, we examine voting outcomes and short-term market reactions conditioned on proposal type and sponsor identity. The voting analysis documents that sponsor identity, issue type, prior performance and time period are important influences on the voting outcome. Proposals sponsored by institutions or coordinated groups appear to act as substitutes gaining substantially more support than proposals sponsored by individuals. The nature of the stock market reaction, while typically small, varies according to the issue and the sponsor identity.","['Stuart L. Gillan', 'Laura T.

"Can book-to-market, size and momentum be risk factors that predict economic growth?","We test whether the profitability of HML, SMB, and WML can be linked to future Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Using data from ten countries, we find that HML and SMB contain significant information about future GDP growth. This information is to a large degree independent of that in the market factor. Even in the presence of popular business cycle variables, HML and SMB retain their ability to predict future economic growth in some countries. Our results support a risk-based explanation for the performance of HML and SMB.
