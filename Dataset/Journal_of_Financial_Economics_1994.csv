"The collapse of First Executive Corporation junk bonds, adverse publicity, and the ‘run on the bank’ phenomenon","In April 1991, regulators seized the major subsidiaries of First Executive Corporation (FE), an insurer that invested heavily in junk bonds. During the junk bond market turmoil of 1989–1990, adverse publicity fueled a bank run at FE, forcing a $4 billion portfolio liquidation before the market rose 50–60% in 1991–1992. More traditional insurers did not receive commensurate press coverage, despite their substantial exposure to real estate declines, which were roughly 2.5 times the junk bond decline. Seizure of FE's subsidiaries was defensible, although FE would have become solvent within a year, given average junk bond market appreciation.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo', 'Stuart C Gilson']","['Junk bonds', 'Bank runs', 'Insurance', 'Financial distress', 'Politics of finance']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900086,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,36,3
Voucher privatization,"Several Eastern European countries have initiated mass privatization programs to transfer state-owned assets to the general population. We show that the decision to pursue mass privatization and even the specific design of the programs are largely dictated by politics. Nonetheless, politically feasible programs can also be made attractive from an economic standpoint in terms of maximizing value, fostering free and efficient markets, and promoting corporate governance. In general, the design of economic institutions is critically shaped by political factors, although satisfactory economic results can be achieved in spite of political constraints.","['Maxim Boycko', 'Andrei Shleifer', 'Robert W.

What do firms do with cash windfalls?,"Suppose that a firm receives a cash windfall which does not change its investment opportunity set or, equivalently, its marginal Tobin's Q. What will this firm do with the money? We provide empirical answers to this question using a sample of eleven firms with such windfalls in the form of a won or settled lawsuit. We examine a variety of decisions of the firm to shed light on alternative theories of corporate financing and investment. Our evidence is broadly inconsistent with the perfect capital markets model. The results need to be stretched considerably to fit the asymmetric information model in which managers act in the interest of shareholders. The evidence supports the agency model of managerial behavior, in which managers try to ensure the long-run survival and independence of the firms with themselves at the helm.","['Olivier Jean Blanchard', 'Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes', 'Andrei Shleifer']","['Cash flow', 'Agency theory', 'Lawsuits']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900094,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,36,3
Organizational form and the consequences of highly leveraged transactions: Kroger's recapitalization and Safeway's LBO,"This paper compares the leveraged recapitalization of Kroger Co. with the leveraged buyout of Safeway Stores. While both transactions dramatically increased leverage, Safeway's also altered managerial ownership, board composition, and executive compensation, while Kroger's did not. My analysis suggests that these differences in organizational form lead to large differences in post-HLT restructuring actions and value creation. I conclude that the improved incentive structure and increased monitoring provided by the LBO specialist at Safeway lead managers to generate cash in a more productive manner than the organizational structure employed by Kroger.",['David J.

"The term structure of real interest rates and the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model","This paper estimates real term structures from cross-sections of British government index-linked (‘realrd) bond prices. The Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) model is then fitted to the same data; the model closely approximates the shapes of the directly-estimated term structures. In contrast to similar studies of the nominal term structure, the long-term zero-coupon yield is quite stable, as the CIR model predicts, and in common with previous studies, the level of implied short rate volatility corresponds well with time series estimates. The other parameters, however, are often highly correlated and intertemporal parameter stability is rejected.","['Roger H. Brown', 'Stephen M.

An examination of voluntary versus involuntary security issuances by commercial banks,"This paper examines differences in stock price reactions following voluntary capital injections by commercial banks and involuntary capital injections required to meet regulatory capital requirements. Empirical tests document that stock price declines associated with voluntary common stock issues are significantly greater than those associated with involuntary common stock injections, consistent with Ross (1977). Empirical test also confirm that for both voluntary and involuntary stock issuances, the abnormal stock price reaction is negatively related to the relative size of the offering and positively related to managerial ownership prior to the security issue, although these relationships are stronger for voluntary issues.","['Marcia Millon Cornett', 'Hassan Tehranian']","['Banking', 'Regulation', 'Equity', 'jel', 'G21']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900191,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,35,1
"Financial policy, internal control, and performance Sealed Air Corporation's leveraged special dividend","This paper examines the role of financial policy as a catalyst for organizational change. The subject is Sealed Air Corporation, a company with substantial free cash flow that undertakes a leveraged special dividend. While the stock price response to announcement is typical, Sealed Air exhibits dramatic, sustained, post-dividend performance improvement. Evidence indicates this performance results from managers' conscious and successful use of financial leverage as a tool to disrupt the status quo and promote internal change, including establishing a new objective, changing compensation systems, and reorganizing manufacturing and capital budgeting processes.",['Karen Hopper Wruck'],"['Leverage', 'Dividends', 'Organizations', 'Restructing', 'Financial policy']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9490023X,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,36,2
Venture capitalists and the decision to go public,"This paper examines the timing of initial public offerings and private financings by venture capitalists. Using a sample of 350 privately held venture-backed biotechnology firms between 1978 and 1992, I show that these companies go public when equity valuations are high and employ private financings when values are lower. Seasoned venture capitalists appear to be particularly proficient at taking companies public near market peaks. The results are robust to a variety of controls and alternative explanations.",['Joshua Lerner'],"['Venture capital', 'Initial public offerings', 'Financing strategy']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900353,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,35,3
Appointments of outsiders to Japanese boards: Determinants and implications for managers,This paper investigates the determinants of appointments of outsiders — directors previously employed by banks (bank directors) or by other nonfinancial firms (corporate directors) — to the boards of large nonfinancial Japanese corporations. Such appointments increase with poor stock performance; those of bank directors also increase with earnings losses. Turnover of incumbent top executives increases substantially in the year of both types of outside appointments. We perform a similar analysis for outside appointments in large U.S. firms and find different patterns. We conclude that banks and corporate shareholders play an important monitoring and disciplinary role in Japan.,"['Steven N. Kaplan', 'Bernadette A.

Campeau's acquisition of Federated,"This paper updates Kaplan (1989) by comparing Federated Department Stores' value before its purchase by Campeau Corporation to its post-bankruptcy value. The post-bankruptcy value includes all direct and indirect costs of bankruptcy and financial distress. Federated's assets increased in value by $3.1 billion in 1992 dollars(or $1.6 billion in 1987 dollars). This increase is only slightly below that in Kaplan (1989), suggesting that net bankruptcy costs were modest, and, possibly, nonexistent. The Federated purchase illustrates that a highly-leveraged transaction can increase value, but still be unable to meet its debt obligations; and bankruptcy (and financial distress) need not be costly.",['Steven N.

The nature of information conveyed by pure capital structure changes,"This study investigates the information conveyed by intrafirm exchange offers. I find that leverage increases and leverage decreases convey qualitatively different information. Leverage-increasing offers appear to lower investors' assessment of risk of the firm's common stock, but do not appear to change their expectations of cash flows; leverage-decreasing offers appear to lower investors' expected cash flows, but do not appear to change their assessment of risk. The nature of changes in leverage, capital outlays, and dividends is also asymmetric. Further, I find that, for leverage-increasing offers, corporate control activity does not explain the information content or its asymmetry.",['Kshitij Shah'],"['Capital structure', 'Exchange offers', 'Information', 'Financial distress', 'Corporate control']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900310,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,36,1
Bid-ask spreads in the interbank foreign exchange markets,"This study provides evidence on quotations and bid-ask spreads in the wholesale foreign exchange market, and introduces a method to document variation in the placement of quotes relative to asset value. I find that spreads widen with proxies for inventory-carrying costs, including forecasts of price risk and a measure of liquidity costs. Increases in spreads before nontrading periods can also be attributed to inventory costs. The location of currency quotes in relation to value is not constant, and the outcome of hypothesis tests regarding changes in currency value can be sensitive to allowances for variation in quote location.",['Hendrik Bessembinder'],"['Bid-ask spreads', 'Inventory costs', 'Inventory control', 'Currency markets']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900361,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,35,3
The costs of inefficient bargaining and financial distress,"This study provides the first large-sample analysis of the stock-market reactions to interfirm litigation. When a suit is filed, the common stock of the typical defendant declines by about 1%, while the plaintiff experiences no significant gains. For the average pair of firms, the combined drop in value upon filing is $21 million. Much of the loss is regained if the suit is settled. The findings suggest that bargaining among firm claimants sometimes leads to very inefficient outcomes. Part of the leakage is explained by the costs of increased financial distress imposed on the defendant.","['Sanjai Bhagat', 'James A. Brickley', 'Jeffrey L.

"Markups, quantity risk, and bidding strategies at treasury coupon auctions","This study uses intraday when-issued rate quotes to examine the rewards and risks of the Treasury coupon auctions for bidders who face different tradeoffs between the winner's curse and quantity risk. The data indicate that markups of auction average rates over bid when-issued rates at auction times average 3/8 basis point. I also find that when-issued rates react as strongly to bidding aggressiveness at auctions before the auction results are announced as theydo afterward, and that quantity risk is as important as the winner's curse.",['David P.

Finite sample properties of the generalized method of moments in tests of conditional asset pricing models,"We develop evidence on the finite sample properties of the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) in an asset pricing context. The models imply nonlinear, cross-equation restrictions on predictive regressions for security returns. We find that a two-stage GMM approach produces goodness-of-fit statistics that reject the restrictions too often. An iterated GMM approach has superior finite sample properties. The coefficient estimates are approximately unbiased in simpler models, but their asymptotic standard errors are understated. Simple adjustments for the standard errors are partially successful in correcting the bias. In more complex models the coefficients and their standard errors can be highly unreliable. The power of the tests to reject a single-premium model is higher against a two-premium, fixed-beta alternative than against a conditional Capital Asset Pricing Model with time-varying betas.","['Wayne E.

"Information, trading, and volatility","We examine the effects of trading and information flows on the short-run behavior of stock prices by comparing the behavior of stock return volatility during trading and nontrading periods. We define nontrading periods as periods when exchanges and businesses are open but traders endogenously choose not to trade. After correcting for the bid/ask bounce and stickiness in quotes, we find that a large proportion of daily stock return volatility occurs without trades, especially for large firms. Furthermore, we provide new evidence that public (versus private) information is the major source of short-term return volatility.","['Charles M. Jones', 'Gautam Kaul', 'Marc L.

Does industrial structure explain the benefits of international diversification?,"We examine the influence of industrial structure on the cross-sectional volatility and correlation structure of country index returns for 12 European countries between 1978 and 1992. We find that industrial structure explains very little of the cross-sectional difference in country return volatility, and that the low correlation between country indices is almost completely due to country-specific sources of return variation. Diversification across countries within an industry is a much more effective tool for risk reduction than industry diversification within a country.","['Steven L.

Outside directors and the adoption of poison pills,We find that the average stock-market reaction to announcements of poison pills is positive when the board has a majority of outside directors and negative when it does not. The probability that a subsequent control contest is associated with an auction is also positively related to the fraction of outsiders on the board. These results are largely driven by directors who are retired executives from other companies. The evidence suggests that outside directors serve the interests of shareholders.,"['James A.

Announcements of asset-quality problems and contagion effects in the life insurance industry,We investigate contagion effects in the stock returns of life insurance companies at the time of announcements by First Executive and Travelers of significant problems in their investment portfolios. We first demonstrate that investments in junk bonds or commercial mortgages are important for the shareholder wealth effects of other life insurance companies. We then directly link the shareholder wealth effects to characteristics of firms' customers. Our evidence shows that effects on shareholder wealth are larger for companies with significant junk bond/commercial mortgage assets and readily mobile customers as represented by guaranteed investment contracts (GICs).,"['George W.

A comparison of financial recontracting in distressed exchanges and chapter 11 reorganizations,"We investigate the financial recontracting of firms completing distressed exchanges and those reorganizing under Chapter 11. We find that recovery rates for creditors, on average, are higher in distressed exchanges than in Chapter 11 reorganizations, as are equity deviations from absolute priority. The difference in deviations potentially provides valuable information on the higher costs of formal reorganization. Also, cash is used more extensively to redeem creditors' claims in Chapter 11 than in distressed exchanges. The greater use of cash can be attributed to provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that permit conservation of cash and facilitate asset sales.","['Julian R Franks', 'Walter N Torous']","['Distressed exchanges', 'Chapter 11', 'Equity deviations', 'Bankruptcy costs']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9490037X,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,35,3
How managerial wealth affects the tender offer process,"We present empirical evidence on the relation between changes in managerial wealth and tender offer characteristics. Changes in managerial wealth resulting from a tender offer are negatively related to the likelihood of managerial resistance to a tender offer and positively related to the likelihood of tender offer success. We also document that the abnormal returns to tender offers are lower for hostile than for friendly offers if we control for the tender offer premium. Finally, we find that the top executive gains, whereas outside shareholders do not gain, from management's decision to resist the tender offer.","['James F.

The governance structure of the Japanese financial keiretsu,"We rationalize the cross-holdings of debt and equity within the Japanese keiretsu as a contingent governance mechanism through which internal discipline is sustained over time. The reciprocal allocation of control rights supports cooperation and mutual monitoring among managers through a coalition-enforced threat of removal from control. In financial distress this threat is less effective, and the governance mode shifts to hierarchical enforcement under main bank leadership. The model is consistent with the capital structure, the distribution of claims, the extent of intragroup trading, and patterns of investor intervention within the groups.","['Erik Berglöf', 'Enrico Perotti']","['Corporate governance', 'Financial keiretsu', 'Corporate control']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900264,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,36,2
Aftermarket support and underpricing of initial public offerings,"We study the aftermarket for 72 initial public offerings (IPOs) using comprehensive trade and quote-change data from every market maker for the first three days of trading. Underwriters quote higher bid prices than other market makers for issues that commence trading at or below the offer price. Underwriters repurchase large quantities of stock in the aftermarket without risk by overselling the issue by the amount of the overallotment option. If the IPO is hot, the overallotment option is exercised. If not, the short position is covered with aftermarket selling. We discuss several reasons for underwriter support.","['Paul H.

Foreign ownership restrictions and stock prices in the Thai capital market,"We study the effects of barriers to capital flows using data from the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which segments local and foreign trading of securities that have reached foreign ownership limits. Cross-sectional differences between local and foreign prices are correlated with proxies for the severity of foreign ownership limits, liquidity, and information availability. Time-series variability in the spread between local and foreign returns is consistent with differences in risk exposures and expected risk premiums, suggesting effective capital market segmentation. The results have numerous implications for portfolio and direct investment activity in developing countries.","['Warren Bailey', 'Julapa Jagtiani']","['International asset pricing', 'Segmentation', 'Capital barriers', 'Thailand']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900302,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,36,1
Implied volatility functions in arbitrage-free term structure models,"We test six term structure models in the Heath, Jarrow, and Morton (1992) class using Eurodollar futures and options data from 1987∗1992. We study the time series of implied interest rate volatilities from these models. Using one-day lagged implied volatilities, our one-and two-parameter models simultaneously price an average of 18.5 options each day with an average absolute error of one-and-a-half to two basis points. Although the models fit well, we document systematic strike- price and time-to-maturity biases for all models. We also implement simple trading strategies to test whether the models identify genuine biases.","['Kaushik I. Amin', 'Andrew J.

Cash flow variability and firm's pension choice,"When financial markets are imperfect or financial distress is costly, firms may choose to reduce their risk by lowering financial or operating leverage. This paper examinines the role of operating leverage in the firm's pension choice. Contributions to defined contribution plans are more flexible than contributions to defined benefit plans. Firms may therefore reduce their operating leverage by selecting a defined contribution plan. I find empirical support for this hypothesis which is robust to controls for labor market factors and the continuing trend toward defined contribution pension plans.",['Mitchell A Peterson'],"['Operating leverage', 'Pension', 'Hedging']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94900108,Journal of Financial Economics,1994,36,3
Posted versus effective spreads,"When trades are executed inside the posted bid-ask spread, the posted spread is no longer an accurate measure of transactions costs faced by investors. Using two samples of market orders, one based on orders submitted by retail brokers and one based on orders submitted electronically to the NYSE, we document a significant difference between the posted spread and the effective spread paid by investors. For most orders, the effective spread averages half the posted spread. In addition, when the posted spread widens, only 10 to 22% of the increase appears in the effective spread. These results have significant implications for any empirical work that uses the posted spread as a measure of the cost of trading. Our findings also document a significant difference in the expected execution price across exchanges. This finding is robust to controls for the type of order, and implies that U.S. equity markets are not completely integrated.","['Mitchell A.
