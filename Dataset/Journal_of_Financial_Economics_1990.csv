The numeraire portfolio,"A portfolio formed from a given list of assets is defined as a numeraire portfolio for the list if (a) it is self-financing, (b) its value is always positive, and (c) zero is always the best conditional forecast of the numeraire-dominated rate of return of every asset on the list. The numeraire portfolio exists if and only if there are no profit opportunities from trading assets on the list. For a sample list of heterogeneous assets (NYSE size-quintile portfolios, corporate bonds, and short-term bills), numeraire-dominated returns are similar to market-model forecast errors and, as abnormal return measures, clearly dominate market-adjusted returns.",['John B.

Is corporate bankruptcy efficient?,"Auctions allocate resources to their highest-valued uses. Yet bankruptcy does not use auctions. Instead judges determine a value and parcel out interests on the assumption that this valuation is correct. Errors inevitable in this process lead many persons to conclude that bankruptcy is inefficient. This essay argues that the conclusion does not follow. The costs of error in valuation may be less than the cost of conducting an auction. Legal rules endure because they are efficient or because they transfer wealth. Transfers are an implausible explanation of the current bankruptcy regime, leaving efficiency as the prevailing explanation.",['Frank H.

Consolidating corporate control,"Dual-class recapitalizations and leveraged buyouts have similar effects on ownership of corporate voting rights but very different effects on ownership of residual claims. We predict that firms with greater growth opportunities, lower agency costs, and lower tax liability are more likely to consolidate control through dual-class recapitalizations. We find strong support for the growth hypothesis and weaker support for the other hypotheses. These results increase our understanding of the causes of change in organizational form by illustrating that the method and effects of consolidating corporate control are systematically related to firm attributes.","['Kenneth Lehn', 'Jeffry Netter', 'Annette Poulsen']",[],[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9090067A,Journal of Financial Economics,1990,27,2
Investment-banking contracts in tender offers,"Empirical analysis reveals that investment-banker advisory fees in tender offers average 1.29% of the value of a completed transaction, far below the levels often alluded to in the business press. Most fees are contingent on offer outcome, with target-firm fees typically contingent on transaction value and bidding-firm fees on the number of shares purchased. Although these contingent contracts motivate investment bankers to satisfy some client objectives, many also create conflicts of interest between banker and firm. These incentive problems are apparent in offer evaluation, in hostile offers, and in the price paid by bidding firms.",['Robyn M.

An analysis of exchangeable debt offers,"Exchangeable debt is convertible into the common stock of a target firm in which the issuing firm has an ownership position. It signifies a potential change in the issuing firm's asset composition through the divestiture of the ownership stake in the target firm. We find that announcements of exchangeable debt offers are associated with insignificant abnormal returns for the shareholders of issuing firms. The target firm's share price declines, however, when an exchangeable debt offer is announced. This result is consistent with the offer's potential to reduce the ownership concentration of the target firm's common stock.","['Chinmoy Ghosh', 'Raj Varma', 'J.Randall Woolridge']",[],[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X90900555,Journal of Financial Economics,1990,28,1
Managerial discretion and optimal financing policies,"I analyze financing policies in a firm owned by atomistic shareholders who observe neither cash flows nor management's investment decisions. Management derives perquisites from investment and invests as much as possible. Since it always claims that cash flow is too low fund all positive net present value projects, its claim is not credible when cash flow is truly low. Consequently, management is forced to invest too little when cash flow is low and chooses to invest too much when it is high. Financing policies, by influencing the resources under management's control, can reduce the costs of over- and underinvestment.",['RenéM.

Corporate ownership structure and performance,"I investigate changes in operating performance after 58 management buyouts of public companies completed during 1977–1986. Operating returns increase significantly from the year before to the year after buyouts as measured by operating cash flows (before interest and taxes) per employee and per dollar of operating assets. Subsequent changes in operating returns suggest that this increase is sustained. Adjustments in the management of working capital contribute to the increase in operating returns. The increase is not, however, the result of layoffs or reductions in expenditures for advertising, maintenance and repairs, research and development, or property, plant, and equipment.",['Abbie J.

"Bankruptcy, boards, banks, and blockholders","In 111 publicly traded firms that either file for bankruptcy or privately restructure their debt between 1979 and 1985, bank lenders frequently become major stockholders or appoint new directors. On average, only 46% of incumbent directors remain when bankruptcy or debt restructuring ends. Directors who resign hold significantly fewer seats on other boards following their departure. Common-stock ownership becomes more concentrated with large blockholders and less with corporate insiders. Few firms are acquired.

Political and legal restraints on ownership and control of public companies,"Law and politics affect the financial structure of the public corporation, perhaps as much as economics. Law restricts financial institutions from holding large equity blocks and from networking the small blocks they do own. Impetus for these restrictions came from several sources: a public-spirited belief that financial stability would be fostered by financial fragmentation, American federalism (each state created its own insular set of financial institutions), rivalries between groups of financial institutions, and popular mistrust of powerful private financial institutions. The stability of many of these rules also derives from the political resistance that one would expect corporate managers and benefited financial institutions to offer to any change.",['Mark J Roe'],[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9090019V,Journal of Financial Economics,1990,27,1

The valuation of options on yields,"Many contingent claims incorporate options on yield levels. I derive closed-form expressions for European yield-option prices using a general equilibrium model in which the underlying yield is the relevant state variable. The properties of these options differ markedly from those of conventional options on traded assets. For example, yield-call values can be less than their intrinsic value and can be decreasing functions of the underlying yield. These features have important hedging implications. I examine the empirical implications of the model using price data for the 13-week T-bill options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.",['Francis A.

"Event risk, covenants, and bondholder returns in leveraged buyouts","Prebuyout bondholders, on average, suffer statistically significant wealth losses in leveraged buyouts. Bonds with strong covenant protection, however, gain value, while those with no protection lose value. The disposition of bonds after buyouts, e.g., remained outstanding, called, tendered, defeased, is also strongly linked to type of covenant protection. We also document that covenant use declines for bonds issued after 1980. Finally, the losses to bondholders are small compared with the gains accruing to shareholders.","['Paul Asquith', 'Thierry A.

Dividend yield and expected returns,"Previous research examining the relation between dividend yield and equity returns documents a U-shaped pattern arising from the positive CAPM-adjusted average excess return of zero-dividend firms. In contrast, this paper reports that zero-dividend firms earn negative average excess returns relative to firms of similar size. Despite the apparent conformity of these results to the predictions of after-tax asset pricing models, the negative size-adjusted excess returns cannot be drive solely by tax effects. These excess returns, which are concentrated in the initial zero-dividend years and approach - 1% per month, are attributed to possible dividend-expectation effects rather than taxes.",['William G.

There is little evidence that buyouts lead to widespread employee layoffs, wage reductions, or wealth transfers from bondholders. LBOs continue to be controversial, however. Future research should focus on the effect of buyouts on firms' strategic investments, buyout firms' performance under difficult economic conditions, and the frequency and costs of financial distress associated with buyouts.

Corporate research and development expenditures and share value,"Share-price responses to 95 announcements of increased research and development (R & D) spending are significantly positive on average, even when the announcement occurs in the face of an earnings decline. High-technology firms that announce increases in R & D spending experience positive abnormal returns on average, whereas announcements by low-technology firms are associated with negative abnormal returns. Further, in our cross-sectional analyses we find that higher R & D intensity than the industry average leads to larger stock-price increases only for firms in high-technology industries.","['Su Han Chan', 'John D Martin', 'John W Kensinger']",[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9090005K,Journal of Financial Economics,1990,26,2

We find that prices adjust within at most three trades, with most of the adjustment occurring in the first trade. The temporary price effect for seller-initiated transactions is related to block size, but the temporary price effect observed for buyer-initiated transactions is no larger than that observed in 100 share trades. Most of the price effect associated with block trades is permanent and is related to block size, regardless of the initiating party.","['Robert W. Holthausen', 'Richard W.

How risky is the debt in highly leveraged transactions?,"This paper estimates the systematic risk of the debt in public leveraged recapitalizations. We calculate this risk as a function of the difference in systematic equity risk before and after the recapitalization. The increase in equity risk is surprisingly small after a recapitalization, ranging from 37% to 57%, depending on the estimation method. If total company risk is unchanged, the implied systematic risk of the post-recapitalization debt in twelve transactions averages 0.65. Alternatively, if the entire market-adjusted premium in the leveraged recapitalization represents a reduction in fixed costs, the implied systematic risk of this debt averages 0.40.","['Steven N.

Institutional investment patterns and corporate financial behavior in the United States and Japan,"This paper examines the agency problem between shareholders and debtholders of Japanese and U.S. firms. Whereas U.S. institutional investors are restricted from doing so, Japanese financial institutions take large equity positions in firms to which they lend, particularly in firms more susceptible to the agency problem. Debt ratios of U.S. firms are negatively related to the firm's potential to engage in risky, suboptimal investments, whereas Japanese debt ratios show no such relation. The evidence is consistent with the notion that the agency problem is mitigated to a greater degree in Japan than in the U.S.",['Stephen D.

ESOPs and corporate control,"This paper examines the effects of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) on shareholder wealth. ESOPs established in the presence of takeover activity reduce share values, by approximately 4% on average. ESOPs also reduce share values if they are structured to transfer control away from outside shareholders, by creating a new ownership block with veto power over takeover bids. Large ESOPs established with nonvoting stock, so as to preclude any immediate control transfers, result in a significant increase in share values. The wealth effect of any given ESOP thus depends upon both its incentive and control effects on the corporation.","['Lilli A.

The probability that top executives will resign from or lose outside directorships they already hold is negatively, but not significantly, related to the performance of their own firms.","['Steven N.

"Borrowing relationships, intermediation, and the cost of issuing public securities","This paper investigates how an established borrowing relationship affects the costs associated with initial public offerings of equity. Our model illustrates how the existence of a borrowing relationship reduces the ex ante uncertainty about the value of the issuing firm's equity in the secondary market. If underpricing is related to uncertainty, a borrowing relationship can reduce underpricing. Empirically, we find that, other things equal, IPOs of firms with previously established borrowing relationships are underpriced substantially less than other IPOs.","['Christopher James', 'Peggy Wier']",[],[],November–December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9090051Z,Journal of Financial Economics,1990,28,1
Wealth effects of regulatory reform,"This paper investigates the effect of California's Proposition 103 on the market value of publicly traded property- and liability-insurance companies. The passage of this referendum on November 8, 1988 moved California from a market-oriented to a heavily regulated insurance-pricing system. During the period surrounding the election, the average stock price of insurance companies doing business in California declined by 6.91%. The decline is positively related to the proportion of a firm's premiums affected by the referendum and the proportion generated in other states where insurance regulation is likely to change, and negatively related to the firm's profitability.","['Joseph A.

Point estimates imply that union wealth changes in the six years following the acquisition account for 1% to 2% of shareholder premiums. This figure rises to 5% over 18 years. For hostile takeovers, union wealth increases by roughly 3% and 10% of shareholder gains over 6- and 18-year periods. The 95% confidence interval for wage changes implies that unions may lose up to a quarter, or gain up to a fifth, of what target shareholders gain.",['Joshua G.

In a sample of 169 financially distressed companies, about half successfully restructure their debt outside of Chapter 11. Firms more likely to restructure their debt privately have more intangible assets, owe more of their debt to banks, and owe fewer lenders. Analysis of stock returns suggests that the market is also able to discriminate ex ante between the two sets of firms, and that stockholders are systematically better off when debt is restructured privately.","['Stuart C.

Subordination of American capital,"To economists, agency problems present challenges that can be resolved through optimal contracting or incentive mechanisms. To politicians, agency problems represent entitlements to be allocated among favored constituencies. Corporate management constitutes a powerful constituency independent of the interests of workers, local communities, and other corporate stakeholders. The political process has, for politically rational but economically dabatable reasons, systematically subordinated investors' desire to resolve agency problems to managers' desire to be protected from capital-market discipline.

The relation does not appear in a sample of non-ex-dividend days. These findings indicate that dividend-capture trading affects the ex-day returns of at least some, particularly high-yield, NASDAQ stocks, and that dividend-capture trading is important for understanding ex-dividend-day returns.","['Jonathan M.

We present evidence that Japanese firms with financial structures in which these problems are likely to be small perform better than other firms after the onset of distress. In particular, we show that firms in industrial groups — those with close financial relationships to their banks, suppliers, and customers — invest more and sell more after the onset of distress than nongroup firms.

Until July 1982 OID debt offered large tax advantages. Before that date stock-price responses to announcements of OID debt are significantly positive, in contrast to the negative, albeit insignificant, responses associated with par debt announcements. No stock-price gains are observed for OID debt issued after the tax advantages are removed.

The curve slopes upward until insider ownership reaches approximately 40% to 50% and then slopes slightly downward.

Dividend clienteles and the information content of dividend changes,"We reason that dividend-yield surprises are perfectly correlated with dividend surprises. If investors with preference for dividends are the marginal investors in high-yield stocks, the price reaction to a dividend change should be larger, the higher the anticipated yield of the stock. An examination of over 8,500 dividend changes shows that price reactions to dividend increases are significantly more positive and to dividend decreases significantly more negative for high-yield stocks. Also, the price reactions to dividend changes are larger and the yield effect is stronger for low-priced and small-firm stocks, perhaps because of greater information content and higher transaction costs.","['Mukesh Bajaj', 'Anand M.

Price reversals,"We show that bid-ask errors in transaction prices are the predominant source of apparent price reversals in the short run for NASDAQ firms. Once we extract measurement errors in prices caused by the bid-ask spread, we find little evidence of market overreaction. On the contrary, we find that security returns are positively, and not negatively, autocorrelated. We also show that bid-ask errors lead to substantial spurious volatility in transaction returns; about half of measured daily return variances can be induced by the bid-ask effect.","['Gautam Kaul', 'M.

A comparative analysis of IPO proceeds under alternative regulatory environments,"We study the effect on IPO proceeds of uniform-price restrictions and restrictions on the allocation of oversubscribed issues. Our model suggests that underwriters, given the opportunity to allocate IPOs among both regular and retail investors, would maximize proceeds by using a combination of price and allocation discrimination. Uniform-price restrictions increase the cost of soliciting information from regular investors and, when combined with evenhanded distribution restrictions, make information gathering impossible. We also provide conditions under which either adverse selection or the cost of soliciting information is likely to be the dominant force behind IPO discounting.","['Lawrence M.

Bayesian inference in asset pricing tests,"We test the mean-variance efficiency of a given portfolio using a Bayesian framework. Our test is more direct than Shanken's (1987b), because we impose a prior on all the parameters of the multivariate regression model. The approach is also easily adapted to other problems. We use Monte Carlo numerical integration to accurately evaluate 90-dimensional integrals. Posterior-odds ratios are calculated for 12 industry portfolios from 1926–1987. The sensitivity of the inferences to the prior is investigated by using three different distributions. The probability that the given portfolio is mean-variance efficient is small for a range of plausible priors.","['Campbell R Harvey', 'Guofu Zhou']",[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9090004J,Journal of Financial Economics,1990,26,2
