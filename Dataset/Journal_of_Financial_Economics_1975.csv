"Optimal consumption, portfolio and life insurance rules for an uncertain lived individual in a continuous time model","A continuous time model for optimal consumption, portfolio and life insurance rules, for an investor with an arbitrary but known distribution of lifetime, is derived as a generalization of the model by Merton (1971). The classic Tobin-Markowitz separation theorem obtains with the mutual funds being identical to those obtained under the assumption of certain lifetime. The investor is found to have a ‘human capital’ component of wealth, which is independent of his preferences and risky market opportunities and represents the certainty equivalent of his future net (wage) earnings. Explicit solutions, which are linear in wealth, are found for the investor with constant relative risk aversion.",['Scott F.

Seasonality in Australian capital markets,"Following a report of a possible seasonal in Australian share prices [Praetz (1973)], a study was made of the behaviour of share returns using different data and methodology to that of the original report. The test included forecasts of the seasonal using Box and Jenkins methods. Although the results indicate some evidence of a seasonal, it is shown that this is not prima facie evidence of market inefficiency. It is suggested that a more likely explanation is related to the structure of the economy, e.g., changing opportunity cost of money through the year.",['R.R.

"Cash demand, liquidation costs and capital market equilibrium under uncertainty","In this paper, the portfolio and the liquidity planning problems are unified and analyzed in one model. Stochastic cash demands have a significant impact on both the composition of an individual's optimal portfolio and the pricing of capital assets in market equilibrium. The derived capital asset pricing model with cash demands and liquidation costs shows that both the market price of risk and the systematic risk of an asset are affected by the aggregate cash demands and liquidity risk. The modified model does not require that all investors hold an identical risky portfolio as implied by the Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin model. Furthermore, it provides a possible explanation for the noted discrepancies between the empirical evidence and the prediction of the traditional capital asset pricing model.","['Andrew H.

Delayed risks and risk premiums,"In this paper, two possible premiums for delayed risks are presented and compared. It is shown that one of them possesses some properties usually considered desirable for ‘roulette gambles’ while the other definition does not meet the same requirements. Finally, the response of both premiums to increased wealth is discussed. The analysis of this problem sheds some light on the basic difference between delayed risks and roulette gambles.","['Philippe Caperaa', 'Louis Eeckhoudt']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X75900185,Journal of Financial Economics,1975,2,3
Optimal rules for ordering uncertain prospects,"In this paper, we obtain the optimal selection rule for ordering uncertain prospects for all individuals with decreasing absolute risk averse utility functions. The optimal selection rule minimizes the admissible set of alternatives by discarding, from among a given set of alternatives, those that are inferior (for each utility function in the restricted class) to a member of the given set. We show that the Third Order Stochastic Dominance (TSD) rule is the optimal rule when comparing uncertain prospects with equal means. We also show that in the general case of unequal means, no known selection rule uses both necessary and sufficient conditions for dominance, and the TSD rule may be used to obtain a reasonable approximation to the smallest admissible set. The TSD rule is complex and we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the TSD admissible set. For certain restrictive classes of the probability distributions (of returns on uncertain prospects) which cover most commonly used distributions in finance and economics, we obtain the optimal rule and show that it reduces to a simple form. We also study the relationship of the optimal selection rule to others previously advocated in the literature, including the more popular mean-variance rule as well as the semi-variance rule.",['Vijay S.

Motivating managers to make investment decisions,"Owners of capital frequently lack knowledge about investment opportunities. One alternative is to turn to a manager for assistance. The owner's problem of contracting for the services of a manager is treated as a problem in buying information. The surprising result is that it is sometimes possible to trade information even when the owner is unable to form his own assessment of the information's value. Under some conditions it is possible to write a managerial compensation contract which will induce the manager to act in the best interests of the owner. These conditions require owner knowledge of the manager's employment and investment alternatives and risk preferences as well as some, but not all, of the characteristics of the investment opportunities.",['Donald G.

"Uncertainty, competition, and costs in corporate bond underwriting","The effect of a syndicate's uncertainty regarding the demand for a new bond issue on the syndicate's choice of an offer and bid price, and on the spread between those two prices, is analyzed. Then, the impact of uncertainty on the spread is empirically tested. The hypothesis that the spread varies inversely with the number of bidders for an issue is also developed and tested, and several other hypothesized determinants of the spread are examined.",['Louis H.

On the optimality of international capital market integration,"The focus of this paper is on the benefits to investors, arising out of the integration of the capital markets of different countries. The notion that an expansion in the opportunity set of individual investors causes improvements in their welfare is analyzed to take account of the effects on their wealth. With the supplies of investments held constant, the effects of changes in the macroparameters of the risk-return pricing relationship, caused by the merger of capital markets, on the wealth of individuals in the new equilibrium, are determined. Using three specific utility functions – quadratic, exponential and logarithmic – it is shown that international capital market integration is Pareto-optimal, i.e., the welfare of individuals in the economies considered never declines, and will generally improve. The effect of expansion of the opportunity set, due to the integration of capital markets, nullifies the effect of a possible negative change in wealth.",['Marti G.

Price performance of common stock new issues,"The paper studies both the initial and aftermarket performance (measured by risk-adjusted returns) on newly issued common stocks which were offered to the public during the 1960s. The results confirm that average initial performance is positive (11.4 percent), while the distribution of returns is skewed so that the subscriber of a single random new issue offering has about an equal chance for gain or loss. The results are generally consistent with aftermarket efficiency. Positive initial performance along with aftermarket efficiency indicate that new issue offerings are underpriced. The paper provides insights into this underpricing mystery, but does not solve it.",['Roger G.

Stochastic dominance and portfolio analysis,"The principle of stochastic dominance is used to characterize the optimal efficient sets when the distributions of the random prospects belong to a family. Most of the well-known distributions are considered. In each case, the optimal efficient sets are characterized by easily verifiable conditions on the parameters of the distributions. These optimal efficient sets are then compared with the corresponding mean-variance (MV) efficient set. It is often found that the optimal efficient sets are proper subsets of the MV efficient set. Thus, the MV criterion is a proper efficiency criterion, but the MV efficient set can be excessively large compared to the optimal efficient set.",['Mukhtar M.

Choice over asset economies: Default risk and corporate leverage,"This paper attempts to clarify the apparent conflict between the recent contribution of Stiglitz and Smith (S-S) and the established Modigliani-Miller (M-M) leverage theorem. The two approaches differ in their treatment of asset creation. Whereas M-M restrict their discussion to a given set of competitive asset markets, S-S consider the addition of an extra asset to the original systems.",['Frank Milne'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X75900033,Journal of Financial Economics,1975,2,2
Bank funds management in an efficient market,"This paper discusses general principles for choosing bank assets and liabilities, for deciding on when to make a loan and what interest rate to charge, for pricing funds transfer services such as the handling of checks, for establishing compensating balance requirements, and for dealing with government regulation. The discussion assumes markets are efficient and deals first with an unregulated environment and then with policies in the face of regulatory constraints. Most of the policies which would be optimal in an unregulated environment will be optimal in the regulated environment such as in the U.S. today, because it is relatively easy to get around most of the regulations that are applied to banks by the use of non-deposit liabilities, compensating balances and negative checking accounts.",['Fischer Black'],[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X75900082,Journal of Financial Economics,1975,2,4
Information accuracy and social welfare under homogeneous beliefs,"This paper examines the ‘accuracy’ of information and its effect on social welfare. Information is defined to be more accurate than the existing information if individuals are willing to revise their subjective, homogeneous beliefs based on the new information. In a pure exchange economy where individuals may differ in endowments and tastes, it is shown that, for all utility functions satisfying risk aversion and non-satiation, the receipt of more accurate information does not increase social welfare (in terms of ex-ante Pareto-optimality) even when such information production is costless. This represents a more rigorous analysis on several issues that are not clear in the Marshall (1974) paper. Using the HARA class of utility functions, this paper also addresses the relationship between information and borrowing and lending, and the effect of information on the risk-free rate of interest.",['David S.

Capital asset prices versus time series models as predictors of inflation,"This paper examines the robustness of one month treasury bills as predictors of inflation. The evidence is inconsistent with the joint hypothesis that (1) the expected real rate of interest was constant for one-month bills and (2) that markets are efficient with regard to the time series of inflation. When the expected real rate of interest is set equal to the conditional expectation given the time series of real rates, the results are much more consistent with the efficient markets model. In more positive terms, the failure to confirm market efficiency appears to be the result of naive estimates of the expected real rate.","['Patrick J. Hess', 'James L.

Prediction of return with the minimum variance zero-beta portfolio,This paper tests prediction of returns on stocks using a direct estimate of the minimum variance zero beta portfolio z. The composition of this portfolio is implicit in Black's paper on capital market equilibrium in the absence of riskless borrowing or lending. Portfolios of stocks drawn from the same industries are used to estimate z. The predictions of Black's equilibrium return equation are compared with those of cross-sectional regressions of return on risk.,['I.G.

SEC product-line reporting and market efficiency,"This study tests the efficiency of the securities market with respect to non-public segment earnings data for 1967–1969 which was first made public by many firms in 1970 SEC 10-K reports. Trading rule strategies are proposed in which segment-based earnings forecasts are compared to consolidated-based forecasts to anticipate ‘unexpected’ changes in earnings. Using the ‘market model’ to eliminate market related movements in security prices, average monthly abnormal returns conditional on this segment-based strategy are estimated for 1968, 1969, and 1970 for two groups of firms: (1) ‘Non-disclosure’ firms that did not publicly report either segment revenue or profit data prior to 1970, and (2) ‘partial disclosure’ firms that publicly reported segment revenue information, but no segment profits, prior to 1970.",['Daniel W.
