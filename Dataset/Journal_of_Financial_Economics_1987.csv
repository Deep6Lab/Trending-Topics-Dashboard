Multivariate proxies and asset pricing relations,"A framework is developed in which inferences can be made about the validity of an equilibrium asset pricing relation, even though the central aggregate in this relation is unobservable. A multivariate proxy for the true market portfolio, consisting of an equal-weighted stock index and a long-term government bond index, is employed in an investigation of the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM. The empirical evidence suggests that we can reject the joint hypothesis that (a) CAPM is valid, and (b) multiple correlation between the true market portfolio and proxy assets exceeds 0.7. Connections to the equilibrium factor pricing literature are also explored.",['Jay Shanken'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X87900626,Journal of Financial Economics,1987,18,1
On correlations and inferences about mean-variance efficiency,"A framework is presented for investigating the mean-variance efficiency of an unobservable portfolio based on its correlation with a proxy portfolio. A sensitivity analysis derives the highest correlation between the proxy and a portfolio that reverses the inference of a test of SHarpe-Lintner tangency. For example, the maximum correlation between the value-weighted NYSE-AMEX portfolio and a portfolio inferred tangent ranges from 0.76 to 0.48. We also test whether the correlation between the proxy and the tangent portfolio exceeds a given level. This hypothesis is often rejected for the NYSE-AMEX proxy at a correlation of 0.7.","['Shmuel Kandel', 'Robert F.

"Target abnormal returns associated with acquisition announcements: Payment, acquisition form, and managerial resistance","Abnormal returns earned by target firms at the time of initial acquisition announcements are related to form of payment, degree of resistance, and type of offer. Results indicate that interdependence among these characteristics is important. Previous research suggests that tender-offer targets earn higher abnormal returns than merger targets. After controlling for payment method and degree of resistance, however, the difference in abnormal returns between tender offers and mergers is insignificant. Resisted offers are associated with insignificantly higher returns than unresisted offers. Abnormal returns associated with cash offers are significantly higher than those associated with stock offers.","['Yen-Sheng Huang', 'Ralph A.

Firm value and seasoned equity issues,"Announcements of new equity issues have been seen to have a negative effect on stock prices. Potential explanations of this negative effect - the price-pressure, wealth-redistribution, and information-release hypotheses - imply different bond-price reactions to the announcements. By investigating bond-price behavior around the announcement of new equity issues this paper distinguishes the relative importance of these hypotheses. The evidence presented of a significant drop in bond prices is consistent with the information-release hypotheses.","['Avner Kalay', 'Adam Shimrat']",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X87900316,Journal of Financial Economics,1987,19,1
Shark repellents and stock prices,"Antitakeover amendments (shark repellents) restrict the transfer of corporate control. On average, the public announcement of antitakeover amendments by 600 firms in the period 1979–1985 has an insignificant effect on the value of announcing firms' shares. However, different types of amendments have varying effects. Non-fair-price amendments have an average significant negative effect of 2.95% on share prices, while fair-price amendments have an insignificant effect. The more harmful amendments have larger insider holdings and lower institutional holdings, suggesting a partial explanation of why shareholders approve these amendments.","['Gregg A.

The creation of a class of limited voting common stock and shareholder wealth,"Common stock with limited voting rights changes managerial incentives by allowing managers to separate ownership of equity from ownership of votes. This study compares managerial ownership before and after the creation of a class of limited voting common stock by 44 publicly traded firms between 1962 and 1984, and examines whether the event affects the wealth of current shareholders. There is no evidence that current shareholders are harmed by the creation of limited voting common stock.",['M.Megan Partch'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X87900432,Journal of Financial Economics,1987,18,2
Non-stationarity and stage-of-the-business-cycle effects in consumption-based asset pricing relations,"Empirical tests of Euler equations relating security returns and consumption usually appear to reject the model. Using a common specification of aggregate preferences and instrumental variables, this paper examines some potential reasons for rejections. The evidence indicates that maintained stationarity assumptions of previous tests fail for post-war U.S. quarterly and monthly data. Shifts in model parameters are found across policy regimes (pre-1951 and post-1979) and across stages of the business cycle (recession versus non-recession). Controlling for some of these factors, less evidence is found against a simple consumption-based asset pricing model in non-recession periods.","['Wayne E. Ferson', 'John J.

The monotonicity of the term premium,"Fama's evidence that the term premium on Treasury securities is not monotonically increasing is found to depend entirely on the behavior of bid-asked mean returns on 9- and 10-month bills, and only during the subperiod 8/64–12/72. When transactions costs, as reflected in the bid-asked spread, are taken into account, there is found to be no way to exploit this non-monotonicity. The anomalous behavior of the quotations is attributed to the Treasury's auctions of 9-month bills during the period 9/66–10/72. The hypothesis that the term premium is a monotonically increasing function of maturity remains unrefuted.",['J.Huston McCulloch'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X87900687,Journal of Financial Economics,1987,18,1
Stock returns and the term structure,"In monthly U.S. data for 1959–1979 and 1979–1983, the state of the term structure of interest rates predicts excess stock returns, as well as excess returns on bills and bonds. This paper documents this fact and uses it to examine some simple asset pricing models. In 1959–1979, the data strongly reject a single-latent-variable specification of predictable excess returns. There is considerable evidence that conditional variances of excess returns change through time, but the relationship between conditional mean and conditional variance is reliably positive only at the short end of the term structure.",['John Y.

An empirical analysis of the incentives to engage in costly information acquisition,"In order for security prices to be informationally efficient, incentives must exist for traders to engage in costly information acquisition. This paper provides empirical evidence on this proposition. We observe that risk arbitrageurs (i.e., market participants who trade in securities of firms that are involved in mergers, tender offers, and voluntary liquidations) are able to generate private information regarding the success or failure of corporate reorganizations. Moreover, risk arbitrageurs earn substantial returns on their trading activities. These results suggest that security prices are sufficiently noisy to create incentives for costly information acquisition.","['David F.

Testing for market timing ability,In this paper we examine the Henriksson-Merton test of market timing and its potential usefulness in evaluating investment advice. The paper proposes a natural extension of the test that is valid under more general assumptions about the distribution of asset returns.

"Time to build, option value, and investment decisions","Investment decisions and outlays are often made sequentially. For example, the rate at which construction proceeds is usually flexible and can be adjusted with the arrival of new information. Traditional discounted cash flow methods which treat the pattern of investment as fixed ignore this flexibility and understate the value of the project. This paper uses contingent claims analysis to derive optimal decision rules and to value such investments. We determine the effects of time to build, opportunity cost and uncertainty on the investment decision. For reasonable parameter values, we show how a simple NPV rule can lead to gross errors.","['Saman Majd', 'Robert S.

The distribution of earnings news over time and seasonalities in aggregate stock returns,"Over the past 55 years returns on stock market indexes have on average been higher during the first half-month of calendar quarters 2 through 4 than at other times. Coincidentally, aggregate corporate earnings news arriving at the market during these half-month periods tends to be good, whereas earnings reports arriving later are more likely to convey bad news. In addition firms tend to publish bad-news earnings reports on Mondays, coincident with negative Monday effects in stock returns. The coincidence of earnings news arrival and market seasonalities leads to conjectures about informational reasons for observed seasonalities.",['Stephen H.

The wealth effects of company initiated management changes,"The essence of corporate control includes the hiring and firing of key managers. We examine changes in equity values when the Board of Directors appoints and dismisses top-level managers. The evidence suggests that management changes signal shifts in company policy and raise shareholder wealth, internal promotions confirm the soundness of investment by large companies in firm-specific human capital while external appointments do not, promotions occur more often than external appointments but decline in importance as firm size decreases, and dismissal is not a favored means to handle managerial underperformance but is associated with stock price increases when used.","['Eugene P.H.

A Bayesian approach to testing portfolio efficiency,"This paper develops a Bayesian test of portfolio efficiency and derives a computationally convenient posterior-odds ratio. The analysis indicates that significance levels higher than the traditional 0.05 level are recommended for many test situations.

The effect of large block transactions on security prices: A cross-sectional analysis,"This paper documents the effects of large (block) transactions on the prices of common stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. We examine whether mean temporary and permanent price effects associated with large and small transactions differ and whether the price effects vary cross-sectionally according to the size of the block. Alternative definitions of block size are investigated – percentage of the equity traded, block volume in relation to normal trading volume, and dollar value of the block. The results suggest that price effects are predominantly temporary for seller-initiated transactions and permanent for buyer-initiated transactions.","['Robert W. Holthausen', 'Richard W.

On multivariate tests of the CAPM,"This paper evaluates the power of multivariate tests of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The results indicate that when employing an unspecified alternative hypothesis, the ability of the tests to distinguish between the CAPM and other pricing models is poor.

This upper bound explains the low power of the tests.",['A.Craig MacKinlay'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X87900444,Journal of Financial Economics,1987,18,2
Voluntary corporate liquidations,"This paper examines possible motives for and consequences of voluntary corporate liquidations. Specifically, the procedural and tax differences between voluntary liquidations and other control-changing transaction devices are analyzed. An empirical investigation of successful liquidations shows that the announcement of liquidation reduces the risk of liquidating shares, that the shareholders receive substantial gains from successful liquidations, and that the average gains to the acquiring shareholders are not significantly different from zero. These findings suggest that the liquidating firms' assets have been underutilized before liquidation and that voluntary liquidations lead to higher-valued reallocations of corporate resources.","['E.Han Kim', 'John D.

Expected stock returns and volatility,This paper examines the relation between stock returns and stock market volatility. We find evidence that the expected market risk premium (the expected return on a stock portfolio minus the Treasury bill yield) is positively related to the predictable volatility of stock returns. There is also evidence that unexpected stock market returns are negatively related to the unexpected change in the volatility of stock returns. This negative relation provides indirect evidence of a positive relation between expected risk premiums and volatility.,"['Kenneth R. French', 'G.William Schwert', 'Robert F.

Stock returns and inflation,"This paper hypothesizes that the relation between stock returns and inflation is caused by the equilibrium process in the monetary sector. More importantly, these relations vary over time in a systematic manner depending on the influence of money demand and supply factors. Post-war evidence from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany indicates that the negative stock return-inflation relations are caused by money demand and counter-cyclical money supply effects. On the other hand, pro-cyclical movements in money, inflation, and stock prices during the 1930's lead to relations which are either positive or insignificant.",['Gautam Kaul'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X87900419,Journal of Financial Economics,1987,18,2
"Price, trade size, and information in securities markets","This paper investigates the effect of trade size on security prices. We show that trade size introduces an adverse selection problem into security trading because, given that they wish to trade, informed traders perfer to trade larger amounts at any given price. As a result, market makers' pricing strategies must also depend on trade size, with large trades being made at less favorable prices. Our model provides one explanation for the price effect of block trades and demonstrates that both the size and the sequence of trades matter in determining the price-trade size relationship.","['David Easley', ""Maureen O'Hara""]",[],[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X87900298,Journal of Financial Economics,1987,19,1
Constraints on short-selling and asset price adjustment to private information,"This paper models effects of short-sale constraints on the speed of adjustment (to private information) of security prices. Constraints eliminate some informative trades, but do not bias prices upward. Prohibiting traders from shorting reduces the adjustment speed of prices to private information, especially to bad news. Non-prohibitive costs can have the reverse effect, but this is unlikely. Implications are developed about return distributions on information announcement dates. Periods of inactive trade are shown to impart a downward bias to measured returns. An unexpected increase in the short-interest of a stock is shown to be bad news.","['Douglas W. Diamond', 'Robert E.

Together, these costs average 21.22% of the realized market value of the securities issued for firm commitment offers and 31.87% for best efforts offers. For a given size offer, the direct expenses are of the same order of magnitude for both contract types, but the underpricing is greater for best efforts offers. An explanation of why some firms choose to use best efforts offers in spite of their apparent higher total costs is given.",['Jay R.

Semi-parametric upper bounds for option prices and expected payoffs,"Upper bounds on the expected payoff of call and put options are derived. These bounds depend only on the mean and variance of the terminal stock price and not on its entire distribution, so they are termed semi-parametric. A corollary of this result is a set of upper bounds for option prices obtained by the risk-neutral valuation approach of Cox and Ross. As an example, these bounds are shown to obtain across both lognormal diffusions and mixed diffusion-jump processes for any given data set.

The market for interfirm asset sales,"We investigate the valuation consequences of voluntary proposals to sell part or all of a corporation's assets. For partial sell-offs, successful sellers and buyers reap statistically significant abnormal returns of 1.66% and 0.83%, respectively. Unsuccessful sellers realize gains at the bid announcement of 1.41% that are lost at the offer termination. In contrast, proposals to liquidate the firm are associated with significant average abnormal returns of 12.24%. We interpret these findings as evidence that asset sales are associated with the movement of resources to higher-valued uses rather than as evidence of market mispricing before the divestiture announcements.","['Gailen L.

Subperiod aggregation and the power of multivariate tests of portfolio efficiency,"When testing portfolio efficiency, empiricists usually perform tests using subperiods and aggregate the results in some manner. Although the power of individual subperiod tests has been studied previously, little is known about the power of the aggregate test. Power is evaluated here through simulations using two different aggregation techniques. Aggregate power is substantially higher than that for a single subperiod. For example, in one scenario the aggregate power is 0.77 over a sixty-year period, but only 0.17 for each five-year subperiod. In addition, the level of power depends on the method of aggregation.","['Michael R.
