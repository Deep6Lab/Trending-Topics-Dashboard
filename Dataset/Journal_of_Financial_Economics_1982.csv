Consumption correlatedness and risk measurement in economies with non-traded assets and heterogeneous information,"A technique is presented for deriving equilibrium models of asset risk premia in continuous time models which does not require the complete solution of a consumer's continuous time stochastic control problem. The technique is used to show that even if traders have heterogeneous information about asset returns and/or there are non-traded assets, then the risk premium of a traded asset is determined by the covariance between the asset's return and the rate of change in per capita consumption. We only require the assumption that traders' consumptions and traded asset values form an Ito process.","['Sanford J. Grossman', 'Robert J.

Multivariate tests of financial models,"A variety of financial models are cast as nonlinear parameter restrictions on multivariate regression models, and the framework seems well suited for empirical purposes. Aside from eliminating the errors-in-the-variables problem which has plagued a number of past studies, the suggested methodology increases the precision of estimated risk premiums by as much as 76%. In addition, the approach leads naturally to a likelihood ratio test of the parameter restrictions as a test for a financial model. This testing framework has considerable power over past test statistics. With no additional variable beyond β, the substantive content of the CAPM is rejected for the period 1926–1975 with a significance level less than 0.001.",['Michael R.

Do forecast errors or term premia really make the difference between long and short rates?,"Forward rates in the term structure of interest contain predictions of future spot rates plus (possibly) term premia. Realized spot rates contain predicted spot rates plus forecast errors. Under rational expectations forecast errors are not predictable. By forecasting spot rates using publicly available information, bounds on the variation of forecast errors, and term premia are obtained. For one-month treasury bill rates, one to two thirds of the variation in the difference between forward rates and realized spot rates is due to variation in term premia.",['Richard Startz'],[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X82900058,Journal of Financial Economics,1982,10,3
Racetrack betting and informed behavior,"Horse racing data permit interesting tests of attitudes toward risk. The present paper studies a new sample of racetrack results from Atlantic City, New Jersey. The questions examined are: (1) Are the market odds the best data for predicting the order of finish? (2) Do horses go off at odds that reflect their true probability of winning? (3) Is there any evidence that late bettors have better information than early bettors? It is found that market odds predict the order of finish well, but that ‘favorites’ are good bets and ‘long shots’ are poor ones. The data suggest that there does exist an ‘informed’ class of bettors and that bettors are on the whole neither risk neutral nor risk averse.","['Peter Asch', 'Burton G. Malkiel', 'Richard E.

Determinants of corporate borrowing,"In his article Determinants of Corporate Borrowing, Myers (1977) says that it is not guaranteed that the maximum value of the firm is reached before the maximum value of the debt is utilized in the case in which the interest payment is fully tax deductible, but the tax shield is lost if the firm goes bankrupt. I have shown here that even in such a case the maximum value of the firm will always be achieved before the maximum available debt is utilized.",['Keshav Gupta'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X82900332,Journal of Financial Economics,1982,10,1
The effect of temporal risk aversion on liquidity preference,"In most instances, investors are not indifferent to risk. Their attitudes toward it influence their decisions. Temporal risk aversion, the dynamic analogue of the usual concept of risk aversion, has a marked effect on investors' decisions but is usually ignored in the literature. This paper investigates the liquidity preference of temporally risk-averse investors. The analysis shows that, all other things being equal, temporal risk aversion reduces the liquidity premium investors must receive to hold an asset that is not perfectly reversible. Thus, the optimal investment policy is closer to what one would expect had a frictionless exchange market existed for the irreversible asset. As far as an individual's investment behavior is concerned, temporal risk aversion counters the effects of an asset's irreversibility and tends to compensate for the absence of frictionless exchange.",['Gyorgy G.

Spot and forward rates in the Canadian treasury bill market,"The efficiency of the Canadian Treasury bill market is examined with data on spot and forward rates of return. Over the period from 7/62 to 3/79, the bill market has been efficient in the sense that it correctly uses the information contained in past spot rates in assessing the expected future spot rate and in determining the forward rate. Moreover, the forward rate is found to contain some information about future spot rates above and beyond that in past spot rates.",['Soo-Bin Park'],[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X82900320,Journal of Financial Economics,1982,10,1
The effect of discretionary price control decisions on equity values,"The macro literature presents conflicting evidence on the effects of price controls. In this study, the fact that the macro-economic effect of wage and price controls is the aggregation of the micro-economic effects is used to implement a different approach to measure the effects of price controls. The effect of price controls is inferred from examining the impact of discretionary regulatory decisions on the equity values of individual firms during Phase II of Nixon's Economic Stabilization Program. The empirical results indicate that violators of the regulations incurred significant abnormal losses that were unrelated to the explicit penalties. This suggests that implicit penalties were imposed on offending firms. The analysis of price increase decisions provides weak evidence that these Price Commission decisions had an impact on equity values.",['Richard S.

The value line enigma (1965–1978),The performance of Value Line Investment Survey recommendations made between 1965 and 1978 is evaluated by applying a future benchmark technique. The future benchmark technique avoids selection bias problems associated with using historic benchmarks as well as known difficulties of using Capital Asset Pricing Model benchmarks. Potential problems (implicit in the technique) are discussed and resolved within the conduct of the experiment. Results indicate statistically significant abnormal performance when future benchmarks are computed using a market model.,"['Thomas E.

Potential performance and tests of portfolio efficiency,"The potential performance of an asset set may be obtained by choosing the portfolio proportions to maximize the Sharpe (1966) performance measure. If a portfolio has a Sharpe measure equivalent to the potential performance of the underlying set of assets, then it is efficient. Multivariate statistical procedures for comparing potential performance and testing portfolio efficiency are developed and then evaluated using simulations. Two likelihood ratio statistics are then used to compare stock and bond indices against sets of 20 and 40 portfolios. The procedures are also compared to the Gibbons (1982) methodology for testing financial models.","['J.D.

Empirical anomalies based on unexpected earnings and the importance of risk adjustments,"The purpose of this paper is to reexamine Reinganum's study which indicates that abnormal returns could not be earned unexpected quarterly earnings information, and to document precisely the response of stock prices to earnings announcements. This study, using a very large sample of stocks and daily returns, represents the most complete and detailed analysis of quarterly earnings reports that has been performed to date. Our results are contrary to those of Reinganum and show that abnormal returns could have been earned almost any time during the 1970's. Our analysis also indicates that risk adjustments matter little in this type of work. Finally, we find that roughly 50% of the adjustment of stock returns to unexpected quarterly earnings occurs over a 90-day period after the earnings are announced.","['Richard J.

Tax-induced clientele effects in the market for British government securities,"This paper develops a new methods for measuring tax effects in bond markets and presents empirical results for British Government Securities. The basic idea is to construct a least cost portfolio which, for investors in a given tax bracket, dominates a given bond. A portfolio is said to dominate a bond if it provides cash flows which are at least as great in every period, and has a lower price. In effect our method calculates an upper bound on the value of a bond to investors in a given tax bracket. The results demonstrate (i) the existence of clientele effects and (ii) the absence of an ‘effective tax rate’.",['Stephen M.

Stockholder-bondholder conflict and dividend constraints,"This paper examines a large, randomly chosen, sample of bond indentures focusing on the constraints they set on dividend payments that have the potential to transfer wealth from the bondholders (i.e., payments which are financed by a new debt issue or reduced investment). The nature of these restrictions support the hypothesis that bond convenants are structured to control the conflict of interest between stockholders and bondholders. Further, the empirical evidence suggests that these constraints are not binding — i.e., stockholders do not pay themselves as much dividends as they are allowed to. Explanations of this puzzling empirical regularity are suggested.",['Avner Kalay'],[],[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X82900149,Journal of Financial Economics,1982,10,2
Bond indenture provisions and the risk of corporate debt,"This paper examines the effect of alternative bond indenture provisions on the allocation of risk among the firm's claimants. The approach taken here differs from that of earlier studies in that risk allocation is examined while the firm's leverage (in market value terms) is held constant. In this context, four indenture provisions are examined: (1) the time to maturity, (2) the promised payment schedule, (3) financing restrictions and (4) priority rules. It is concluded that risk is transferred from stockholders to bondholders as the time to maturity and promised payment increase appropriately. Furthermore substitution of longer-term debt for an equal amount of shorter-term debt also increases the risk to bondholders while decreasing the risk to stockholders. The analysis shows that a coupon bond can be represented by a unique discount bond with the same risk and value. This permits the characterization of the effective maturity of a risky debt issue, a concept analogous to the stochastic duration of a default-free coupon bond. These results are shown to be independent of the means used to finance the debt issue. Finally, it is concluded that the relative risk associated with different bonds issued by the same firm cannot be determined by the structure of priority rules alone. It is also necessary to consider the timing of the promised payments compared to that of the other debt issues in the firm's capital structure.","['Thomas S.Y. Ho', 'Ronald F.

An analysis of revolving credit agreements,"This paper examines the pricing of intermediate-term line commitments, often called revolving credit agreements. Their characteristics, covenant, and compensating balance features are discussed. The fixed portion of the line is described as a dual phased option; it behaves as a put or a call depending on whether bank borrowing is undertaken. Two valuation models, based on the use of the borrowing, are derived for infinitely-lived line commitments. The pattern of borrowing by the firm is shown to principally depend on the relative size of the fixed and variable costs of the line.",['Gregory D.

Valuation of American call options on dividend-paying stocks,"This paper examines the pricing performance of the valuation equation for American call options on stocks with known dividends and compares it with two suggested approximation methods. The approximation obtained by substituting the stock price net of the present value of the escrowed dividends into the Black-Scholes model is shown to induce spurious correlation between prediction error and (1) the standard deviation of stock return, (2) the degree to which the option is in-the-money or out-of-the-money, (3) the probability of early exercise, (4) the time to expiration of the option, and (5) the dividend yield of the stock. A new method of examining option market efficiency is developed and tested.",['Robert E.

The stochastic behavior of common stock variances,"This paper examines the relation between the variance of equity returns and several explanatory variables. It is found that equity variances have a strong positive association with both financial leverage and, contrary to the predictions of the options literature, interest rates. To a substantial degree, the negative elasticity of variance with respect to value of equity that is part of market folklore is found to be attributable to financial leverage. A maximum likehood estimator is developed for this elasticity that is substantially more efficient than extant estimation procedures.",['Andrew A.

Comments on the valuation of derivative assets,"This paper presents an alternative approach to derive the Breeden-Litzenberger valuation formula, which expresses the price of an arbitrary derivative security in terms of call options' prices. This valuation formula follows from the observation that a continuous derivative security can be replicated by a portfolio including a bond and call options with all possible exercise prices. Discrete terms are added to the original Breeden-Litzenberger formula to reflect possible discontinuities of the call option price's derivative with respect to the exercise price. These discontinuities are subsequently shown to correspond to mass points of the probability distribution of the stock price. Several applications of the Breeden-Litzenberger valuation formula are demonstrated.",['Avi Bick'],[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8290006X,Journal of Financial Economics,1982,10,3
Options on the minimum or the maximum of two risky assets,"This paper provides analytical formulas for European put and call options on the minimum or the maximum of two risky assets. The properties of these formulas are discussed in detail. Options on the minimum or the maximum of two risky assets are useful to price a wide variety of contingent claims of interest to financial economists. Applications discussed in this paper include the valuation of foreign currency debt, option-bonds, compensation plans, risk-sharing contracts, secured debt and growth opportunities involving mutually exclusive investments.",['RenéM.

On the exclusion of assets from tests of the two-parameter model,"This study investigates the sensitivity of tests of the CAPM to different sets of asset returns. Tests are conducted with market portfolios that include returns for bonds, real estate, and consumer durables in addition to common stocks. Even when stocks represent only 10% of the portfolio's value, inferences about the CAPM are virtually identical to those obtained with a stocks-only portfolio. In contrast, inferences are sensitive to the set of assets used in the tests.",['Robert F Stambaugh'],[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X82900022,Journal of Financial Economics,1982,10,3
Approximate option valuation for arbitrary stochastic processes,"We show how a given probability distribution can be approximated by an arbitrary distribution in terms of a series expansion involving second and higher moments. This theoretical development is specialized to the problem of option valuation where the underlying security distribution, if not lognormal, can be approximated by a lognormally distributed random variable. The resulting option price is expressed as the sum of a Black-Scholes price plus adjustment terms which depend on the second and higher moments of the underlying security stochastic process. This approach permits the impact on the option price of skewness and kurtosis of the underlying stock's distribution to be evaluated.","['Robert Jarrow', 'Andrew Rudd']",[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X82900071,Journal of Financial Economics,1982,10,3
