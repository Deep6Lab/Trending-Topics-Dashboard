Multifactor models do not explain deviations from the CAPM,"A number of studies have presented evidence rejecting the validity of the Sharpe-Lintner capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Possible alternatives include risk-based models, such as multifactor asset pricing models, or nonrisk-based models which address biases in empirical methodology, the existence of market frictions, or the presence of irrational investors. Distinguishing between the alternatives is important for applications such as cost of capital estimation. This paper develops a framework which shows that, ex ante, CAPM deviations due to missing risk factors will be very difficult to detect empirically, whereas deviations resulting from nonrisk-based sources are easily detectable. The results suggest that multifactor pricing models alone do not entirely resolve CAPM deviations.",['A.Craig MacKinlay'],"['Capital asset pricing model', 'Data snooping', 'Market frictions', 'Multifactor models']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400808E,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,38,1
"Executive compensation structure, ownership, and firm performance","An examination of the executive compensation structure of 153 randomly-selected manufacturing firms in 1979–1980 provides evidence supporting advocates of incentive compensation, and also suggests that the form rather than the level of compensation is what motivates managers to increase firm value. Firm performance is positively related to the percentage of equity held by managers and to the percentage of their compensation that is equity-based. Moreover, equity-based compensation is used more extensively in firms with more outside directors. Finally, firms in which a higher percentage of the shares are held by insiders or outside blockholders use less equity-based compensation.",['Hamid Mehran'],"['Compensation structure', 'Ownership', 'Directors', 'Blockholders']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400809F,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,38,2
An analysis of value destruction in AT&T's acquisition of NCR,"AT&T's $7.5 billion acquisition of NCR decreased the wealth of AT&T shareholders by between $3.9 billion and $6.5 billion and resulted in negative synergies of $1.3 to $3.0 billion. We find that AT&T paid a documented $50 million and possibly as much as $500 million to satisfy pooling accounting, thus boosting EPS by roughly 17% but leaving cash flows unchanged. We conclude that AT&T's decision to acquire NCR in what the market perceived as a value-destroying transaction was related at least in part to the 1984 consent decree with the Department of Justice that led to the break-up of AT&T.","['Thomas Lys', 'Linda Vincent']","['Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'Purchase', 'Pooling']",[],October–November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500831X,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,39,2
Tests of microstructural hypotheses in the foreign exchange market,"Data in this paper support both the inventory-control and asymmetric-information approaches to microstructure theory. Strong evidence of an inventory-control effect on price is new. The transactions dataset chronicles a trading week of a spot foreign exchange dealer whose daily volume averages over $1 billion. In addition to controlling inventory with his own price, the dealer also lays off inventory at other dealers' prices and through brokers.

Corporate focus and stock returns,"Greater corporate focus is consistent with shareholder wealth maximization. Diseconomies of scope in the 1980s are confirmed by a trend towards focus or specialization, a positive relation between stock returns and focus increases, and the failure of diversified firms to exploit financial economies of scope (coinsurance of debt or reliance on internal capital markets). Large focused firms were less likely to be subject to hostile takeover attempts than were other firms, but diversified firms were distinguished in the 1980s mostly by being relatively active participants, as both buyers and sellers, in the market for corporate control.","['Robert Comment', 'Gregg A.

"Incentives, downsizing, and value creation at general dynamics","In 1991, defense contractor General Dynamics engaged a new management team which adopted an explicit corporate objective of creating shareholder value. The company tied executive compensation to shareholder wealth creation, and subsequently implemented a strategy that included downsizing, restructuring, and exit. Paying large executive cash bonuses amid layoffs ignited controversy. However, by 1993 shareholders realized gains approaching $4.5 billion, representing a dividend-reinvested return of 553%. The study shows how incentives assist in shaping strategy, illustrates the political costs and economic benefits of downsizing and demonstrates that even firms in declining industries have substantial opportunities for value creation.","['Jay Dial', 'Kevin J.

Aggregate mutual fund flows and security returns,"In this paper I find that aggregate security returns are highly correlated with concurrent unexpected cash flows into mutual funds, but unrelated to concurrent expected flows. An unexpected inflow equal to 1% of total stock fund assets ($4.75 billion) corresponds to a 5.7% increase in the stock price index. Further, fund flows are correlated with the returns of the securities held by the funds, but not with the returns of other types of securities.

Stock returns and volatility a firm-level analysis,"It has been previously documented that individual firms' stock return volatility rises after stock prices fall. This paper finds that this statistical relation is largely due to a positive contemporaneous relation between firm stock returns and firm stock return volatility. This positive relation is strongest for both small firms and firms with little financial leverage. At the aggregate level, the sign of this contemporaneous relation is reversed. The reasons for the difference between the aggregate- and firm-level relations are explored.",['Gregory R.

A reexamination of option values implicit in callable Treasury bonds,"Longstaff (1992) and Edleson, Fehr, and Mason (1993) examine option values implicit in callable Treasury bonds and report a significant puzzle: implied option values are frequently negative. Using an alternative approach, we reexamine this issue and find that implied option values are generally positive, and, in contrast to previous studies, instances of option values sufficiently negative to overcome the bid-ask spread are rare. We explain the findings in other studies by showing that the method used may lead to the appearance of a negative option value when the true value is positive.","['Bradford D. Jordan', 'Susan D.

The Nestlé crash,"On November 17, 1988, the board of directors of Nestlé AG decided to allow foreign investors to hold Nestlé registered stock, reversing a longstanding practice. This decision had a tremendous impact on the prices of the firm's three classes of common stock, as well as on the prices of several other corporations traded on the Zürich stock exchange.

The use of warrants as underwriter compensation in initial public offerings,"Previous research suggests that offering costs are higher when warrants are used to compensate underwriters. This finding potentially arises from a failure to account for self-selection in estimating offering cost relations. Using methods that account for self-selection, I find that underpricing and total offering costs are reduced for firms using warrants as underwriter compensation, consistent with the hypothesis that issuers choose compensation contracts which minimize costs.",['Craig G Dunbar'],"['Initial public offerings', 'Underpricing', 'Underwriter compensation', 'Self-selection', 'Warrants']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400805B,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,38,1
Evidence on the strategic allocation of initial public offerings,"The evidence reported in this paper suggests that institutional investors capture a large fraction of the short-run profits associated with IPOs. The favored status enjoyed by institutional investors in underpriced offerings appears, however, to carry a quid pro quo expectation that they will participate in less-attractive issues as well. This finding conforms with the Benveniste and Spindt (1989) and Benveniste and Wilhelm (1990) prediction that U.S. underwriters behave strategically in the allocation of IPOs.","['Kathleen Weiss Hanley', 'William J.

This is the first empirical examination of the relationship between computed firm-specific tax savings and firm value, and therefore provides evidence that helps resolve the theoretical dispute over ESOP tax savings.

Do corporations award CEO stock options effectively?,"This paper analyzes stock option awards to CEOs of 792 U.S. public corporations between 1984 and 1991. Using a Black-Scholes approach, I test whether stock options' performance incentives have significant associations with explanatory variables related to agency cost reduction. Further tests examine whether the mix of compensation between stock options and cash pay can be explained by corporate liquidity, tax status, or earnings management.

All in the family Nesting symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models,"This paper develops a parametric family of models of generalized autoregressive heteroskedasticity (GARCH). The family nests the most popular symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models, thereby highlighting the relation between the models and their treatment of asymmetry. Furthermore, the structure permits nested tests of different types of asymmetry and functional forms. Daily U.S. stock return data reject all standard GARCH models in favor of a model in which, roughly speaking, the conditional standard deviation depends on the shifted absolute value of the shocks raised to the power three halves and past standard deviations.",['Ludger Hentschel'],"['GARCH', 'Asymmetry', 'Heteroskedasticity', 'Variance', 'Volatility']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400821H,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,39,1
Capital market imperfections and the incentive to lease,"This paper evaluates the influence of financial contracting costs on public corporations' incentives to lease fixed capital. We argue that firms facing high costs of external funds can economize on the cost of funding by leasing. We construct several measures of leasing propensity, plus some a priori indicators of the severity of financial constraints facing firms. We find that the share of total annual fixed capital costs attributable to either capital or operating leases is substantially higher at lower-rated, non-dividend-paying, cash-poor firms — those likely to face relatively high premiums for external funds.","['Steven A.

Coercive tender and exchange offers in distressed high-yield debt restructurings An empirical analysis,"This paper examines a recent sample of public workouts for distressed high-yield debt. The nature of holdouts and the effectiveness of coercive tactics in alleviating the holdout problem is analyzed. Tender offers are in relatively less financial distress, exhibit more severe holdouts, and are more coercive than exchange offers. Tender offers also have higher completion rates and fewer Chapter 11 filings. Security prices react positively to announcements of tender offers, negatively to exchange offers. Evidence suggests that coercion is not detrimental to bondholders, and may benefit security holders by increasing the likelihood of a less costly, out-of-court restructuring.","['Sris Chatterjee', 'Upinder S.

Executive pay and performance Evidence from the U.S. banking industry,"This paper examines CEO pay in the banking industry and the effect of deregulating the market for corporate control. Using panel data on 147 banks over the 1980s, we find higher levels of pay in competitive corporate control markets, i.e., those in which interstate banking is permitted. We also find a stronger pay-performance relation in deregulated interstate banking markets. Finally, CEO turnover increases substantially after deregulation. These results provide evidence of a managerial talent market — one which matches the level and structure of pay with the competitiveness of the banking environment.","['R.Glenn Hubbard', 'Darius Palia']","['Pay', 'Performance', 'Corporate control', 'Deregulation', 'Banks']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400816J,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,39,1
Does Section 16b deter insider trading by target managers?,"This paper examines empirically whether the short-swing rule (Section 16b of the Securities Exchange Act) deters managers from trading before mergers. Since a merger forces the sale of the target's outstanding equity, insider purchases within six months before the merger cannot escape this rule. We examine the 1941–1961 period when no other insider trading laws were enforced. Consistent with 16b's deterrent effect, managers' purchases drop significantly before the announcement. Before completion, the decrease occurs only in the 1941–1955 period. Surprisingly, pre-announcement sales do not decline, even though 16b cannot punish deferral of planned sales.","['Anup Agrawal', 'Jeffrey F.

Does the market react differently to domestic and foreign takeover announcements? Evidence from the U.S. chemical and retail industries,"This paper examines shareholder wealth gains from domestic and foreign takeover announcements in the U.S. chemical and retail industries. Contrary to results in several recent papers, these data indicate there is no significant difference in within industry mean takeover premia levels. There is evidence, though, that the sensitivity of takeover premia levels to standard transaction characteristics does differ across buyers: Foreign investors do pay more than domestic investors in hostile transactions, but pay less when there are rival bidders. The results indicate the market's reaction to buyer nationality is closely tied to the transaction's characteristics.",['Kathryn L.

Closed-end fund premia and returns implications for financial market equilibrium,"This paper examines the relation between closed-end fund premia and returns. Additional evidence is provided on Thompson's (1978) finding that fund premia are negatively correlated with future returns. Funds with 20% discounts have expected twelve-month returns that are 6% greater than nondiscounted funds. This correlation is attributed to premium mean-reversion, not to anticipated future portfolio performance.

CEO turnover and the firm's investment decisions,"This paper examines the relation between management turnover and divestitures of recently acquired divisions. The empirical results indicate that at the time of a management change, there is an increased probability of divesting an acquisition at a loss or one considered unprofitable by the press. The probability increases by about the same amount regardless of whether the change is an apparent age-65 retirement or a resignation. Overall, the results are consistent with a variety of agency-based theories of corporate investment and suggest that management changes are important events for corporations because they lead to reversals of poor prior decisions.",['Michael S.

Market efficiency around the clock some supporting evidence using foreign-based derivatives,"This paper examines whether information across international markets is rationally incorporated into stock prices. We find that Japanese Nikkei index-based futures traded in the U.S. provide complete information about contemporaneous overnight Japanese returns. Moreover, existing cross-dependence between the U.S. and Japanese stock index returns is subsumed by the information content of the derivative securities. Our findings cast doubt on trading models based on irrational traders who either overreact or only partially adjust to movements in foreign stock markets.","['Alastair Craig', 'Ajay Dravid', 'Matthew Richardson']","['Market efficiency', 'Derivatives', 'Information flow', 'Trading hours']",[],October–November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400822I,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,39,2
Investment analysis and price formation in securities markets,"This paper investigates the relation between the number of analysts following a security and the estimated adverse selection cost of transacting in the security, controlling for the effects of previously identified determinants of liquidity. Using intraday data for the year 1988, we find that greater analyst following tends to reduce adverse selection costs based on the Kyle (1985) notion of market depth. This result is consistent with the analysis of Admati and Pfleiderer (1988). Estimates of structural parameters of a version of the Admati and Pfleiderer model of endogenous information acquisition provide qualified support for the model.","['Michael J.

Poison or placebo? Evidence on the deterrence and wealth effects of modern antitakeover measures,"This paper provides large-sample evidence that poison pill rights issues, control share laws, and business combination laws have not systematically deterred takeovers and are unlikely to have caused the demise of the 1980s market for corporate control, even though 87% of all exchange-listed firms are now covered by one of these antitakeover measures. We show that poison pills and control share laws are reliably associated with higher takeover premiums for selling shareholders, both unconditionally and conditional on a successful takeover, and we provide updated event study evidence for the three-quarters of all poison pills not yet analyzed. Antitakeover measures increase the bargaining position of target firms, but they do not prevent many transactions.","['Robert Comment', 'G.William Schwert']","['Poison pill', 'Antitakeover law', 'Merger', 'Tender offer', 'Takeover premium']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400823J,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,39,1
Increased debt and industry product markets an empirical analysis,"This paper tests for changes in firms' production and pricing decisions in four industries in which firms have sharply increased their financial leverage. The analysis of product price and quantity data shows that industry product market decisions are associated with capital structure. In three industries, output is negatively associated with the average industry debt ratio. In the one industry which shows a positive association between output and debt ratios, rival firms have low financial leverage and entry barriers are relatively low.

The structure of the model is analogous to traditional models of the term structure of interest rates. I show how the model is flexible enough to determine equilibrium lease rates for leases of any term and practically any structure, including forward leases, leases with options to renew or cancel, lease insurance contracts, adjustable-rate leases, and leases with payments contingent on asset usage.",['Steven R Grenadier'],"['Leasing', 'Options']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400820Q,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,38,3
"Asset sales, firm performance, and the agency costs of managerial discretion","We argue that management sells assets when doing so provides the cheapest funds to pursue its objectives rather than for operating efficiency reasons alone. This hypothesis suggests that (1) firms selling assets have high leverage and/or poor performance, (2) a successful asset sale is good news, and (3) the stock market discounts asset sale proceeds retained by the selling firm. In support of this hypothesis, we find that the typical firm in our sample performs poorly before the sale and that the average stock-price reaction to asset sales is positive only when the proceeds are paid out.","['Larry Lang', 'Annette Poulsen', 'René Stulz']",['Asset sales'],[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9400791X,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,37,1
Problems in measuring portfolio performance An application to contrarian investment strategies,"We document problems in measuring raw and abnormal five-year contrarian portfolio returns. ‘Loser’ stocks are low-priced and exhibit skewed return distributions. Their 163% mean return is due largely to their lowest-price quartile position. A $18-th price increase reduces the mean by 25%, highlighting their sensitivity to micro-structure/liquidity effects. Long positions in low-priced loser stocks occur disproportionately after bear markets and thus induce expected-return effects. A contrarian portfolio formed at June-end earns negative abnormal returns, in contrast with the December-end portfolio. This conclusion is not limited to a particular version of the CAPM.","['Ray Ball', 'S.P.

Underperformance in long-run stock returns following seasoned equity offerings,"We document that firms making seasoned equity offerings during 1975–1989 substantially underperformed a sample of matched firms from the same industry and of similar size that did not issue equity. This underperformance persists even after controlling for trading system, offer size, and the issuing firm's age and book-to-market ratio.

Equity ownership and the two faces of debt,"We empirically investigate the relation between corporate value, leverage, and equity ownership. For ‘high-growth’ firms corporate value is negatively correlated with leverage, whereas for ‘low-growth’ firms corporate value is positively correlated with leverage. The results also hint that the allocation of equity ownership among insiders, institutions, blockholders, and atomistic outside shareholders is of marginally greater significance in low-growth than in high-growth firms. The overall interpretation of the results is that debt policy and equity ownership structure ‘matter’ and that the way in which they matter differs between firms with many and firms with few positive net present value projects.","['John J.

Diversification's effect on firm value,We estimate diversification's effect on firm value by imputing stand-alone values for individual business segments. Comparing the sum of these stand-alone values to the firm's actual value implies a 13% to 15% average value loss from diversification during 1986–1991. The value loss is smaller when the segments of the diversified firm are in the same two-digit SIC code. We find that overinvestment and cross-subsidization contribute to the value loss.

To resolve this problem, CUC adopted an accounting change and then underwent a leveraged recapitalization. Subsequently, it accelerated recap debt repayments and initiated a stock repurchase.

Market underreaction to open market share repurchases,"We examine long-run firm performance following open market share repurchase announcements, 1980–1990. We find that the average abnormal four-year buy-and-hold return measured after the initial announcement is 12.1%. For ‘value’ stocks, companies more likely to be repurchasing shares because of undervaluation, the average abnormal return is 45.3%. For repurchases announced by ‘glamour’ stocks, where undervaluation is less likely to be an important motive, no positive drift in abnormal returns is observed. Thus, at least with respect to value stocks, the market errs in its initial response and appears to ignore much of the information conveyed through repurchase announcements.","['David Ikenberry', 'Josef Lakonishok', 'Theo Vermaelen']",['Stock repurchase'],[],October–November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X9500826Z,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,39,2
"Firm performance, corporate governance, and top executive turnover in Japan","We examine the role of corporate governance mechanisms during top executive turnover in Japanese corporations. Consistent with evidence from U.S. data, the likelihood of nonroutine turnover is significantly related to industry-adjusted return on assets, excess stock returns, and negative operating income, but is not related to industry performance. The sensitivity of nonroutine turnover to earnings performance is higher for firms with ties to a main bank than for firms without such ties. Outside succession in Japan is more likely for firms with large shareholders and a main bank relationship.

Evaluating the performance of value versus glamour stocks The impact of selection bias,"We examine whether sample selection bias explains the difference in returns between ‘value’ stocks (high book-to-market ratios) and ‘glamour’ stocks (low book-to-market ratios). Selection bias on Compustat is not a severe problem: for CRSP primary domestic firms, the proportion missing from Compustat is not large and the average return is not very different from the Compustat sample. Mechanical problems with matching Cusip identifiers account for much of the discrepancy between CRSP and Compustat.

Asset sales and increase in focus,"We find that asset sales lead to an improvement in the operating performance of the seller's remaining assets in each of the three years following the asset sale. The improvement in performance occurs primarily in firms that increase their focus; this change in operating performance is positively related to the seller's stock return at the divestiture announcement. The announcement stock returns are also greater for focus-increasing divestitures. Further, we find evidence that some of the seller's gains result from a better fit between the divested asset and the buyer.","['Kose John', 'Eli Ofek']","['Asset sales', 'Divestitures', 'Focus', 'Operating performance']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X94007942,Journal of Financial Economics,1995,37,1
Liquidation costs and capital structure,"We investigate the relation between liquidation costs of assets and composition of capital structure for firms that reorganized under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Firms with high liquidation costs emerge from Chapter 11 with relatively low debt ratios. The debt of these firms is more likely to be public and unsecured, and to have less restrictive covenant terms; these firms are also more likely to raise new equity capital. Assets with high liquidation costs thus lead firms to choose capital structures that make financial distress less likely.","['Michael J. Alderson', 'Brian L.

Causes of financial distress following leveraged recapitalizations,"We report that 31% of the firms completing leveraged recapitalizations between 1985 and 1988 subsequently encounter financial distress. Following their recaps, the distressed firms exhibit (1) poor operating performance due largely to industry-wide problems, (2) surprisingly low proceeds from asset sales, and (3) negative stock price reactions to economic and regulatory events associated with the demise of the market for highly-leveraged transactions. The incidence of distress is not related to several characteristics that have previously been linked with poorly-structured deals. We thus attribute the high rate of distress primarily to unexpected macroeconomic and regulatory developments.","['David J. Denis', 'Diane K.

Firm failure and managerial labor markets evidence from Texas banking,"We study the managerial labor market's ability to discriminate between good and bad managerial performance. Using a sample of failed and nonfailed Texas banks, we find that the context of job loss affects the manager's ability to regain comparable employment. Managers associated with banks that failed for reasons arguably beyond the managers' control were twice as likely to regain comparable banking posts as managers at other failed banks. We also detect a relation between the probability of post-failure reemployment and a manager's rank within the firm and to proxies for managerial self-dealing and competence.","['Albert A.
