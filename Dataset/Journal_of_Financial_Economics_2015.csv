A five-factor asset pricing model,"A five-factor model directed at capturing the size, value, profitability, and investment patterns in average stock returns performs better than the three-factor model of Fama and French (FF, 1993). The five-factor model׳s main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability. The model׳s performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.","['Eugene F.

Information reliability and welfare: A theory of coarse credit ratings,"An enduring puzzle is why credit rating agencies (CRAs) use a few categories to describe credit qualities lying in a continuum, even when ratings coarseness reduces welfare. We model a cheap-talk game in which a CRA assigns positive weights to the divergent goals of issuing firms and investors. The CRA wishes to inflate ratings but prefers an unbiased rating to one whose inflation exceeds a threshold. Ratings coarseness arises in equilibrium to preclude excessive rating inflation. We show that competition among CRAs can increase ratings coarseness. We also examine the welfare implications of regulatory initiatives.","['Anand M. Goel', 'Anjan V.

Search-based peer firms: Aggregating investor perceptions through internet co-searches,"Applying a “co-search” algorithm to Internet traffic at the SEC׳s EDGAR website, we develop a novel method for identifying economically related peer firms and for measuring their relative importance. Our results show that firms appearing in chronologically adjacent searches by the same individual (Search-Based Peers or SBPs) are fundamentally similar on multiple dimensions. In direct tests, SBPs dominate GICS6 industry peers in explaining cross-sectional variations in base firms׳ out-of-sample: (a) stock returns, (b) valuation multiples, (c) growth rates, (d) R&D expenditures, (e) leverage, and (f) profitability ratios. We show that SBPs are not constrained by standard industry classification, and are more dynamic, pliable, and concentrated. We also show that co-search intensity captures the degree of similarity between firms. Our results highlight the potential of the collective wisdom of investors — extracted from co-search patterns — in addressing long-standing benchmarking problems in finance.","['Charles M.C.

Do analysts matter for governance? Evidence from natural experiments,"Building on two sources of exogenous shocks to analyst coverage (broker closures and mergers), we explore the causal effects of analyst coverage on mitigating managerial expropriation of outside shareholders. We find that as a firm experiences an exogenous decrease in analyst coverage, shareholders value internal cash holdings less, its CEO receives higher excess compensation, its management is more likely to make value-destroying acquisitions, and its managers are more likely to engage in earnings management activities. Importantly, we find that most of these effects are mainly driven by the firms with smaller initial analyst coverage and less product market competition. We further find that after exogenous brokerage exits, a CEO׳s total and excess compensation become less sensitive to firm performance in firms with low initial analyst coverage. These findings are consistent with the monitoring hypothesis, specifically that financial analysts play an important governance role in scrutinizing management behavior, and the market is pricing an increase in expected agency problems after the loss in analyst coverage.","['Tao Chen', 'Jarrad Harford', 'Chen Lin']","['Financial analysts', 'Monitoring', 'Cash holdings', 'CEO compensation', 'Acquisitions']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002116,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,2
Monetary policy and long-term real rates,"Changes in monetary policy have surprisingly strong effects on forward real rates in the distant future. A 100 basis point increase in the two-year nominal yield on a Federal Open Markets Committee announcement day is associated with a 42 basis point increase in the ten-year forward real rate. This finding is at odds with standard macro-models based on sticky nominal prices, which imply that monetary policy cannot move real rates over a horizon longer than that over which all prices in the economy can readjust. Instead, the responsiveness of long-term real rates to monetary shocks appears to reflect changes in term premia. One mechanism that could generate such variation in term premia is based on demand effects due to the existence of what we call yield-oriented investors. We find some evidence supportive of this channel.","['Samuel G. Hanson', 'Jeremy C.

"A comment on Christoffersen, Jacobs, and Ornthanalai (2012), “Dynamic jump intensities and risk premiums: Evidence from S&P 500 returns and options”","Christoffersen, Jacobs, and Ornthanalai (2012) (CJO) propose an interesting and useful class of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH)-like models with dynamic jump intensity, and find evidence that the models not only fit returns data better than some commonly used benchmarks but also provide substantial improvements in option pricing performance. While such models pose difficulties for estimation and analysis, CJO propose an innovative approach to filtering intended to addresses them. However, some statistical issues arise that their approach leaves unresolved, with implications for the option pricing results. This note proposes a solution based on using the filter and estimator proposed by CJO but interpreted in the context of an alternative model. With respect to this model, the estimator is consistent, and likelihood-based model comparisons and hypothesis tests are valid.","['Garland Durham', 'John Geweke', 'Pulak Ghosh']","['Compound Poisson jumps', 'Risk premiums', 'Analytical filtering', 'Dynamic jump intensity']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001780,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,1
Momentum has its moments,"Compared with the market, value, or size factors, momentum has offered investors the highest Sharpe ratio. However, momentum has also had the worst crashes, making the strategy unappealing to investors who dislike negative skewness and kurtosis. We find that the risk of momentum is highly variable over time and predictable. Managing this risk virtually eliminates crashes and nearly doubles the Sharpe ratio of the momentum strategy. Risk-managed momentum is a much greater puzzle than the original version.","['Pedro Barroso', 'Pedro Santa-Clara']","['Anomalies', 'Momentum', 'Time-varying risk', 'Transaction costs of momentum']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002566,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,1
Culture and R2,"Consistent with predictions from the psychology literature, we find that stock prices co-move more (less) in culturally tight (loose) and collectivistic (individualistic) countries. Culture influences stock price synchronicity by affecting correlations in investors׳ trading activities and a country׳s information environment. Both market-wide and firm-specific variations are lower in tighter cultures. Individualism is mostly associated with higher firm-specific variations. Trade and financial openness weakens the effect of domestic culture on stock price comovements. These results hold for various robustness checks. Our study suggests that culture is an important omitted variable in the literature that investigates cross-country differences in stock price comovements.","['Cheol S.

Good and bad uncertainty: Macroeconomic and financial market implications,"Does macroeconomic uncertainty increase or decrease aggregate growth and asset prices? To address this question, we decompose aggregate uncertainty into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ volatility components, associated with positive and negative innovations to macroeconomic growth. We document that in line with our theoretical framework, these two uncertainties have opposite impact on aggregate growth and asset prices. Good uncertainty predicts an increase in future economic activity, such as consumption, output, and investment, and is positively related to valuation ratios, while bad uncertainty forecasts a decline in economic growth and depresses asset prices. Further, the market price of risk and equity beta of good uncertainty are positive, while negative for bad uncertainty. Hence, both uncertainty risks contribute positively to risk premia, and help explain the cross-section of expected returns beyond cash flow risk.","['Gill Segal', 'Ivan Shaliastovich', 'Amir Yaron']","['Uncertainty', 'Economic growth', 'Asset prices', 'Recursive utility']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000756,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,2
Costs and benefits of friendly boards during mergers and acquisitions,"Finance theory predicts that board independence is not always in the shareholders׳ interest. in situations in which board advice is more important than monitoring, independence can decrease firm value. I test this prediction by examining the connection between takeover returns and board friendliness, using social ties between the CEO and board members as a proxy for less independent boards. I find that social ties are associated with higher bidder announcement returns when the potential value of board advice is high, but with lower returns when monitoring needs are high. The evidence suggests that friendly boards can have both costs and benefits, depending on the company׳s specific needs.",['Breno Schmidt'],"['Board independence', 'Social ties', 'Mergers and acquisitions']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000239,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,2
Maturity rationing and collective short-termism,"Financing terms and investment decisions are jointly determined. This interdependence, which links firms׳ asset and liability sides, can lead to short-termism in investment. In our model, financing frictions increase with the investment horizon, such that financing for long-term projects is relatively expensive and potentially rationed. In response, firms whose first-best investments are long-term may adopt second-best projects of shorter maturities. This worsens financing terms for firms with shorter-maturity projects, inducing them to change their investments as well. In equilibrium, investment is inefficiently short-term. Equilibrium asset-side adjustments by firms can amplify shocks and, while privately optimal, can be socially undesirable.","['Konstantin Milbradt', 'Martin Oehmke']","['Short-termism', 'Asset maturity', 'Credit rationing', 'Asymmetric information', 'Cross-firm externality']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001846,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,3
Extraordinary acquirers,"Firm fixed effects alone explain as much of the variation in acquirer returns as all the firm- and deal-specific characteristics combined. An interquartile range of acquirer fixed effects is over 6%, comparable to the interquartile range of acquirer returns. Acquirer returns persist over time, but mainly at the top end of the distribution. Persistence continues under different chief executive officers (CEOs), and attributes of the broader management team do not explain the fixed effect. Firm-specific heterogeneity in acquirer returns suggests that some organizations are extraordinary acquirers irrespective of the leadership at the top and the deal structures they choose. Implications for the M&A research are discussed.","['Andrey Golubov', 'Alfred Yawson', 'Huizhong Zhang']","['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Acquirer returns', 'Performance persistence', 'Fixed effects']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000215,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,2
Foreign corporations and the culture of transparency: Evidence from Russian administrative data,Firms from developed countries carry a culture of transparency in business transactions that is opposite to the culture of hiding and insider dealing in developing and transition economies. We employ Russian administrative data on reported earnings and market values of cars to measure wage misreporting for individual employees of domestic firms in Moscow. We show that closer ties to multinationals lead to improved transparency of wage reporting in private Russian companies. Employees located closest to movers from multinationals in the job quality space experience the largest gains in transparency. We find a robust correlation between wage misreporting and accounting fraud.,"['Serguey Braguinsky', 'Sergey Mityakov']","['Culture', 'Transparency', 'Foreign corporations', 'Diffusion', 'Foreign direct investment']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13000597,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,1
Price support by bank-affiliated mutual funds,"Fund managers are double agents; they serve both fund investors and owners of management firms. This conflict of interest may result in trading to support securities prices. Tests of this hypothesis in the Spanish mutual fund industry indicate that bank-affiliated mutual funds systematically increase their holdings in the controlling bank stock around seasoned equity issues, at the time of bad news about the controlling bank, before anticipated price drops, and after non-anticipated price drops. The results seem mainly driven by bank managers׳ incentives. Ownership of asset management companies thus matters and can distort capital allocation and asset prices.","['Benjamin Golez', 'Jose M.

Deflating profitability,"Gross profit scaled by book value of total assets predicts the cross section of average returns. Novy-Marx (2013) concludes that it outperforms other measures of profitability such as bottom line net income, cash flows, and dividends. One potential explanation for the measure׳s predictive ability is that its numerator (gross profit) is a cleaner measure of economic profitability. An alternative explanation lies in the measure׳s deflator. We find that net income equals gross profit in predictive power when they have consistent deflators. Deflating profit by the book value of total assets results in a variable that is the product of profitability and the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of total assets, which is priced. We then construct an alternative measure of profitability, operating profitability, which better matches current expenses with current revenue. This measure exhibits a far stronger link with expected returns than either net income or gross profit. It predicts returns as far as ten years ahead, seemingly inconsistent with irrational pricing explanations.","['Ray Ball', 'Joseph Gerakos', 'Juhani T. Linnainmaa', 'Valeri V.

Equilibrium fast trading,"High speed market connections improve investors׳ ability to search for attractive quotes in fragmented markets, raising gains from trade. They also enable fast traders to obtain information before slow traders, generating adverse selection, and thus negative externalities. When investing in fast trading technologies, institutions do not internalize these externalities. Accordingly, they overinvest in equilibrium. Completely banning fast trading is dominated by offering two types of markets: one accepting fast traders, the other banning them. Utilitarian welfare is maximized with (i) a single market type on which fast and slow traders coexist and (ii) Pigovian taxes on investment in the fast trading technology.","['Bruno Biais', 'Thierry Foucault', 'Sophie Moinas']","['High-frequency trading', 'Externalities', 'Welfare']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000288,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,2
Deposits and bank capital structure,"In a model with bankruptcy costs and segmented deposit and equity markets, we endogenize the cost of equity and deposit finance for banks. Despite risk neutrality, equity capital earns a higher expected return than direct investment in risky assets. Banks hold positive capital to reduce bankruptcy costs, but there is a role for capital regulation when deposits are insured. Banks could no longer use capital when they lend to firms instead of investing directly in risky assets. This depends on whether the firms are public and compete with banks for equity capital or are private with exogenous amounts of capital.","['Franklin Allen', 'Elena Carletti', 'Robert Marquez']","['Deposit finance', 'Bankruptcy costs', 'Regulation']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002499,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,3
Volatility and mutual fund manager skill,"In a standard four-factor framework, mutual fund return volatility is a reliable, persistent, and powerful predictor of future abnormal returns. However, the abnormal returns are eliminated by the addition of a “vol” anomaly factor contrasting returns on portfolios of low and high volatility stocks. Consistent with Novy-Marx (2014) and Fama and French (2014), the Fama and French (2015) profitability and investment factors are equally effective at eliminating the abnormal returns. Failure to account for the vol anomaly, either directly or indirectly, can lead to substantial mismeasurement of fund manager skill.","['Bradford D. Jordan', 'Timothy B.

The JOBS Act and IPO volume: Evidence that disclosure costs affect the IPO decision,"In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) was enacted to help revitalize the initial public offering (IPO) market, especially for small firms. During the year ending March 2014, IPO volume and the proportion of small firm issuers was the largest since 2000. Controlling for market conditions, we estimate that the JOBS Act has led to 21 additional IPOs annually, a 25% increase over pre-JOBS levels. Firms with high proprietary disclosure costs, such as biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms, increase IPO activity the most. These firms are also more likely to take advantage of the act׳s de-risking provisions, allowing firms to file the IPO confidentially while testing-the-waters.","['Michael Dambra', 'Laura Casares Field', 'Matthew T.

Asymmetric decrease in liquidity trading before earnings announcements and the announcement return premium,"Investors are reluctant to trade in the high-information-asymmetry days before earnings announcements. We show that the decrease in liquidity trading before announcements is asymmetric. We analyze buy and sell orders of investors with passive investment strategies, and find they do not reduce their sales as much as their purchases in the days before announcements. Investors needing liquidity sell stocks at a discount relative to the post-announcement price, and these preannouncement liquidity sales are a significant driver of the average positive returns, or return premium, known to characterize announcement days.","['Shai Levi', 'Xiao-Jun Zhang']","['Earnings announcement premium', 'Liquidity']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001427,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,2
"Liquid-claim production, risk management, and bank capital structure: Why high leverage is optimal for banks","Liquidity production is a central function of banks. High leverage is optimal for banks in a model that has just enough frictions for banks to have a meaningful role in liquid-claim production. The model has a market premium for (socially valuable) safe/liquid debt, but no taxes or other traditional motives to lever up. Because only safe debt commands a liquidity premium, banks with risky assets use risk management to maximize their capacity to include such debt in the capital structure. The model can explain why banks have higher leverage than most operating firms, why risk management is central to banks׳ operating policies, why bank leverage increased over the last 150 years or so, and why leverage limits for regulated banks impede their ability to compete with unregulated shadow banks.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'René M.

Can managers time the market? Evidence using repurchase price data,"Little is known about the price firms pay for stock repurchases. Using a data set of all U.S. repurchases from 2004 to 2011, we compare the actual average price paid monthly in a repurchase with the average market price for the same stock over various horizons. We find that firms repurchase stock at a significantly lower price than the average market price in all sample years. Less frequent repurchasers, firms that repurchase when insiders buy on their own account, and firms that experience low stock returns prior to the repurchase obtain significantly lower prices. After controlling for risk factors, repurchasing firms earn positive returns. Infrequent repurchasers earn a significantly higher return up to three years following the actual repurchase.","['Amy Dittmar', 'Laura Casares Field']","['Repurchases', 'Market timing']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001913,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,2

I discuss some of the gaps that arise when thinking about microstructure research issues in the high frequency world.

Commonality in news around the world,"Motivated by the pioneering study of Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000), this paper investigates whether and how news commonality varies according to a country׳s institutional environments. Using a unique global news data set across 41 countries for the 2000–2009 period, we document three notable findings. First, firm-level news comoves more in countries with weaker institutional environments than in those with stronger institutional environments. Second, news commonality is positively associated with both stock return comovement and stock liquidity commonality. Third, the effect of news commonality on stock return and liquidity comovement is higher in countries with stronger institutions than in those with weaker institutions. These results suggest that a country׳s institutional environments affect firm-specific information production and, more importantly, support the information-efficiency view that lower price synchronicity is caused by greater capitalization of firm-specific information.","['Tung Lam Dang', 'Fariborz Moshirian', 'Bohui Zhang']","['News commonality', 'Information production', 'Institutional environments', 'Stock return comovement', 'Stock liquidity commonality']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002530,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,1
Wealth transfers via equity transactions,"Previous research indicates that firms issue shares when their stock is overpriced and repurchase shares when their stock is underpriced. Such transactions transfer wealth from transacting stockholders to ongoing stockholders. We quantify the magnitude of these wealth transfers and analyze their implications. Strikingly, we find that for the average firm-year, these wealth transfers approximate 40% of net income. We also find that these wealth transfers can be predicted using a variety of firm characteristics and that future wealth transfers are an important determinant of current stock prices.","['Richard G.

The adverse effects of systematic leakage ahead of official sovereign debt rating announcements,"Rating agencies consult with local government officials several days prior to official announcements of sovereign debt rating changes, making information leakage likely. Using cross-country data from 1988 to 2012, we find evidence of information leakage. In particular, we find statistically and economically significant negative daily abnormal stock index returns prior to downgrade announcements. These effects are more pronounced in countries with lower institutional quality, and they persist during times with no downgrade rumors and no concurrent bad news in general. A mild post-announcement reversal consistent with overreaction to pre-event downgrade rumors highlights the adverse effects of such leakage and, thus, should be a policy concern for capital market regulators.","['Alexander Michaelides', 'Andreas Milidonis', 'George P.

Dark trading and price discovery,"Regulators globally are concerned that dark trading harms price discovery. We show that dark trades are less informed than lit trades. High levels of dark trading increase adverse selection risk on the lit exchange by increasing the concentration of informed traders. Using both high- and low-frequency measures of informational efficiency we find that low levels of non-block dark trading are benign or even beneficial for informational efficiency, but high levels are harmful.

Juicing the dividend yield: Mutual funds and the demand for dividends,"Some mutual funds purchase stocks before dividend payments to artificially increase their dividends, which we call “juicing.” Funds paid more than twice the dividends implied by their holdings in 7.4% of fund-years examined. Juicing is associated with larger inflows, and is more common among funds with unsophisticated investors. This behavior is consistent with an underlying investor demand for dividends, but is hard to explain by taxes or need for income, as funds can generate equivalent tax-free distributions by returning capital. Juicing is costly to investors through higher turnover and increased taxes of 0.57% to 1.52% of fund assets per year.","['Lawrence E. Harris', 'Samuel M. Hartzmark', 'David H.

"The failure of models that predict failure: Distance, incentives, and defaults","Statistical default models, widely used to assess default risk, fail to account for a change in the relations between different variables resulting from an underlying change in agent behavior. We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997–2006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk could, therefore, be undermined by the actions of market participants.","['Uday Rajan', 'Amit Seru', 'Vikrant Vig']","['Statistical model', 'Lucas critique', 'Mortgage default', 'Regulation']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002098,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,2
Social interaction at work,"Stock market investment decisions of individuals are positively correlated with those of coworkers. Sorting of unobservably similar individuals to the same workplaces is unlikely to explain this pattern, as evidenced by the investment behavior of individuals who move between plants. Purchases made under stronger coworker purchase activity are not associated with higher returns. Moreover, social interaction appears to drive the purchase of within-industry stocks. Overall, we find a strong influence of coworkers on investment choices, but not an influence that improves the quality of investment decisions.","['Hans K.

Motivated monitors: The importance of institutional investors׳ portfolio weights,"Studies of institutional monitoring focus on the fraction of the firm held by institutions. We focus on the fraction of the institution׳s portfolio represented by the firm. In the context of acquisitions, we hypothesize that institutional monitoring will be greatest when the target firm represents a significant allocation of funds in the institution׳s portfolio. We show that this measure is important in reconciling mixed findings for total institutional ownership in the prior literature. The results indicate that our measure of institutional holdings leads to greater bid completion rates, higher premiums, and lower acquirer returns. This empirical evidence provides support for theories predicting a beneficial effect of blockholders in monitoring the firm in general and in enhancing the gains to takeover targets in particular.","['Eliezer M.

How do acquirers choose between mergers and tender offers?,"Tender offers provide the advantage of substantially faster completion times than mergers. However, a tender offer signals to the target higher demand for its shares and raises its reservation price. In equilibrium, bidders tradeoff speed and cost. Consistent with this theory, we show that deals in more competitive environments and deals with fewer external impediments on execution are more likely to be structured as tender offers. Tender offers also require higher premiums than mergers. Finally, the rivals of the bidding firm realize significantly lower announcement returns and subsequent operating performance in tender offers than in mergers.","['David Offenberg', 'Christo Pirinsky']","['Tender offers', 'Takeover premiums', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Termination fees', 'Arbitrage spreads']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000227,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,2
Fund managers under pressure: Rationale and determinants of secondary buyouts,"The fastest growing segment of private equity (PE) deals is secondary buyouts (SBOs)—sales from one PE fund to another. Using a comprehensive sample of leveraged buyouts, we investigate whether SBOs are value-maximizing, or reflect opportunistic behavior. To proxy for adverse incentives, we develop buy and sell pressure indexes based on how close PE funds are to the end of their investment period or lifetime, their unused capital, reputation, deal activity, and fundraising frequency. We report that funds under pressure engage more in SBOs. Pressured buyers pay higher multiples, use less leverage, and syndicate less suggesting that their motive is to spend equity. Pressured sellers exit at lower multiples and have shorter holding periods. When pressured counterparties meet, deal multiples depend on differential bargaining power. Moreover, funds that invested under pressure underperform.","['Sridhar Arcot', 'Zsuzsanna Fluck', 'José-Miguel Gaspar', 'Ulrich Hege']","['Leveraged buyouts', 'Secondary buyouts', 'Private equity', 'Limited investment horizon', 'Agency conflicts in fund management']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001640,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,1
"Financial integration, housing, and economic volatility","The Great Recession illustrates the sensitivity of the economy to housing. This paper shows that financial integration, fostered by securitization and nationwide branching, amplified the positive effect of housing price shocks on the economy during the 1994–2006 period. We exploit variation in credit supply subsidies across local markets from government-sponsored enterprises to measure housing price changes unrelated to fundamentals. Using this instrument, we find that house price shocks spur economic growth. The effect is larger in localities more financially integrated, through both secondary loan market and bank branch networks. Financial integration thus raised the effect of collateral shocks on local economies, increasing economic volatility.","['Elena Loutskina', 'Philip E.

Tail risk premia and return predictability,"The variance risk premium, defined as the difference between the actual and risk-neutral expectations of the forward aggregate market variation, helps predict future market returns. Relying on a new essentially model-free estimation procedure, we show that much of this predictability may be attributed to time variation in the part of the variance risk premium associated with the special compensation demanded by investors for bearing jump tail risk, consistent with the idea that market fears play an important role in understanding the return predictability.","['Tim Bollerslev', 'Viktor Todorov', 'Lai Xu']",[],[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001269,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,1
Military CEOs,"There is mounting evidence of the influence of personal characteristics of chief executive officers (CEOs) on corporate outcomes. In this paper we analyze the relation between military service of CEOs and managerial decisions, financial policies, and corporate outcomes. Exploiting exogenous variation in the propensity to serve in the military, we show that military service is associated with conservative corporate policies and ethical behavior. Military CEOs pursue lower corporate investment, are less likely to be involved in corporate fraudulent activity, and perform better during industry downturns. Taken together, our results show that military service has significant explanatory power for managerial decisions and firm outcomes.","['Efraim Benmelech', 'Carola Frydman']","['CEOs', 'Fraud', 'Military', 'Ethics', 'Corporate Governance']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14000932,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,1
Financing bidders in takeover contests,"This paper argues that endogenizing how acquirers finance their cash bids is just as important for understanding bidding in takeovers as endogenizing acquirers׳ payment method choice. The paper shows that acquirers finance their cash bids with equity only if they lack access to competitive financing. This leads to underbidding and lower takeover premiums. Conversely, acquirers with access to competitive financing use debt and overbid. Endogenizing the payment method reveals that security (e.g., stock) bids carry lower premiums than cash bids, backed by competitive financing. These insights find empirical support and could help explain existing evidence, which contradicts prior theory.",['Vladimir Vladimirov'],"['Takeover premiums', 'Financing bidders', 'Takeover contests', 'Financial constraints', 'Security design']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000938,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,3
Are institutions informed about news?,This paper combines daily buy and sell institutional trading volume with all news announcements from Reuters. Using institutional order flow (buy volume minus sell volume) we find a variety of evidence that institutions are informed. Institutional trading volume predicts the occurrence of news announcements. Institutional order flow predicts (i) the sentiment of the news; (ii) the stock market reaction on news announcement days; (iii) the stock market reaction on crisis news days; and (iv) earnings announcement surprises.

Do property rights matter? Evidence from a property law enactment,"This paper considers a property law enactment that gave creditors more rights over the assets underlying their secured loans to private firms and gave private firms more protections against the potential expropriation of their assets. We find that this property law enactment led to a significant increase in firm value. We also find that the law׳s impact on value was more profound for firms with more tangible assets, lower internal cash flows, and stronger growth opportunities, and less profound for politically connected firms. Taken together, our findings confirm the importance of property rights protection in enhancing firm value.","['Daniel Berkowitz', 'Chen Lin', 'Yue Ma']","['Property rights', 'Creditor rights', 'Expropriation risk', 'Asset tangibility', 'Political connections']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1500046X,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,3
Does ambiguity matter? Estimating asset pricing models with a multiple-priors recursive utility,"This paper considers asset pricing models with stochastic differential utility incorporating decision makers׳ concern with ambiguity on true probability measure. Under a representative agent setting, we empirically evaluate alternative preference specifications including a multiple-priors recursive utility. We find that relative risk aversion is estimated around 1–8 with ambiguity aversion and 7.4–15 without ambiguity aversion. Estimated ambiguity aversion is both economically and statistically significant and can explain up to 45% of the average equity premium. The elasticity of intertemporal substitution is higher than one, but its identification appears to be weak, as observed by previous authors.","['Daehee Jeong', 'Hwagyun Kim', 'Joon Y.

Friends or foes? The interrelationship between angel and venture capital markets,"This paper develops a theory of how angel and venture capital markets interact. Entrepreneurs first receive angel then venture capital funding. The two investor types are ‘friends’ in that they rely upon each other׳s investments. However, they are also ‘foes,’ because at the later stage the venture capitalists no longer need the angels. Using a costly search model we derive the equilibrium deal flows across the two markets, endogenously deriving market sizes, competitive structures, valuation levels, and exit rates. We also examine the role of legal protection for angel investments.","['Thomas Hellmann', 'Veikko Thiele']","['Entrepreneurship', 'Angel investors', 'Venture capital', 'Start-ups', 'Search']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002311,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,3
Generalized risk premia,"This paper develops an optimal trading strategy explicitly linked to an agent׳s preferences and assessment of the distribution of asset returns. The price of this strategy is a portfolio of implied moments, and its expected excess returns naturally accommodate compensation for higher-order moment risk. Variance risk and the equity premium approximate it to first order and it nests cross-sectional asset pricing models such as the linear Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). An empirical study in the US index market compares the investment behavior of an agent with recursive long-run risk preferences to one who merely uses an identically independently distributed time series model and takes market prices as given.

Political capital and moral hazard,"This paper examines how political connections affect risk exposure of financial institutions. Using a geography-based measure, I find that politically connected firms have higher leverage and their stocks have higher volatility and beta. Furthermore, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, politically-connected financial firms had higher leverage and were more likely to increase their leverage during the housing bubble in response to local growth in median housing prices. During the crisis, higher leverage was associated with worse performance but being in a state with a US Senator on the Banking Committee was correlated with weakly improved stock returns and reduced bankruptcy probability, highlighting the value of political connections for financial firms.",['Leonard Kostovetsky'],"['Moral hazard', 'Financial crisis', 'Bank leverage', 'Political connections', 'Risk taking']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002736,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,1

I find that a 1 standard deviation increase in management PTC corresponds to a 3.6% increase in income diversion and that firms with corrupt management significantly outperform their counterparts.

Combined acquirer and target announcement returns are also lower in the presence of strong labor rights. Our findings remain statistically and economically significant after we control for a range of deal, firm, industry and state characteristics and explore various channels for the labor rights effect.

Bank loans and troubled debt restructurings,"This paper examines the relation between the number and type of lenders that participate in corporate loan facilities and the nature of troubled debt restructurings. We find that loans from traditional bank lenders are significantly easier to restructure out of court than loans from institutional lenders. We also find that the existence of a past banking relationship between the borrower and the lead arranger of a syndicated loan adversely affects the ease of restructuring. Finally, we find that reliance on loans that are held in part by collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) is positively related to the likelihood of a prepackaged bankruptcy, consistent with greater holdout problems when loans are held by CLOs. Overall, our findings suggest that the role of banks in the restructuring process is quite different when bank loans are diffusely held or securitized.","['Cem Demiroglu', 'Christopher James']","['Debt restructuring', 'Bankruptcy', 'Holdout problem', 'CLOs']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001245,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,1

Our results show that the locked-out cash due to repatriation tax costs is associated with a higher likelihood of foreign (but not domestic) acquisitions. We also find a negative association between tax-induced foreign cash holdings and the market reaction to foreign deals. This result suggests that the investment activity of firms with high repatriation tax costs is viewed by the market as less value-enhancing than that of firms with low tax costs, consistent with foreign investment of firms with high repatriation tax costs possibly reflecting agency-driven behavior.","['Michelle Hanlon', 'Rebecca Lester', 'Rodrigo Verdi']","['Cash', 'Investment', 'Tax']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002748,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,1

The production and price-setting decisions of firms drive low-frequency movements in growth and inflation rates that are negatively related. With recursive preferences, these growth and inflation dynamics are crucial for rationalizing key stylized facts in bond markets.

This effect is more pronounced among financially constrained firms and for firms that are likely to benefit more from diffused technology, e.g., those that have newer patents, are more profitable, and face better growth opportunities. The spillover impact remains strong when product market competition and own-firm innovations are accounted for.

Resource accumulation through economic ties: Evidence from venture capital,"Ties between similar partners in economic and financial networks are often attributed to concerns about agency costs. In this paper, we distinguish the underlying motives for tie formation between sets of potential partners in the network, thus informing the relative importance of agency cost and resource accumulation in tie formation across firms. We develop a robust and generalizable methodology that allows for the inference of similarity and/or cumulative advantage motives in the potential presence of resource trading. We estimate the model using venture capital (VC) co-investment networks, employing factor analysis to characterize orthogonal, interpretable resources for VC firms. In the VC setting, value-added resources other than capital appear to be exchanged for capital, but not for one another. We find little evidence for similarity motives as the primary driver of matching, suggesting that concerns over agency conflicts in partnering are dominated by the desire to accumulate higher levels of certain resources.","['Yael V.

A century of capital structure: The leveraging of corporate America,"Unregulated US corporations dramatically increased their debt usage over the past century. Aggregate leverage—low and stable before 1945—more than tripled between 1945 and 1970 from 11% to 35%, eventually reaching 47% by the early 1990s. The median firm in 1946 had no debt, but by 1970 had a leverage ratio of 31%. This increase occurred in all unregulated industries and affected firms of all sizes. Changing firm characteristics are unable to account for this increase. Rather, changes in government borrowing, macroeconomic uncertainty, and financial sector development play a more prominent role. Despite this increase among unregulated firms, a combination of stable debt usage among regulated firms and a decrease in the fraction of aggregate assets held by regulated firms over this period resulted in a relatively stable economy-wide leverage ratio during the 20th century.","['John R.

The role of dynamic renegotiation and asymmetric information in financial contracting,"Using data from Securities and Exchange Commission filings, I show that the typical bank loan is renegotiated five times, or every nine months. The pricing, maturity, amount, and covenants are all significantly modified during each renegotiation, whose timing is governed by the financial health of the contracting parties and uncertainty regarding the borrowers’ credit quality. The relative importance of these factors depends on the duration of the lending relationship.

In line with the predictions of an illustrative model, young maturing wines from high-quality vintages provide the highest financial returns. Past maturity, famous châteaus deliver growing non-pecuniary benefits to their owners. Using an arithmetic repeat-sales regression over 1900–2012, we estimate a real financial return to wine investment (net of storage costs) of 4.1%, which exceeds bonds, art, and stamps.

As certain as debt and taxes: Estimating the tax sensitivity of leverage from state tax changes,"Using staggered corporate income tax changes across U.S. states, we show that taxes have a first-order effect on capital structure. Firms increase leverage by around 40 basis points for every percentage-point tax increase. Consistent with dynamic tradeoff theory, the effect is asymmetric: leverage does not respond to tax cuts. This is true even within-firm: tax increases that are later reversed nonetheless lead to permanent leverage increases. The treatment effects are heterogeneous and confirm the tax channel: tax sensitivity is greater among profitable and investment-grade firms which respectively have a greater marginal tax benefit and lower marginal cost of issuing debt.","['Florian Heider', 'Alexander Ljungqvist']","['Capital structure', 'Taxes', 'Tradeoff theory', 'Dynamic capital structure models', 'Natural experiments']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000057,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,3
Measuring skill in the mutual fund industry,"Using the value that a mutual fund extracts from capital markets as the measure of skill, we find that the average mutual fund has used this skill to generate about $3.2 million per year. Large cross-sectional differences in skill persist for as long as ten years. Investors recognize this skill and reward it by investing more capital with better funds. Better funds earn higher aggregate fees, and a strong positive correlation exists between current compensation and future performance.

"Debt, labor markets, and the creation and destruction of firms","We analyze the financing and liquidation decisions of firms that face a labor market with search frictions. By inducing bankruptcy, debt can facilitate the process of creative destruction (i.e., the elimination of inefficient firms and the creation of new firms) but can also lead to excessive liquidation and unemployment in particular, during economic downturns. Within this setting, we examine policy interventions that influence the firms׳ financing and liquidation choices. We consider the role of monetary policy, which can reduce debt burdens during economy-wide downturns, and tax policy, which can influence the incentives of firms to use debt financing.","['Andres Almazan', 'Adolfo de Motta', 'Sheridan Titman']","['Capital structure', 'Debt', 'Labor markets', 'Unemployment', 'Corporate taxes']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001154,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,3
Impact of the Dodd-Frank act on credit ratings,"We analyze the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) on corporate bond ratings issued by credit rating agencies (CRAs). We find no evidence that Dodd-Frank disciplines CRAs to provide more accurate and informative credit ratings. Instead, following Dodd-Frank, CRAs issue lower ratings, give more false warnings, and issue downgrades that are less informative. These results are consistent with the reputation model of Morris (2001), and suggest that CRAs become more protective of their reputation following the passage of Dodd-Frank. Consistent with Morris (2001), we find that our results are stronger for industries with low Fitch market share, where Moody׳s and Standard & Poor׳s have stronger incentives to protect their reputation (Becker and Milbourn, 2011). Our results are not driven by business cycle effects or firm characteristics, and strengthen as the uncertainty regarding the passage of Dodd-Frank gets resolved. We conclude that increasing the legal and regulatory costs to CRAs might have an adverse effect on the quality of credit ratings.","['Valentin Dimitrov', 'Darius Palia', 'Leo Tang']","['Dodd-Frank', 'Reputation', 'Credit ratings', 'Information', 'Financial crisis']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002347,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,3
Payout policy through the financial crisis: The growth of repurchases and the resilience of dividends,"We compare the payout policies of US industrials and banks over the past 30 years to better understand dividends, especially for banks. For industrials, dividends grow strongly after 2002, when the declining propensity to pay reverses. Banks have a higher and more stable propensity to pay dividends and resist cutting dividends as the 2007–2008 financial crisis begins. Before the crisis, increases in repurchases push payouts to historic levels. These findings are broadly consistent with the idea that banks use dividends to signal financial strength while agency costs of free cash flow better explain industrial payouts.","['Eric Floyd', 'Nan Li', 'Douglas J.

Liquidity hoarding and interbank market rates: The role of counterparty risk,"We develop a model of interbank lending and borrowing with counterparty risk. The model has two key ingredients. First, liquidity in the banking sector is endogenous, so there is an opportunity cost of holding liquid assets. Second, banks are privately informed about the risk of their long-term assets, which can lead to adverse selection and high interest rates in the interbank market. We identify a novel form of a market break-down, which can lead to liquidity hoarding. It arises because adverse selection in the interbank market changes the opportunity cost of holding liquidity. We use the model to shed light on developments in interbank markets prior to and during the 2007–09 financial crisis, as well as the effectiveness of policy interventions aimed at restoring interbank market activity.","['Florian Heider', 'Marie Hoerova', 'Cornelia Holthausen']","['Interbank market', 'Endogenous liquidity', 'Counterparty risk', 'Asymmetric information', 'Market break-down', 'Financial crisis']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001233,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,2
Signal or noise? Uncertainty and learning about whether other traders are informed,"We develop a model where some investors are uncertain whether others are trading on informative signals or noise. Uncertainty about others leads to a nonlinear price that reacts asymmetrically to news. We incorporate this uncertainty into a dynamic setting where traders gradually learn about others and show that it generates empirically relevant return dynamics: expected returns are stochastic but predictable, and volatility exhibits clustering and the “leverage” effect. The model nests both the rational expectations (RE) and differences of opinions (DO) approaches and highlights a link between disagreement about fundamentals and uncertainty about other traders.","['Snehal Banerjee', 'Brett Green']","['Rational expectations', 'Difference of opinions', 'Sentiment', 'Volatility clustering', 'Leverage effect']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000744,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,2
A theory of LBO activity based on repeated debt-equity conflicts,"We develop a theory of leveraged buyout (LBO) activity based on two elements: the ability of private equity-owned firms to borrow against their sponsors׳ reputation with creditors and externalities in sponsors׳ reputations due to competition and club formation. In equilibrium, the two sources of value creation in LBOs, operational improvements and financing, are complements. Moreover, sponsors that never add operational value cannot add value through financing either. Club deals are beneficial ex post by allowing low-reputation bidders with high valuations to borrow reputation from high-reputation bidders with low valuations, but they can destroy value by reducing bidders׳ investment in reputation. Unlike leverage of independent firms, driven only by firm-specific factors, buyout leverage is driven by economy-wide and sponsor-specific factors.","['Andrey Malenko', 'Nadya Malenko']","['Leveraged buyouts', 'Private equity', 'Reputation', 'Debt-equity conflicts', 'Club deals']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001002,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,3

Payout reductions are more likely in firms with higher leverage, more valuable growth options, and lower cash balances, i.e., those more susceptible to the negative consequences of an external financing shock. Moreover, firms appear to use the proceeds from the reduction in payout to maintain cash levels and to fund investment. These findings are consistent with the view that a shock to the supply of credit (net of demand effects) during the financial crisis increased the marginal benefit of cash retention, leading some firms to turn to payout reductions as a substitute form of financing.","['Barbara A.

Scale and skill in active management,"We empirically analyze the nature of returns to scale in active mutual fund management. We find strong evidence of decreasing returns at the industry level. As the size of the active mutual fund industry increases, a fund׳s ability to outperform passive benchmarks declines. At the fund level, all methods considered indicate decreasing returns, though estimates that avoid econometric biases are insignificant. We also find that the active management industry has become more skilled over time. This upward trend in skill coincides with industry growth, which precludes the skill improvement from boosting fund performance. Finally, we find that performance deteriorates over a typical fund׳s lifetime. This result can also be explained by industry-level decreasing returns to scale.","['Ľuboš Pástor', 'Robert F.

The disintermediation of financial markets: Direct investing in private equity,"We examine 20 years of direct private equity investments by seven large institutions. These direct investments perform better than public market indices, especially buyout investments and those made in the 1990s. Outperformance by the direct investments, however, relative to the corresponding private equity fund benchmarks is limited and concentrated among buyout transactions. Co-investments underperform the corresponding funds with which they co-invest, due to an apparent adverse selection of transactions available to these investors, while solo transactions outperform fund benchmarks. Investors’ ability to resolve information problems appears to be an important driver of solo deal outcomes.","['Lily Fang', 'Victoria Ivashina', 'Josh Lerner']","['Financial intermediation', 'Private equity', 'Direct investment', 'Co-investment']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002724,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,1
"Executives' “off-the-job” behavior, corporate culture, and financial reporting risk","We examine how executives' behavior outside the workplace, as measured by their ownership of luxury goods (low “frugality”) and prior legal infractions, is related to financial reporting risk. We predict and find that chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) with a legal record are more likely to perpetrate fraud. In contrast, we do not find a relation between executives' frugality and the propensity to perpetrate fraud. However, as predicted, we find that unfrugal CEOs oversee a relatively loose control environment characterized by relatively high and increasing probabilities of other insiders perpetrating fraud and unintentional material reporting errors during their tenure. Further, cultural changes associated with an increase in fraud risk are more likely during unfrugal (vs. frugal) CEOs' reigns, including the appointment of an unfrugal CFO, an increase in executives' equity-based incentives to misreport, and a decline in measures of board monitoring intensity.","['Robert Davidson', 'Aiyesha Dey', 'Abbie Smith']","['Executive frugality', 'Legal infractions', 'Financial reporting risk', 'Corporate culture']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13001992,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,1
Banks as patient fixed-income investors,"We examine the business model of traditional commercial banks when they compete with shadow banks. While both types of intermediaries create safe “money-like” claims, they go about this in different ways. Traditional banks create money-like claims by holding illiquid fixed-income assets to maturity, and they rely on deposit insurance and costly equity capital to support this strategy. This strategy allows bank depositors to remain “sleepy”: they do not have to pay attention to transient fluctuations in the market value of bank assets. In contrast, shadow banks create money-like claims by giving their investors an early exit option requiring the rapid liquidation of assets. Thus, traditional banks have a stable source of funding, while shadow banks are subject to runs and fire-sale losses. In equilibrium, traditional banks have a comparative advantage at holding fixed-income assets that have only modest fundamental risk but are illiquid and have substantial transitory price volatility, whereas shadow banks tend to hold relatively liquid assets.","['Samuel G.

The effect of institutional ownership on firm transparency and information production,"We examine the effects of institutional ownership on firms׳ information and trading environments using the annual Russell 1000/2000 index reconstitution. Characteristics of firms near the index cutoffs are similar, except that firms in the top of the Russell 2000 have discontinuously higher proportional institutional ownership than firms in the bottom of the Russell 1000 primarily due to indexing and benchmarking strategies. We find that higher institutional ownership is associated with greater management disclosure, analyst following, and liquidity, resulting in lower information asymmetry. Overall, indexing institutions׳ predilection for lower information asymmetries facilitates information production, which enhances monitoring and decreases trading costs.","['Audra L.

The illiquidity premium: International evidence,"We examine the illiquidity premium in stock markets across 45 countries and present two findings. First, the average illiquidity return premium across countries is positive and significant, after controlling for other pricing factors. The premium is measured by monthly return series on illiquid-minus-liquid stocks or by the coefficient of stock illiquidity estimated from cross section Fama-MacBeth regressions. Second, a commonality exists across countries in the illiquidity return premium, controlling for common global return factors and variation in global illiquidity. This commonality is different from commonality in illiquidity itself and is greater in globally integrated markets.","['Yakov Amihud', 'Allaudeen Hameed', 'Wenjin Kang', 'Huiping Zhang']","['Illiquidity premium', 'International markets', 'Commonality in illiquidity premium']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000483,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,2
Banks׳ liability structure and mortgage lending during the financial crisis,We examine the impact of banks׳ exposure to market liquidity shocks through wholesale funding on their supply of credit during the financial crisis using loan level data that best allow us to isolate supply-side effects. We find that banks that were more reliant on wholesale funding curtailed their credit significantly more than retail-funded banks. We also exploit the discrete fall in the liquidity of loans above the jumbo cutoff and show that this effect is significantly more pronounced for less liquid loans in line with a liquidity channel. We show that this result cannot be attributed to uneven shifts in demand. The negative relation between wholesale funding and the supply of credit is unique to the crisis episode.,"['Jihad Dagher', 'Kazim Kazimov']","['Wholesale funding', 'Credit supply', 'Liquidity risk', 'Financial crisis']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000069,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,3
"High-frequency quoting, trading, and the efficiency of prices","We examine the relation between high frequency quotation and the behavior of stock prices between 2009 and 2011 for the full cross section of securities in the US. On average, higher quotation activity is associated with price series that more closely resemble a random walk, and significantly lower cost of trading. We also explore market resiliency during periods of exceptionally high low-latency trading: large liquidity drawdowns in which, within the same millisecond, trading algorithms systematically sweep large volume across multiple trading venues. Although such large drawdowns incur trading costs, they do not appear to degrade the price formation process or increase the subsequent cost of trading. In an out-of-sample analysis, we investigate an exogenous technological change to the trading environment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange that dramatically reduces latency and allows co-location of servers. This shock also results in prices more closely resembling a random walk and a sharp decline in the cost of trading.","['Jennifer Conrad', 'Sunil Wahal', 'Jin Xiang']","['High frequency trading', 'Market microstructure', 'Market efficiency']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000240,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,2
"When firms talk, do investors listen? The role of trust in stock market reactions to corporate earnings announcements","We examine whether the level of trust in a country affects investors' perception and utilization of information transmitted by firms through financial disclosure. Specifically, we investigate the effect of societal trust on investor reactions to corporate earnings announcements. We test two competing hypotheses. On the one hand, corporate earnings announcements are perceived as more credible by investors in more trusting societies and, therefore, elicit stronger investor reactions. On the other hand, societal trust mitigates outside investors' concern of moral hazard and reduces the value of corporate earnings announcements to them, thereby weakening their reactions to these events. We analyze the abnormal trading volume and abnormal stock return variance during the earnings announcement period in a large sample of firm-year observations across 25 countries, and we find that both measures of investor reactions to earnings announcements are significantly higher in more trusting countries. We also find that the positive effect of societal trust on investor reactions to earnings news is more pronounced when a country's investor protection and disclosure requirements are weaker, suggesting that trust acts as a substitute for formal institutions; when a country's average education level is lower, consistent with less educated people relying more on trust in making economic decisions; and when firm-level information asymmetry is higher, supporting the notion that trust plays a more important role in poorer information environments.","['Mikhail Pevzner', 'Fei Xie', 'Xiangang Xin']","['Culture', 'Trust', 'Corporate earnings announcement', 'Investor reaction']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X13002055,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,1
Does banking competition affect innovation?,"We exploit the deregulation of interstate bank branching laws to test whether banking competition affects innovation. We find robust evidence that banking competition reduces state-level innovation by public corporations headquartered within deregulating states. Innovation increases among private firms that are dependent on external finance and that have limited access to credit from local banks. We argue that banking competition enables small, innovative firms to secure financing instead of being acquired by public corporations. Therefore, banking competition reduces the supply of innovative targets, which reduces the portion of state-level innovation attributable to public corporations. Overall, these results shed light on the real effects of banking competition and the determinants of innovation.","['Jess Cornaggia', 'Yifei Mao', 'Xuan Tian', 'Brian Wolfe']","['Banking competition', 'Innovation', 'Access to finance', 'Mergers and acquisitions']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001858,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,1
Investment and CEO compensation under limited commitment,"We extend the neoclassical investment model (Hayashi, 1982) to allow for limited commitment on compensation contracts. We consider three types of limited commitment: (i) managers cannot commit to compensation contracts that provide lower continuation utility than their outside options; (ii) shareholders cannot commit to negative net present value (NPV) projects; (iii) both the managers and the shareholders cannot commit. We characterize the optimal contract under general convex adjustment cost functions and provide examples for which closed-form solutions can be obtained. We show that, as in the data, small firms invest more, grow faster, and have a higher Tobin׳s Q than large firms under the optimal contract. In addition, the pattern of the dependence of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation on past performance implied by our model is also consistent with empirical evidence.","['Hengjie Ai', 'Rui Li']","['Dynamic contract', 'Limited commitment', 'Investment']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000458,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,3
Lost in translation? The effect of cultural values on mergers around the world,"We find strong evidence that three key dimensions of national culture (trust, hierarchy, and individualism) affect merger volume and synergy gains. The volume of cross-border mergers is lower when countries are more culturally distant. In addition, greater cultural distance in trust and individualism leads to lower combined announcement returns. These findings are robust to year and country-level fixed effects, time-varying country-pair and deal-level variables, as well as instrumental variables for cultural differences based on genetic and somatic differences. The results are the first large-scale evidence that cultural differences have substantial impacts on multiple aspects of cross-border mergers.","['Kenneth R.

Social learning and corporate peer effects,"We find that firms are more likely to split their stock if their peer firms have recently done so. The effect is comparable to an increase of 40–50% in the share price. Splitting probability is also increasing in the announcement returns of peer splits. These results are consistent with social learning from peers’ actions and outcomes. The unique features of the setting and various further tests render alternative explanations unlikely. We find no clear benefit in following successful peer splitters. Firms are sometimes suspected to succumb to imitation, and the effect we show could be a case in point.","['Markku Kaustia', 'Ville Rantala']","['Peer effect', 'Stock splits', 'Social learning']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000999,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,3
Value versus growth investing: Why do different investors have different styles?,"We find that several factors explain an individual investor׳s style, i.e., the value versus growth orientation of the investor׳s stock portfolio. First, we find that an investor׳s style has a biological basis and is partially ingrained in an investor from birth. Second, we show that an investor׳s hedging demands as well as behavioral biases explain investment style. Finally, an investor׳s style is explained by life course theory in that experiences, both earlier and later in life, are related to investment style. Investors with adverse macroeconomic experiences (e.g., growing up during the Great Depression or entering the labor market during an economic recession) or who grow up in a lower socioeconomic status rearing environment have a stronger value orientation several decades later. Our research contributes a new perspective to the long-standing value and growth debate in finance.","['Henrik Cronqvist', 'Stephan Siegel', 'Frank Yu']","['Investment behavior', 'Portfolio choice', 'Value investing', 'Growth investing']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000495,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,2

We analyze 4,495 bonds issued between 1980 and 2012. When interest rates are high, a majority of investment-grade issues and almost the entire subset with long maturities (>20 years) include a call premium. When interest rates are low, virtually all investment-grade issues with long and short maturities are callable at par. High-yield issues are limited to short maturities. By about 4:1, they include a call premium regardless of interest rate levels.","['Manish Tewari', 'Anthony Byrd', 'Pradipkumar Ramanlal']","['Corporate finance', 'Financing', 'Callable debt', 'Structured provisions', 'Agency conflict']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002086,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,2
"Trading rules, competition for order flow and market fragmentation","We investigate competition between traditional stock exchanges and new dark trading venues using an important difference in regulatory treatment. Securities and Exchange Commission required minimum pricing increments constrain some stock spreads, causing large limit order queues. Dark pools allow some traders to bypass existing limit order queues with minimal price improvement. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that spread constraints significantly weaken exchanges׳ competitiveness. As more orders migrate to dark pools, the probability of subsequent order execution there increases, raising liquidity. The ability to circumvent time priority of displayed limit orders is one cause of the rapid rise in US equity market fragmentation.","['Amy Kwan', 'Ronald Masulis', 'Thomas H.

Government ownership and the cost of debt: Evidence from government investments in publicly traded firms,"We investigate how government equity ownership in publicly traded firms affects the cost of corporate debt. Using a sample of bond credit spreads from 43 countries over 1991–2010, we find that government ownership is generally associated with a higher cost of debt, consistent with state-induced investment distortions, but is associated with a lower cost of debt during financial crises and for firms more likely to be distressed, when implicit government guarantees become the dominant effect. Our results are robust to controls for the endogeneity of government ownership, and we find these effects to be specific to domestic government ownership.","['Ginka Borisova', 'Veljko Fotak', 'Kateryna Holland', 'William L.

"Smart money, dumb money, and capital market anomalies","We investigate the dual notions that “dumb money” exacerbates well-known stock return anomalies and “smart money” attenuates these anomalies. We find that aggregate flows to mutual funds (dumb money) appear to exacerbate cross-sectional mispricing, particularly for growth, accrual, and momentum anomalies. In contrast, hedge fund flows (smart money) appear to attenuate aggregate mispricing. Our results suggest that aggregate flows to mutual funds can have real adverse allocation effects in the stock market and that aggregate flows to hedge funds contribute to the correction of cross-sectional mispricing.","['Ferhat Akbas', 'Will J.

Trade credit and cross-country predictable firm returns,"We investigate the role of trade credit links in generating cross-border return predictability between international firms. Using data from 43 countries from 1993 to 2009, we find that firms with high trade credit located in producer countries have stock returns that are strongly predictable based on the returns of their associated customer countries. This behavior is especially prevalent among firms with high levels of foreign sales. To better understand this effect we develop an asset pricing model in which firms in different countries are connected by trade credit links. The model offers further predictions about this phenomenon, including stronger predictability during periods of high credit constraints and low uninformed trading volume. We find supportive empirical evidence for these predictions.","['Rui Albuquerque', 'Tarun Ramadorai', 'Sumudu W.

"Excess control rights, bank capital structure adjustments, and lending","We investigate whether excess control rights of ultimate owners in pyramids affect banks׳ capital ratio adjustments. When control and cash flow rights are identical, to boost capital ratios banks issue equity without cutting lending. However, when control rights exceed cash flow rights, instead of issuing equity, banks downsize by reducing lending. Such a finding is mostly prevalent in countries with weak shareholder protection or for family-controlled banks. Other factors also explain the extent to which such banks reduce lending. Our findings contribute to the capital structure adjustment literature and have critical policy implications for the implementation of Basel III and the debate on capital requirements and bank lending.","['Laetitia Lepetit', 'Nadia Saghi-Zedek', 'Amine Tarazi']","['Dynamic capital structure', 'Bank lending', 'Pyramids', 'Excess control rights', 'European banking']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1400213X,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,3
Vulnerable banks,"We present a model in which fire sales propagate shocks across bank balance sheets. When a bank experiences a negative shock to its equity, a natural way to return to target leverage is to sell assets. If potential buyers are limited, then asset sales depress prices, in which case one bank׳s sales impact other banks with common exposures. We show how this contagion effect adds up across the banking sector, and how it can be estimated empirically using balance sheet data. We compute bank exposures to system-wide deleveraging, as well as the spillovers induced by individual banks. Applying the model to European banks, we evaluate a variety of interventions to reduce their vulnerability to fire sales during the sovereign debt crisis.","['Robin Greenwood', 'Augustin Landier', 'David Thesmar']","['Banks', 'Systemic risk', 'Fire sales', 'Price pressure', 'Contagion']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002529,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,3
The impact of Treasury supply on financial sector lending and stability,We present a theory in which the key driver of short-term debt issued by the financial sector is the portfolio demand for safe and liquid assets by the nonfinancial sector. This demand drives a premium on safe and liquid assets that the financial sector exploits by owning risky and illiquid assets and writing safe and liquid claims against them. The central prediction of the theory is that safe and liquid government debt should crowd out financial sector lending financed by short-term debt. We verify this prediction with US data from 1875 to 2014.

A theory of risk capital,We present a theory of risk capital and of how tax and other costs of risk capital should be allocated in a financial firm. Risk capital is equity investment that backs obligations to creditors and other liability holders and maintains the firm׳s credit quality. Credit quality is measured by the ratio of the value of the firm׳s option to default to the default-­free value of its liabilities. Marginal default values provide a full and unique allocation of risk capital. Efficient capital allocations maintain credit quality and preclude risk shifting.

Modeling financial contagion using mutually exciting jump processes,"We propose a model to capture the dynamics of asset returns, with periods of crises that are characterized by contagion. In the model, a jump in one region of the world increases the intensity of jumps both in the same region (self-excitation) as well as in other regions (cross-excitation), generating episodes of highly clustered jumps across world markets that mimic the observed features of the data. We develop and implement moment-based estimation and testing procedures for this model. The estimates provide evidence of self-excitation both in the US and the other world markets, and of asymmetric cross-excitation, with the US market typically having more influence on the jump intensity of other markets than the reverse. We propose filtered values of the jump intensities as a measure of market stress and examine their out-of-sample forecasting abilities.","['Yacine Aït-Sahalia', 'Julio Cacho-Diaz', 'Roger J.A.

The bonding hypothesis of takeover defenses: Evidence from IPO firms,"We propose and test an efficiency explanation for why firms deploy takeover defenses using initial public offering (IPO) firm data. We hypothesize that takeover defenses bond the firm׳s commitments by reducing the likelihood that an outside takeover will change the firm׳s operating strategy and impose costs on its business partners. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that IPO firms deploy more takeover defenses when they have important business relationships to protect. An IPO firm׳s use of takeover defenses is positively related to the longevity of its business relationships. IPO firms’ use of takeover defenses creates positive spillovers for their large customers. And IPO firms’ valuation and subsequent operating performance are positively related to their use of takeover defenses when they have important business relationships.","['William C.

Regression-based estimation of dynamic asset pricing models,"We propose regression-based estimators for beta representations of dynamic asset pricing models with an affine pricing kernel specification. We allow for state variables that are cross-sectional pricing factors, forecasting variables for the price of risk, and factors that are both. The estimators explicitly allow for time-varying prices of risk, time-varying betas, and serially dependent pricing factors. Our approach nests the Fama-MacBeth two-pass estimator as a special case. We provide asymptotic multistage standard errors necessary to conduct inference for asset pricing tests. We illustrate our new estimators in an application to the joint pricing of stocks and bonds. The application features strongly time-varying, highly significant prices of risk that are found to be quantitatively more important than time-varying betas in reducing pricing errors.","['Tobias Adrian', 'Richard K.

The cross section of expected holding period returns and their dynamics: A present value approach,"We provide a tractable model of firm-level expected holding period returns using two firm fundamentals—book-to-market ratio and return on equity—and study the cross-sectional properties of the model-implied expected returns. We find that firm-level expected returns and expected profitability are time-varying but highly persistent and that forecasts of holding period returns strongly predict the cross section of future returns up to three years ahead. We show a highly significant predictive pooled regression slope for future quarterly returns of 0.86. The popular factor-based expected return models have either an insignificant or a significantly negative association with future returns. In supplemental analyses, we show that these forecasts are also informative of the time series variation in aggregate conditions. For a representative firm, the slope of the conditional expected return curve is more positive in good times, when expected short-run returns are relatively low, and the model-implied forecaster of aggregate returns exhibits modest predictive ability. Collectively, we provide a simple, theoretically motivated, and practically useful approach to estimating multi-period-ahead expected returns.","['Matthew R. Lyle', 'Charles C.Y.

We find that banks were willing to pay a premium of around 44 basis points (bps) across funding sources (126 bps after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers) to avoid borrowing from the DW. DW stigma is economically relevant as it increased some banks' borrowing cost by 32 bps of their pre-tax return on assets (ROA) during the crisis.

The positive effect is more pronounced when employees are more important for innovation, when free-riding among employees is weaker, when options are granted broadly to most employees, when the average expiration period of options is longer, and when employee stock ownership is lower. Further analysis reveals that employee stock options foster innovation mainly through the risk-taking incentive, rather than the performance-based incentive created by stock options.","['Xin Chang', 'Kangkang Fu', 'Angie Low', 'Wenrui Zhang']","['Employee stock options', 'Corporate innovation', 'Risk-taking incentives', 'Employee compensation']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1400186X,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,1
Attentive insider trading,"We provide evidence that some profitable insider stock selling is motivated by public information. At firms that disclose having concentrated sales relationships, insiders appear to sell their own stock profitably based on public information about their principal customers. Supplier insiders also sell more stock when public information about their customers׳ recent returns and earnings surprises suggests they will earn larger profits. These results are stronger when outside investor attention could be lower. Outside of this setting, insiders engage in a higher proportion of routine sales and their sales are less profitable.

Empirically, an indicator of optimism based on this idea matches the expected relations between optimism and corporate decision-making better than commonly used indicators based on the timing of option exercise. This makes sense, as our model of an executive׳s optimal option exercise and portfolio choice demonstrates that the timing of option exercise depends just as much on stock and other executive characteristics as it does on optimism.","['Rik Sen', 'Robert Tumarkin']","['Optimism', 'Executive stock option', 'Exercise policy', 'Optimism measures', 'Corporate financial policies']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001403,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,2
The “greatest” carry trade ever? Understanding eurozone bank risks,"We show that eurozone bank risks during 2007–2013 can be understood as carry trade behavior. Bank equity returns load positively on peripheral (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, or GIIPS) bond returns and negatively on German government bond returns, which generated carry until the deteriorating GIIPS bond returns adversely affected bank balance sheets. We find support for risk-shifting and regulatory arbitrage motives at banks in that carry trade behavior is stronger for large banks and banks with low capital ratios and high risk-weighted assets. We also find evidence for home bias and moral suasion in the subsample of GIIPS banks.","['Viral V.

"Suspect CEOs, unethical culture, and corporate misbehavior","We show that firms with Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) who personally benefit from options backdating are more likely to engage in other corporate misbehaviors, suggestive of an unethical corporate culture. These firms are more likely to commit financial fraud to overstate earnings. They acquire more private companies, which could perpetuate their frauds, and their acquisitions are met with lower market responses. These misbehaviors are concentrated in firms with externally hired suspect CEOs, consistent with outside CEOs having greater discretion to shape firm culture. The costs of these misbehaviors are reflected in larger stock price declines during a market correction and increased CEO replacement.","['Lee Biggerstaff', 'David C.

End-of-the-year economic growth and time-varying expected returns,"We show that macroeconomic growth at the end of the year (fourth quarter or December) strongly influences expected returns on risky financial assets, whereas economic growth during the rest of the year does not. We find this pattern for many different asset classes, across different time periods, and for US and international data. We also show that movements in the surplus consumption ratio of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), a theoretically well-founded measure of time-varying risk aversion linked to macroeconomic growth, influence expected returns stronger during the fourth quarter than the other quarters of the year. Our findings suggest that expected returns, risk aversion, and economic growth are particularly related at the end of the year, when we also expect consumers׳ portfolio adjustments to be concentrated.","['Stig V.

"House prices, collateral, and self-employment","We show the importance of the collateral lending channel for small business employment over the past decade. Small businesses in areas with greater increases in house prices experienced stronger growth in employment than large firms in the same areas and industries. To identify the role of the collateral lending channel separately from aggregate changes in demand, we show that this effect is more pronounced in industries that need little start-up capital and in which housing collateral is more important. This increase is also present in manufacturing industries, particularly those that ship goods over long distances. In aggregate, the collateral lending channel explains 15–25% of employment variation.","['Manuel Adelino', 'Antoinette Schoar', 'Felipe Severino']","['Housing', 'Collateral', 'Self-employment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Small business']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1500029X,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,2
Asset pricing with arbitrage activity,"We study an economy populated by three groups of myopic agents: constrained agents subject to a portfolio constraint that limits their risk taking, unconstrained agents subject to a standard nonnegative wealth constraint, and arbitrageurs with access to a credit facility. Such credit is valuable as it allows arbitrageurs to exploit the limited arbitrage opportunities that emerge endogenously in reaction to the demand imbalance generated by the portfolio constraint. The model is solved in closed-form, and we show that, in contrast to existing models with frictions and logarithmic agents, arbitrage activity has an impact on the price level and generates both excess volatility and the leverage effect. We show that these results are due to the fact that arbitrageurs amplify fundamental shocks by levering up in good times and deleveraging in bad times.","['Julien Hugonnier', 'Rodolfo Prieto']","['Limits of arbitrage', 'Rational bubbles', 'Wealth constraints', 'Excess volatility', 'Leverage effect']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002104,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,2
Hedge funds and discretionary liquidity restrictions,"We study hedge funds that imposed discretionary liquidity restrictions (DLRs) on investor shares during the financial crisis. DLRs prolong fund life, but impose liquidity costs on investors, creating a potential conflict of interest. Ostensibly, funds establish DLRs to limit performance-driven withdrawals that could force fire sales of illiquid assets. However, after they restrict investor liquidity, DLR funds do not reduce illiquid stock sales and underperform a control sample of non-DLR funds. Consequently, DLRs appear to negatively impact fund family reputation. After the crisis, funds from DLR families faced difficulties raising capital and were more likely to cut their fees.","['Adam L.

Importing corruption culture from overseas: Evidence from corporate tax evasion in the United States,"We study how cultural norms and enforcement policies influence illicit corporate activities. Using confidential Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit data, we show that corporations with owners from countries with higher corruption norms evade more tax in the U.S. This effect is strong for small corporations and decreases as the size of the corporation increases. In the mid-2000s, the United States implemented several enforcement measures to increase tax compliance. We find that these enforcement efforts were less effective in reducing tax evasion by corporations whose owners are from corrupt countries. This suggests that cultural norms can be a challenge to legal enforcement.","['Jason DeBacker', 'Bradley T.

Competition of the informed: Does the presence of short sellers affect insider selling?,"We study how the presence of short sellers affects the incentives of the insiders to trade on negative information. We show it induces insiders to sell more (shares from their existing stakes) and trade faster to preempt the potential competition from short sellers. An experiment and instrumental variable analysis confirm this causal relationship. The effects are stronger for “opportunistic” (i.e., more informed) insider trades and when short sellers׳ attention is high. Return predictability of insider sales only occurs in stocks with high short-selling potential, suggesting that short sellers indirectly enhance the speed of information dissemination by accelerating trading by insiders.","['Massimo Massa', 'Wenlan Qian', 'Weibiao Xu', 'Hong Zhang']","['Short selling', 'Insider trading', 'Informed trader', 'Market efficiency']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001439,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,2
Do investors overpay for stocks with lottery-like payoffs? An examination of the returns of OTC stocks,"We study returns on over-the-counter stocks and find that these returns are extremely negative on average. The distribution of OTC stock returns is highly positively skewed: while many of the stocks in our sample become worthless, a few do extremely well. We investigate whether this negative return premium can be rationalized by investors׳ preference for positively skewed payoffs. We show that the equilibrium model of Barberis and Huang (2008) provides a plausible explanation for the negative returns. We also show that OTC stocks that once traded on the regular exchanges perform much better than stocks that originate in the OTC markets.","['Bjørn Eraker', 'Mark Ready']","['Prospect theory', 'Skewness', 'Lottery stocks', 'OTCBB']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002372,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,3
The risk premia embedded in index options,"We study the dynamic relation between market risks and risk premia using time series of index option surfaces. We find that priced left tail risk cannot be spanned by market volatility (and its components) and introduce a new tail factor. This tail factor has no incremental predictive power for future volatility and jump risks, beyond current and past volatility, but is critical in predicting future market equity and variance risk premia. Our findings suggest a wide wedge between the dynamics of market risks and their compensation, which typically displays a far more persistent reaction following market crises.","['Torben G.

CEO network centrality and merger performance,"We study the effects on M&A outcomes of CEO network centrality, which measures the extent and strength of a CEO׳s personal connections. High network centrality can allow CEOs to efficiently gather and control private information, facilitating value-creating acquisition decisions. We show, however, that M&A deals initiated by high-centrality CEOs, in addition to being more frequent, carry greater value losses to both the acquirer and the combined entity than deals initiated by low-centrality CEOs. We also document that high-centrality CEOs are capable of avoiding the discipline of the markets for corporate control and the executive labor market, and that the mitigating effect of internal governance on CEO actions is limited. Our evidence suggests that corporate decisions can be influenced by a CEO׳s position in the social hierarchy, with high-centrality CEOs using their power and influence to increase entrenchment and reap private benefits.","['Rwan El-Khatib', 'Kathy Fogel', 'Tomas Jandik']","['Network centrality', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Corporate governance', 'Corporate control market', 'Managerial labor market']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000021,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,2
"Market run-ups, market freezes, inventories, and leverage","We study trade between an informed seller and an uninformed buyer who have existing inventories of assets similar to those being traded. We show that these inventories could induce the buyer to increase the price (a run-up) but could also make trade impossible (a freeze) and hamper information dissemination. Competition can amplify the run-up by inducing buyers to purchase assets at a loss to prevent competitors from purchasing at lower prices and releasing bad news about inventories. In a dynamic extension, we show that a market freeze could be preceded by high prices. Finally, we discuss empirical and policy implications.","['Philip Bond', 'Yaron Leitner']","['Adverse selection', 'Financial crisis', 'Capital constraints', 'Marking to market', 'Inventories']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001834,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,1
The value of corporate culture,"We study which dimensions of corporate culture are related to a firm׳s performance and why. We find that proclaimed values appear irrelevant. Yet, when employees perceive top managers as trustworthy and ethical, a firm׳s performance is stronger. We then study how different governance structures impact the ability to sustain integrity as a corporate value. We find that publicly traded firms are less able to sustain it. Traditional measures of corporate governance do not seem to have much of an impact.","['Luigi Guiso', 'Paola Sapienza', 'Luigi Zingales']","['Corporate culture', 'Integrity', 'Going public']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001147,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,1
Structured debt ratings: Evidence on conflicts of interest,"We test if issuers of asset- and mortgage-backed securities receive rating favors from agencies with which they maintain strong business relationships. Controlling for issuer fixed effects and a large set of credit risk determinants, we show that agencies publish better ratings for those issuers that provide them with more bilateral securitization business. Such rating favors are larger for very complex structured debt deals and for deals issued during the credit boom period. Our analysis is based on a new deal-level rating statistic that accounts for the full distribution of tranche ratings below the AAA cut-off point of a structured debt deal.","['Matthias Efing', 'Harald Hau']","['Credit ratings', 'Ratings inflation', 'Conflict of interest', 'Structured debt']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002554,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,1
Capital allocation and delegation of decision-making authority within firms,"We use a unique data set that contains information on more than 1,000 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) around the world to investigate the degree to which executives delegate financial decisions and the circumstances that drive variation in delegation. Delegation does not appear to be monolithic; instead, our results show that it varies across corporate policies and also varies with the personal characteristics of the CEO. We find that CEOs delegate financial decisions for which they need the most input, when they are overloaded, and when they are distracted by recent acquisitions. CEOs delegate less when they are knowledgeable (long-tenured or with a finance background). Capital is allocated based on “gut feel” and the personal reputation of the manager running a given division. Finally, corporate politics and corporate socialism affect capital allocation in European and Asian firms.","['John R. Graham', 'Campbell R.

Central clearing and collateral demand,"We use an extensive data set of bilateral credit default swap (CDS) positions to estimate the impact on collateral demand of new clearing and margin regulations. The estimated collateral demands include initial margin and the frictional demands associated with the movement of variation margin through the network of market participants. We estimate the impact on total collateral demand of more widespread initial margin requirements, increased novation of CDS to central clearing parties (CCPs), an increase in the number of clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized and non-specialized types, collateral rehypothecation practices, and client clearing. System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared. Given these dealer-to-dealer initial margin requirements, mandatory central clearing is shown to lower, not raise, system-wide collateral demand, provided there is no significant proliferation of CCPs. Central clearing does, however, have significant distributional consequences for collateral requirements across market participants.","['Darrell Duffie', 'Martin Scheicher', 'Guillaume Vuillemey']","['Central clearing party', 'Margin', 'Credit default swap', 'Collateral', 'Client clearing']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14002761,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,2
Does realized skewness predict the cross-section of equity returns?,We use intraday data to compute weekly realized moments for equity returns and study their time-series and cross-sectional properties. Buying stocks in the lowest realized skewness decile and selling stocks in the highest realized skewness decile generates an average return of 19 basis points the following week with a t-statistic of 3.70. This result is robust across a wide variety of implementations and is not captured by the Fama-French and Carhart factors. The relation between realized kurtosis and next week׳s stock returns is positive but not always significant. We do not find a strong relation between realized volatility and next week׳s stock returns.,"['Diego Amaya', 'Peter Christoffersen', 'Kris Jacobs', 'Aurelio Vasquez']","['Realized volatility', 'Skewness', 'Kurtosis', 'Equity markets', 'Cross-section of stock returns']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15001257,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,118,1
Female leadership and gender equity: Evidence from plant closure,"We use unique worker-plant matched panel data to measure differences in wage changes experienced by workers displaced from closing plants. We observe larger losses among women than men, comparing workers who move from the same closing plant to the same new firm. However, we find a significantly smaller gap in hiring firms with female leadership. The results are strongest among women who are displaced from male-led plants and from less competitive industries. Our results suggest an important externality to having women in leadership positions: They cultivate more female-friendly cultures inside their firms.","['Geoffrey Tate', 'Liu Yang']","['Corporate culture', 'Managerial style', 'Female leadership', 'Gender wage gap']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1400018X,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,117,1
"Contractual incompleteness, limited liability and asset price bubbles","When should we expect bubbles? Can levered intermediaries bid up risky asset prices through asset substitution? We study an economy with financial intermediaries that issue debt and equity to buy risky assets. Asset substitution alone cannot cause bubbles because it is priced into the intermediaries׳ securities. But incomplete contracts and managerial agency problems can make intermediaries take excessive risk to exploit limited liability, bidding up risky asset prices. This destroys welfare through misallocation of resources. We argue that incentives for private monitoring cannot solve this problem. Finally, even without agency problems, debt subsidies will create similar effects.","['James Dow', 'Jungsuk Han']","['Leverage', 'Limited liability', 'Bubbles', 'Contractual incompleteness', 'Asset substitution']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X15000070,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,116,2
Why do term structures in different currencies co-move?,"Yield curve fluctuations across different currencies are highly correlated. This paper investigates this phenomenon by exploring the channels through which macroeconomic shocks are transmitted across borders. Macroeconomic shocks affect current and expected future short-term rates as central banks react to changing economic environments. Investors could also respond to these shocks by altering their required compensation for risk. Macroeconomic shocks thus influence bond yields both through a policy channel and through a risk compensation channel. Using data from the US, the UK, and Germany, we find that world inflation and US yield level together explain over two-thirds of the covariance of yields at all maturities. Further, these effects operate largely through the risk compensation channel for long-term bonds.","['Chotibhak Jotikasthira', 'Anh Le', 'Christian Lundblad']","['Macro-finance term structure model', 'Interest rates', 'Cross-country co-movement']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X14001883,Journal of Financial Economics,2015,115,1
