Stock return seasonalities and the tax-loss selling hypothesis,"A ‘tax-loss selling’ hypothesis has frequently been advanced to explain the ‘January effect’ reported in this issue by Keim. This paper concludes that U.S. tax laws do not unambiguously predict such an effect. Since Australia has similar tax laws but a July–June tax year, the hypothesis predicts a small-firm July premium. Australian returns show pronounced December–January and July–August seasonals, and a premium for the smallest-firm decile of about four percent per month across all months. This contrasts with the U.S. data in which the small-firm premium is concentrated in January. We conclude that the relation between the U.S. tax year and the January seasonal may be more correlation than causation.","['Philip Brown', 'Donald B. Keim', 'Allan W. Kleidon', 'Terry A.

Examining antitrust policy towards horizontal mergers,"A horizontal merger must result in higher product prizes to consumers to be anticompetitive or socially inefficient. Higher product prices, however, imply increased profits for rivals to the merging firms. Therefore, if a horizontal merger is to reduce consumer welfare, rival firms must rise in value at the time of events increasing the probability of the merger and fall in value when the probability of the merger declines. this paper uses daily stock return data from a sample of rivals to 11 horizontal mergers attempted between 1964 and 1972 that were challenged by the antitrust enforcement agencies. The paper tests the hypothesis that, but for the government's action, these mergers would have resulted in higher product prices. On balance, the data favor the null hypothesis of no anticompetitive effect.",['Robert Stillman'],[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900120,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,11,1
An empirical investigation of the impact of ‘antitakeover’ amendments on common stock prices,"‘Antitakeover’ amendments are amendments to a corporation's charter that impede the ability of an ‘outsider’ to gain control of the firm. A number of individuals and institutions have onjected to such amendments on the grounds that they are not in the best interests of the shareholders of the firms that adopt them. This paper employs event-time methodology to investigate the impact of antitakeover amendments on the common stock prices of firms that adopt them. The results indicate that the announcement of such amendments is associated with a positive revaluation of stock price. Contrary to the concerns of their critics, we conclude that antitakeover amendments are proposed by managers who seek to increase the value of the firm and are approved by stockholders who share that objective.","['Scott C.

Option pricing in a lognormal securities market with discrete trading,In a recent paper Lee et al. derive a pricing formula which is significantly different from that of Black and Scholes.

Antitakeover charter amendments and stockholder wealth,"Many large corporations have recently adopted antitakeover charter amendments which make the transfer of corporate control more difficult. This paper develops and tests competing theoretical explanations for the passage of these amendments. In one view, antitakeover provisions are adopted because incumbent management seeks job protection at stockholders' expense. The alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover provisions benefit stockholders, perhaps by extracting greater payment in exchange for corporate control. Although inconclusive, the evidence provides weak preliminary support for the hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are best explained as a device for managerial entrenchment.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Edward M.

The effect of pre-emptive right amendments on shareholder wealth,"Pre-emptive rights allow existing shareholders to purchase a new offering of shares before the general public. This paper investigates the effect on shareholder wealth of removing pre-emptive rights from corporate charters. Two hypotheses are constrasted: (1) Shareholder wealth maximization suggests that management uses this extra degree of freedom to pick the least cost method for raising new equity; hence, the amendment increases shareholder wealth. (2) Management welfare maximization holds that management will use the passage of the amendment to maximize their own welfare, sometimes to the detriment of shareholders; hence, the amendment decreases shareholder wealth. The evidence indicates that the amendment decreases shareholder wealth.",['Sanjai Bhagat'],[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8390051X,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,12,3
Biases in computed returns,"Previous estimates of a ‘size effect’ based on daily returns data are biased. The use of quoted closing prices in computing returns on individual stocks imparts an upward bias. Returns computed for buy-and-hold portfolios largely avoid the bias induced by closing prices. Based on such buy-and-hold returns, the full-year size effect is half as large as previously reported, and all of the full-year effect is, on average, due to the month of January.","['Marshall E.

Factor pricing in a finite economy,"Prior theoretical derivations of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) bound an aggregate measure of the deviation of mean asset returns from that predicted by a linear pricing equation. It is conceivable, given this bound, that some assets might be badly mispriced by the model. In this paper, a more intuitive derivation of the factor pricing equation is presented which describes the deviation on an asset by asset basis. The deviation is shown to be small for assets in a realistic finite economy and is arbitrarily close to zero for those assets with arbitrarily small size relative to aggregate wealth. It follows that the linear pricing equation provides a good approximation for the mean returns of all traded assets.","['Mark Grinblatt', 'Sheridan Titman']",[],[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900466,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,12,4
Transaction costs and the small firm effect,"Recent empirical work by Banz (1981) and Reinganum (1981) documents abnormally large risk-adjusted returns for small firms listed on the NYSE and the AMEX. The strength and persistence with which the returns appear lead both authors to conclude the single-period, two-parameter capital asset pricing model is misspecified. This study (1) confirms that total market value of common stock equity varies inversely with risk-adjusted returns, (2) demonstrates that price per share does also, and (3) finds that transaction costs at least partially account for the abnormality.","['Hans R.

An explicit bound on individual assets' deviations from APT pricing in a finite economy,"Ross's Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) is a tractible and reasonable alternative to the mean-variance model. Nonetheless, understanding of the theory has been obscured by the complexity of the sequence economy models used for motivation. By contrast, we give a simple and direct derivation of the APT in a finite economy. Using an explicit bound on the deviations from APT prices across assets, a coarse calculation shows that theoretical deviations from APT pricing are negligible in our economy.",['Philip H.

Assessing competition in the market for corporate acquisitions,"Several studies of mergers and tender offers examine the changes in the value of ownership claims associated with corporate acquisitions and use the observed value changes to address the degree of competition in the market for corporate acquisitions. These studies conclude that the takeover market is competitive on the basis of the abnormal stock price changes of bidding firms, the time series behavior of the market value of target firms, and the proportion of gains that accrue to target and bidding firms. Unfortunately, none of these tests are sufficient to conclude that the takeover market is competitive. A competitive acquisition market implies that the potential gain to unsuccessful bidders at the successful offer price is nonpositive. This implication is tested using data on tender offers in which there are multiple bidders. The results appear to be consistent with competition in the market for corporate acquisitions.",['Richard S.

The anomalous stock market behavior of small firms in January,"Small firms experience large returns in January and exceptionally large returns during the first few trading days of January. The empirical tests indicate that the abnormally high returns witnessed at the very beginning of January appear to be consistent with tax-loss selling. However, tax-loss selling cannot explain the entire January seasonal effect. The small firms least likely to be sold for tax reasons (prior year ‘winners’) also exhibit large average January returns, although not unusually large returns during the first few days of January.",['Marc R.

"Standstill agreements, privately negotiated stock repurchases, and the market for corporate control","Standstill agreements are voluntary contracts which limit a substantial stockholder's ownership interest in a corporation for a specified number of years. They are often accompanied by repurchase of the substantial stockholder's shares at a premium above the market price. Standstills and premium buybacks reduce competition for corporate control and provide differential treatment of large block stockholders. The analysis indicates a statistically significant negative average effect on non-participating stockholder wealth associated with standstill agreements. Negotiated premium repurchases are also associated with negative, but less significant, stockholder returns. The evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that these management actions are in the best interests of non-participating stockholders.","['Larry Y.

Transaction costs and the small firm effect,"Stoll and Whaley (1983) suggest large transaction costs may be responsible for the large risk-adjusted returns earned by small firm stocks.

Arbitrage pricing with information,"The Arbitrage Pricing Theory is extended to a setting where investors possess information about future asset returns. A no-arbitrage pricing restriction is obtained with arbitrage conditioned on an investor's information. The pricing restriction contains unconditional factor loadings and either conditional or unconditional expected returns. Thus, tests of the theory can be based solely on time-series estimates of unconditional moments. Additional tests based on conditional expected returns are also appropriate.",['Robert F.

"The relationship between earnings' yield, market value and return for NYSE common stocks","The empirical relationship between earnings' yield, firm size and returns on the common stock of NYSE firms is examined in this paper. The results confirm that the common stock of high E/P firms earn, on average, higher risk-adjusted returns than the common stock of low E/P firms and that this effect is clearly significant even if experimental control is exercised over differences in firm size. On the other hand, while the common stock of small NYSE firms appear to have earned substantially higher returns than the common stock of large NYSE firms, the size effect virtually disappears when returns are controlled for differences in risk and E/P ratios. The evidence presented here indicates that the E/P effect, however, is not entirely independent of firm size and that the effect of both variables on expected returns is considerably more complicated than previously documented in the literature.",['Sanjoy Basu'],[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900314,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,12,1
On computing mean returns and the small firm premium,"The mean return computational method has a substantial effect on the estimated small firm premium. The buy-and-hold method, which best mimics actual investment experience, produces an estimated small-firm premium only one-half as large as the arithmetic and re-balanced methods which are often used in empirical studies. Similar biases can be expected in mean returns when securities are classified by any variable related to trading volume.",['Richard Roll'],[],[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900557,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,12,3
"Banks, firms and the relative pricing of tax-exempt and taxable bonds",The traditional analysis of the relative pricing of tax-exempt and taxable debt is a habitat theory of the term structure of interest rates. In the traditional analysis the preferences of investors for particular maturities of debt lead to unique pricing relations at every point on the yield curve which are indicative of investor marginal tax brackets. Recent work by Fama (1977) suggests that banks are potential arbitrageurs across tax-exempt and taxable bond markets which force a particular equilibrium on the pricing of short-term bonds. Miller (1977) suggests that the choice of debt or equity financing by firms in the aggregate forces a similar equilibrium on the pricing of all tax-exempt and taxable bonds. This paper exploits the institution of Regulation Q and its effects on the banking system to bring evidence to bear on the predictions of these three models.,['Jeffrey L.

Friction in the trading process and the estimation of systematic risk,"This paper considers how estimates of the market model beta parameter can be biased by friction in the trading process (information, decision, and transaction costs) that (a) leads to a distinction between observed and ‘true’ returns; (b) causes observed returns to be generated asynchronously for a set of interdependent securities; and (c) thereby introduces serial cross-correlation into security returns. Several propositions are derived from which consistent estimators of beta are obtained, and the effect of differencing interval length on beta estimates is specified. The formulation is contrasted with the related analyses of Scholes-Williams (1977) and Dimson (1979).","['Kalman J. Cohen', 'Gabriel A. Hawawini', 'Steven F. Maier', 'Robert A. Schwartz', 'David K.

Warrant valuation and exercise strategy,"This paper demonstrates that warrant valuation and exercise strategy differ fundamentally from call option valuation. Simultaneous exercise of warrants is shown to be suboptimal and a monopolist owning all warrants can achieve a higher value. Unless warrants are perfectly divisible, no satisfactory equilibrium exists for the valuation and exercise of widely held warrants. The problems encountered appear to be quite general and stem from necessary assumptions about future corporate dividend policy and capital structure. Such assumptions are necessary for any model of corporate security valuation.",['David C.

Valuation of asset leasing contracts,"This paper describes the relation among a variety of asset leasing contracts, including: (1) cancellable operating leases; (2) leases which grant the lesse an option to extend the life of the lease; (3) leases that grant the lessee an option to purchase the leased asset at a fixed price at the maturity date of the lease; (4) leases that grant the lessee the right to purchase the leased asset at its ‘fair market value’ at the maturity date of the lease; (5) leases that grant an option to the lessee to purchase the leased asset at a prespecified price anytime during the life of the lease; (6) leases that require the lessee to purchase the leased asset at a fixed price at the maturity date of the lease; and (7) leases that contain non-cancellation provisions. The paper uses a compound option pricing framework to develop a general model for valuing (or evaluating) each of the types of leasing contracts. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of the various elements of a leasing contract — including cancellation risk and residual value risk — on equilibrium rental payments.","['John J.

On corporate governance,"This paper examines a sample of firms experiencing proxy contests for seats on their board of directors. Dissident shareholders usually fail to obtain a majority of board seats. Nevertheless, they capture some seats, via mechanisms such as cumulative voting, in over half of the sample contests. Regardless of proxy contest outcome, positive and statistically significant share price performance is associated with the contest. That finding is predicted by the standard economic analysis of proxy contests, in which the challenges benefit shareholders by improving corporate performance. The finding runs counter to the claim of Berle (1962) that the economists' view of proxy contests is ‘a wholly imaginary picture’. A portion of the positive share price changes taking place in the early stages of some proxy contests is not permanent, however, and as suggested by Manne (1962) is at least partially attributable to temporary increases in the market value of the vote attached to corporate shares.","['Peter Dodd', 'Jerold B.

"Shareholder wealth, information signaling and the specially designated dividend","This paper examines common stock returns and dividend and earnings patterns surrounding specially designated dividends labeled by management as ‘extra’, ‘special’ or ‘year-end’ and compares them to those surrounding regular (unlabeled) dividend increases. The results support the notion that management uses the labeling of dividend increases to convey information to the market about the future potential of the firm. Unlabeled increases appear to contain the most positive information. Contrary to the sometimes suggested view, specially designated dividends appear to convey positive information about future dividends and earnings beyond that relating to the current period.",['James A.

The wealth effects of targeted share repurchases,"This paper examines the wealth impact of share repurchases that restrict participation to a particular sub-set of a firm's stockholders. Repurchases at a premium from insiders and small shareholders increase the wealth of non-participating stockholders and are therefore consistent with the shareholders' interest hypothesis. However, privately negotiated repurchases of single blocks from stockholders unaffiliated with the firm reduce the wealth of non-participating stockholders. In contrast to the evidence for general repurchases, no positive wealth effect offsets the significant repurchase premium paid to the selling stockholder. Indeed, the wealth loss to non-participating stockholders is significantly greater than the premium paid. This evidence is inconsistent with the shareholders' interest hypothesis and supports the hypothesis that managers in their self-interest use single block repurchases to eliminate threats to their control over the firm's resources.","['Michael Bradley', 'L.Macdonald Wakeman']",[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900156,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,11,1
Effects of recontracting on shareholder wealth,This paper investigates the effect of voluntary corporate spin-off announcements on shareholder wealth.

The rationale behind interfirm tender offers,"This paper investigates the rationale behind interfirm tender offers by examining the returns realized by the stockholders of firms that were the targets of unsuccessful tender offers and firms that have made unsuccessful offers. Our results suggest that the permanent positive revaluation of the unsuccessful target shares [documented by Dodd and Ruback (1977) and Bradley (1980)] is due primarily to the emergence of and/or the anticipation of another bid that would ultimately result in the transfer of control of the target resources. We also find that the rejection of a tender offer has differential effects on the share prices of the unsuccessful bidding firms depending upon whether the tender offer process results in a change in the control of target resources. On the basis of these results we conclude that acquisitions via tender offers are attempts by bidding firms to exploit potential synergies, not simply superior information regarding the ‘true’ value of the target resources.","['Michael Bradley', 'Anand Desai', 'E.Han Kim']",[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900107,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,11,1
New evidence on the nature of size-related anomalies in stock prices,"This paper is concerned with the size-related anomalies in stock returns reported by Banz (1981) and Reinganum (1981). They showed that small firms have tended to yield returns greater than those predicted by the traditional CAPM. We find that the size effect is linear in the logarithm of size, but reject the hypothesis that the ex ante excess return attributable to size is stable through time. We briefly analyze the Seemingly Unrelated Regression Model (SURM) and a two-step procedure as two alternative estimators of the size effect. Due to the instability of the effect, we find that the estimates are sensitive to the time period studied.","['Philip Brown', 'Allan W. Kleidon', 'Terry A.

Transactions data tests of efficiency of the Chicago board options exchange,"This paper performs lower boundary condition tests based on rational pricing of call options and an implied standard deviation test based on the bid/ask prices of options. These efficiency tests attempt to closely approximate conditions in the option markets to avoid the pitfalls indicated by Phillips and Smith (1980). The tests use transactions data and account for the effects of stock and option bid/ask prices, simultaneity of stock and option prices, depth of market, execution lag and transaction costs. The small and relatively infrequent profits due to market mispricing disappear in the lower boundary tests when transaction costs are taken into account. Frequent violations of the tighter boundary conditions in the implied standard deviation test are reported, but the estimated profits cannot be unambiguously attributed to option market inefficiency.",['Mihir Bhattacharya'],[],[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8390034X,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,12,2
The costs of antimerger lawsuits,"This paper presents tests of the hypothesis that the relief imposed in antimerger cases is costly for defendant firms' stockholders. Previous research on this subject suggests that defendants' case-related losses are due entirely to legal expenses and the disruption of productive activity. In this paper it is shown that two out of five portfolios of defendant firms earn abnormal losses when final decisions in antimerger cases are announced. These losses are consistent with the imposition of costly constraints on some defendants by government antitrust enforcers. The tests also show that when acquisitions are canceled following antimerger complaints, the losses to the target firms are substantial and completely offset the gains generated when the acquisitions are proposed.",['Peggy Wier'],[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900119,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,11,1

The evidence indicates that corporate takeovers generate positive gains, that target firm shareholders benefit, and that bidding firm shareholders do not lose. The gains created by corporate takeovers do not appear to come from the creation of market power. With the exception of actions that exclude potential bidders, it is difficult to find managerial actions related to corporate control that harm shareholders. Finally, we argue the market for corporate control is best viewed as an arena in which managerial teams compete for the rights to manage corporate resources.","['Michael C. Jensen', 'Richard S.

The wealth effect of merger activity and the objective functions of merging firms,"This paper studies the net effects of the long-run sequence of events leading to merger, and of merger per se, on shareholder wealth. The appropriate measure of the wealth effect is shown to be the abnormal dollar return cumulated over time. Using this measure, the long-run wealth effect of the event sequence culminating in merger is significantly negative for acquiring firms. For acquired firms, the effect is negative, but not significant. The immediate impact of merger per se is positive and highly significant for acquired firms but larger in absolute value, and negative for acquiring firms. The evidence also reveals that measured abnormal rates of return to acquiring firms are sensitive to a slight variation in model specification and dependent on firm size, with smaller firms earning significantly negative post-merger returns.",['Paul H.

Under the collusion hypothesis, rivals of the merging firms benefit from the merger since successful collusion limits output and raises product prices and/or lower factor prices. This proposition is tested on a large sample of horizontal mergers in mining and manufacturing industries, including mergers challenged by the government with violating antitrust laws, and a ‘control’ sample of vertical mergers taking place in the same industries. While we find that the antitrust law enforcement agencies systematically select relatively profitable mergers for prosecution, there is little evidence indicating that the mergers would have had collusive, anticompetitive effects.",['B.Espen Eckbo'],[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900132,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,11,1

For 26 firms that had two classes of common stock outstanding, the class with superior voting rights traded at a premium relative to the other class. However, in four firms where the ownership structure of the firm also included a class of voting preferred stock, the class of common with superior voting rights traded at a significant discount relative to the class of common with inferior voting rights.

Evidence is provided that there are strong seasonalities in the stock market return distributions in most of the capital markets around the world.

The gains to bidding firms from merger,"This study examines the effect of mergers on the wealth of bidding firms' shareholders. Bidding firms gain significantly during the twenty-one days leading to the announcement of each of their first four merger bids. These results fail to support the capitalization hypothesis that bidders' gains are captured at the beginning of merger programs. Bidders' abnormal returns are positively related to the relative size of the merger partners, and the gains during the announcement period are larger for mergers which are successful. Though the gains are larger prior to 1969, merger bids after 1969 also significantly increase the wealth of bidding firms' shareholders. The results suggest that the inconclusive findings of the earlier studies may be due to methodological deficiencies.

In particular, nearly fifty percent of the average magnitude of the ‘size effect’ over the period 1963–1979 is due to January abnormal returns.

Security price reactions around corporate spin-off announcements,We examine security price reactions around the announcements of 123 voluntary spin-offs by 116 firms between 1963 and 1981 involving a pro-rata distribution of the common stock of a subsidiary to the stockholders of the parent firm. The median spin-off in the sample is 6.6% of the original equity value and is associated with an abnormal return of 7.0% from 50 days prior to the announcement through completion of the spin-off. No evidence is found to indicate the gains to stockholders represent wealth transfers from senior securityholders. Over the entire event period we find positive gains for firms engaging in spin-offs to facilitate mergers or to separate diverse operating units but negative returns to firms responding to legal and/or regulatory difficulties. In the two-day interval surrounding the first press announcement we find positive average excess returns for all groups.,"['Gailen L. Hite', 'James E.

Evidence on the capitalized value of merger activity for acquiring firms,"We measure the impact of acquisitions activity on firm value by differentiating between specific merger events and programs of acquisition activity. Based on a sample of conglomerate acquirers, we find significantly positive abnormal performance associated with the announcement of acquisitions programs and significantly negative performance associated with certain institutional changes of 1967–1970 relating to acquisition activity (the Williams Amendments, the 1969 Tax Reform Act, and APB Opinions 16 and 17). Our results support the hypotheses that acquisitions activity had a favorable ex ante impact on the value of firms announcing an intention to engage in acquisitions, and that some of the institutional changes reduced the expected profitability of future acquisitions activity. The basic results of studies of mergers and tender offers are reviewed and their consistency with our findings highlighted.","['Katherine Schipper', 'Rex Thompson']",[],[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X83900065,Journal of Financial Economics,1983,11,1
Risk measurement when shares are subject to infrequent trading,"When securities are thinly traded OLS techniques yield biased beta estimates. Procedures for calculating consistent estimates are proposed by Scholes and Williams (1977) and by Dimson (1979). This comment examines both procedures and concludes that the Dimson procedure is incorrect and cannot generally be expected to yield consistent beta estimates. However, a variant of this procedure can yield results which are identical to Scholes and Williams' and is, therefore, correct.","['David J.
