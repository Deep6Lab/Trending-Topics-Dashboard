Empirical analysis of corporate tax reforms: What is the null and where did it come from?,"Absent theoretical guidance, empiricists have been forced to rely upon numerical comparative statics from constant tax rate models in formulating testable implications of tradeoff theory in the context of natural experiments. We fill the theoretical void by solving in closed-form a dynamic tradeoff theoretic model in which corporate taxes follow a Markov process with exogenous rate changes. We simulate ideal difference-in-differences estimations, finding that constant tax rate models offer poor guidance regarding testable implications. While constant rate models predict large symmetric responses to rate changes, our model with stochastic tax rates predicts small, asymmetric, and often statistically insignificant responses. Even with very long regimes (one decade), under plausible parameterizations, the true underlying theory‚Äîthat taxes matter‚Äîis incorrectly rejected in about half the simulated natural experiments. Moreover, tax response coefficients are actually smaller in simulated economies with larger tax-induced welfare losses.","['Christopher A. Hennessy', 'Akitada Kasahara', 'Ilya A.

Leveraged buyouts and bond credit spreads,"Recent decades have witnessed several waves of buyout activity. We find leveraged buyouts (LBOs) to be a significant concern for bondholders by showing that a) intra-industry credit spreads increase upon an LBO announcement, b) yields on bonds without event risk covenants are, on average, 21 basis points higher than those on same-firm bonds with such covenants, and c) structural models calibrated to historical LBO events imply an impact of 18‚Äì21 basis points on 10-year credit spreads. The impact is strongest in expansion periods and for bonds with maturities of 10‚Äì20 years.","['Yael Eisenthal-Berkovitz', 'Peter Feldh√ºtter', 'Vikrant Vig']","['Credit spreads', 'LBO risk', 'Structural models', 'Leveraged buyouts']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301801,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Do fire sales create externalities?,"We develop three novel measures of the incentives of equity mutual funds to internalize the price impact of their trading. We show that mutual funds with stronger incentives to internalize their price impact accommodate inflows and outflows by adjusting their cash buffers instead of trading in portfolio securities. As a result, stocks held by these funds have lower volatility, and flows out of these funds have smaller spillover effects on other funds holding the same securities. Our results provide evidence of meaningful fire sale externalities in the equity mutual fund industry.","['Sergey Chernenko', 'Adi Sunderam']","['Fire sales', 'Liquidity management', 'Mutual funds']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301928,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Betting against correlation: Testing theories of the low-risk effect,"We test whether the low-risk effect is driven by leverage constraints and, thus, risk should be measured using beta versus behavioral effects and, thus, risk should be measured by idiosyncratic risk. Beta depends on volatility and correlation, with only volatility related to idiosyncratic risk. We introduce a new betting against correlation (BAC) factor that is particularly suited to differentiate between leverage constraints and behavioral explanations. BAC produces strong performance in the US and internationally, supporting leverage constraint theories. Similarly, we construct the new factor SMAX to isolate lottery demand, which also produces positive returns. Consistent with both leverage and lottery theories contributing to the low-risk effect, we find that BAC is related to margin debt while idiosyncratic risk factors are related to sentiment.","['Cliff Asness', 'Andrea Frazzini', 'Niels Joachim Gormsen', 'Lasse Heje Pedersen']","['Asset pricing', 'Leverage constraints', 'Lottery demand', 'Margin', 'Sentiment']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930176X,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Are early stage investors biased against women?,"We study whether early stage investors have gender biases using a proprietary data set from AngelList that allows us to observe private interactions between investors and fundraising startups. We find that male investors express less interest in female entrepreneurs compared to observably similar male entrepreneurs. In contrast, female investors express more interest in female entrepreneurs. These findings do not appear to be driven by within-gender screening/monitoring advantages or gender differences in risk preferences. Moreover, the male-led startups that male investors express interest in do not outperform the female-led startups they express interest in‚Äîthey underperform. Overall, the evidence is consistent with gender biases.","['Michael Ewens', 'Richard R.

Employment effects of unconventional monetary policy: Evidence from QE,"This paper investigates employment effects of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs quantitative easing policies (QE) via a bank lending channel. We find that banks with higher mortgage-backed securities holdings refinanced relatively more mortgages after the first round of QE, which increased local consumption and employment in the nontradable goods sector. In contrast, banks increased lending to firms and home purchase mortgage origination after the third round of QE, which led to a sizable increase in overall employment. Our findings are supported by new confidential loan-level data that show firms with stronger ties to affected banks increased employment and capital investment more during QE3.","['Stephan Luck', 'Tom Zimmermann']","['Bank lending channel', 'Quantitative easing']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301771,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Governance through shame and aspiration: Index creation and corporate behavior,"After decades of de-prioritizing shareholders‚Äô economic interests and low corporate profitability, Japan introduced the JPX-Nikkei400 in 2014. The index highlighted the country‚Äôs ‚Äúbest-run‚Äù companies by annually selecting the 400 most profitable of its large and liquid firms. We find that managers competed for inclusion in the index by significantly increasing return on equity (ROE), and they did so at least in part due to their reputational or status concerns. The ROE increase was predominantly driven by improvements in margins, which were in turn partially driven by cutting research and development (R&D) intensity. Our findings suggest that indexes can affect managerial behavior through reputational or status incentives.","['Akash Chattopadhyay', 'Matthew D. Shaffer', 'Charles C.Y.

"Left-tail momentum: Underreaction to bad news, costly arbitrage and equity returns","This paper documents a significantly negative cross-sectional relation between left-tail risk and future returns on individual stocks trading in the US and international countries. We provide a behavioral explanation to this anomaly based on the idea that investors underestimate the persistence in left-tail risk and overprice stocks with large recent losses. Thus, low returns in the left-tail of the distribution persist into the future causing left-tail return momentum. We find that the left-tail risk anomaly is stronger for stocks that are more likely to be held by retail investors, that receive less investor attention, and that are costlier to arbitrage.","['Yigit Atilgan', 'Turan G.

Pricing structured products with economic covariates,We introduce a top-down no-arbitrage model for pricing structured products. Losses are described by Cox processes whose intensities depend on economic variables. The model provides economic insight into the impact of structured products on financial institutions‚Äô risk exposure and systemic risk. We estimate the model using CDO data and find that spreads decrease with higher interest rates and increase with volatility and leverage. Volatility is the primary determinant of variation in tranche spreads. Leverage and interest rates are more closely associated with rare credit events. Model-implied risk premiums and the probabilities of tranche losses increase substantially during the financial crisis.,"['Yong Seok Choi', 'Hitesh Doshi', 'Kris Jacobs', 'Stuart M.

Time series momentum: Is it there?,"Time series momentum (TSM) refers to the predictability of the past 12-month return on the next one-month return and is the focus of several recent influential studies. This paper shows that asset-by-asset time series regressions reveal little evidence of TSM, both in- and out-of-sample. While the t-statistic in a pooled regression appears large, it is not statistically reliable as it is less than the critical values of parametric and nonparametric bootstraps. From an investment perspective, the TSM strategy is profitable, but its performance is virtually the same as that of a similar strategy that is based on historical sample mean and does not require predictability. Overall, the evidence on TSM is weak, particularly for the large cross section of assets.","['Dashan Huang', 'Jiangyuan Li', 'Liyao Wang', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Time series momentum', 'Risk premium', 'Return predictability', 'Pooled regression']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301953,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
A comparison of some structural models of private information arrival,"We show that the PIN and the Duarte and Young (2009) (APIN) models do not match the variability of noise trade in the data and that this limitation has severe implications for how these models identify private information. We examine two alternatives to these models, the Generalized PIN model (GPIN) and the Odders-White and Ready (2008) model (OWR).

Portfolio rebalancing in general equilibrium,"This paper develops an overlapping generations model of optimal rebalancing where agents differ in age and risk tolerance. Equilibrium rebalancing is driven by a leverage effect that influences levered and unlevered agents in opposite directions, an aggregate risk tolerance effect that depends on the distribution of wealth, and an intertemporal hedging effect. After a negative macroeconomic shock, relatively risk-tolerant investors sell risky assets, while more risk-averse investors buy them. Owing to interactions of leverage and changing wealth, however, all agents have higher exposure to aggregate risk after a negative macroeconomic shock and lower exposure after a positive shock.","['Miles S.

Shrinking the cross-section,"We construct a robust stochastic discount factor (SDF) summarizing the joint explanatory power of a large number of cross-sectional stock return predictors. Our method achieves robust out-of-sample performance in this high-dimensional setting by imposing an economically motivated prior on SDF coefficients that shrinks contributions of low-variance principal components of the candidate characteristics-based factors. We find that characteristics-sparse SDFs formed from a few such factors‚Äîe.g., the four- or five-factor models in the recent literature‚Äîcannot adequately summarize the cross-section of expected stock returns. However, an SDF formed from a small number of principal components performs well.","['Serhiy Kozak', 'Stefan Nagel', 'Shrihari Santosh']","['Factor models','SDF','Cross section','Shrinkage','Machine learning']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301655,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Trading and arbitrage in cryptocurrency markets,"Cryptocurrency markets exhibit periods of large, recurrent arbitrage opportunities across exchanges. These price deviations are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of capital controls for the movement of arbitrage capital. Price deviations across countries co-move and open up in times of large bitcoin appreciation. Countries with higher bitcoin premia over the US bitcoin price see widening arbitrage deviations when bitcoin appreciates. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common and an idiosyncratic component. The common component explains 80% of bitcoin returns. The idiosyncratic components help explain arbitrage spreads between exchanges.","['Igor Makarov', 'Antoinette Schoar']","['Cryptocurrencies', 'Bitcoin', 'Arbitrage', 'Price impact', 'Capital controls']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301746,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Show me the money: The monetary policy risk premium,"We create a parsimonious monetary policy exposure (MPE) index based on observable firm characteristics that previous studies link to how stocks react to monetary policy. Our index successfully captures stocks‚Äô responses to both conventional and unconventional monetary policy. Stocks whose prices react more positively to expansionary monetary policy (high-MPE stocks) earn lower average returns. This result is consistent with the notion that high-MPE stocks provide a hedge against bad economic shocks, to which the Federal Reserve responds with expansionary monetary policy. A long-short trading strategy designed to exploit this effect achieves an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 0.77.","['Ali Ozdagli', 'Mihail Velikov']","['Monetary policy', 'Asset pricing', 'Risk factors']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301709,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Quantify the quantitative easing: Impact on bonds and corporate debt issuance,"This paper studies the impact of the European Central Bank‚Äôs (ECB) Corporate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP) announcement on prices, liquidity, and debt issuance in the European corporate bond market using a data set on bond transactions from Euroclear. I find that the quantitative easing (QE) programme increased prices and liquidity of bonds eligible to be purchased substantially. Bond yields dropped on average by 30 basis points (bps) (8%) after the CSPP announcement. Tri-party repo turnover rose by 8.15 million USD (29%), and bilateral turnover went up by 7.05 million USD (72%). Bid-ask spreads also showed significant liquidity improvement in eligible bonds. QE was successful in boosting corporate debt issuance. Firms issued 2.19 billion EUR (25%) more in QE-eligible debt after the CSPP announcement, compared to other types of debt. Surprisingly, corporates used the attracted funds mostly to increase dividends. These effects were more pronounced for longer-maturity, lower-rated bonds, and for more credit-constrained, lower-rated firms.",['Karamfil Todorov'],"['Quantitative easing', 'Corporate Sector Purchase Programme', 'ECB', 'Bond market', 'Corporate debt issuance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301941,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Trading out of sight: An analysis of cross-trading in mutual fund families,"This paper explores how mutual fund groups set the price of in-house transactions among affiliated funds. We collect a data set of four million equity transactions and compare the pricing of trades crossed internally (cross-trades) with that of twin trades executed with external counterparties. While cross-trades should reduce transaction costs for both trading parties, we find that the price of cross-trades is set strategically to reallocate performance among sibling funds. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a large number of cross-trades are backdated. We discuss the implications for the literature on fund performance and the current regulatory debate.","['Alexander Eisele', 'Tamara Nefedova', 'Gianpaolo Parise', 'Kim Peijnenburg']","['Mutual fund families', 'Cross-trades', 'Monitoring', 'Backdating', 'Transfer pricing']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301734,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
An ill wind? Terrorist attacks and CEO compensation,"Using multiple measures of attack proximity, we show that CEOs employed at firms located near terrorist attacks earn an average pay increase of 12% after the attack relative to CEOs at firms located far from attacks. CEOs at terrorist attack-proximate firms prefer cash-based compensation increases (e.g., salary and bonus) over equity-based compensation (e.g., options and stocks granted). The effect is causal and it is larger when the bargaining power of the CEO is high. Other executives and workers do not receive a terrorist attack premium.","['Yunhao Dai', 'P.

Measuring skewness premia,"We provide a new methodology to empirically investigate the respective roles of systematic and idiosyncratic skewness in explaining expected stock returns. Using a large number of predictors, we forecast the cross-sectional ranks of systematic and idiosyncratic skewness, which are easier to predict than their actual values. Compared to other measures of ex ante systematic skewness, our forecasts create a significant spread in ex post systematic skewness. A predicted systematic skewness risk factor carries a significant and robust risk premium that ranges from 6% to 12% per year. In contrast, the role of idiosyncratic skewness in pricing stocks is less robust.",['Hugues Langlois'],"['Systematic skewness', 'Coskewness', 'Idiosyncratic skewness', 'Large panel regression', 'Forecasting']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930159X,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Reputations and credit ratings: Evidence from commercial mortgage-backed securities,"How do changes in a rating agency's reputation affect the ratings market? We study the dynamics of credit ratings after Standard & Poor's (S&P) was shut out of a large segment of the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) ratings market following a procedural mistake. Exploiting the fact that most CMBS have ratings from multiple agencies, we show that S&P subsequently eased its standards compared to other raters. This coincided with a partial recovery in the number of deals S&P was hired to rate. Our findings suggest that an agency can regain market share after suffering reputational damage by issuing optimistic ratings.","['Ramin P.

Financing dies in darkness? The impact of newspaper closures on public finance,"We examine how local newspaper closures affect public finance outcomes for local governments. Following a newspaper closure, municipal borrowing costs increase by 5‚Äì11 basis points, costing the municipality an additional $650,000 per issue. This effect is causal and not driven by underlying economic conditions. The loss of government monitoring resulting from a closure is associated with higher government wages and deficits and increased likelihoods of costly advance refundings and negotiated sales. Overall, our results indicate that local newspapers hold their governments accountable, keeping municipal borrowing costs low and ultimately saving local taxpayers money.","['Pengjie Gao', 'Chang Lee', 'Dermot Murphy']","['Media', 'Monitoring', 'Public finance', 'Municipal bonds']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301606,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
An inconvenient cost: The effects of climate change on municipal bonds,"Counties more likely to be affected by climate change pay more in underwriting fees and initial yields to issue long-term municipal bonds compared to counties unlikely to be affected by climate change. This difference disappears when comparing short-term municipal bonds, implying the market prices climate change risks for long-term securities only. Higher issuance costs for climate risk counties are driven by bonds with lower credit ratings. Investor attention is a driving factor, as the difference in issuance costs on bonds issued by climate and nonclimate affected counties increases after the release of the 2006 Stern Review on climate change.",['Marcus Painter'],"['Climate change', 'Municipal bonds', 'Sea level rise', 'Investor attention']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301631,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Institutional shareholders and corporate social responsibility,"This study uses two distinct quasi-natural experiments to examine the effect of institutional shareholders on corporate social responsibility (CSR). We first find that an exogenous increase in institutional holding caused by Russell Index reconstitutions improves portfolio firms‚Äô CSR performance. We then find that firms have lower CSR ratings when shareholders are distracted due to exogenous shocks. Moreover, the effect of institutional ownership is stronger in CSR categories that are financially material. Furthermore, we show that institutional shareholders influence CSR through CSR-related proposals. Overall, our results suggest that institutional shareholders can generate real social impact.","['Tao Chen', 'Hui Dong', 'Chen Lin']","['Institutional ownership', 'Indexing', 'Shareholder attention', 'Corporate social responsibility', 'Random discontinuity']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301643,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Inventor CEOs,"One in five U.S. high-technology firms are led by CEOs with hands-on innovation experience as inventors. Firms led by ‚ÄúInventor CEOs‚Äù are associated with higher quality innovation, especially when the CEO is a high-impact inventor. During an Inventor CEO's tenure, firms file a greater number of patents and more valuable patents in technology classes where the CEO's hands-on experience lies. Utilizing plausibly exogenous CEO turnovers to address the matching of CEOs to firms suggests these effects are causal. The results can be explained by an Inventor CEO's superior ability to evaluate, select, and execute innovative investment projects related to their own hands-on experience.","['Emdad Islam', 'Jason Zein']","['Inventor CEOs', 'CEO style', 'Innovation', 'Human capital']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301667,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Is information risk priced? Evidence from abnormal idiosyncratic volatility,"We propose a new, price-based measure of information risk called abnormal idiosyncratic volatility (AIV) that captures information asymmetry faced by uninformed investors. AIV is the idiosyncratic volatility prior to information events in excess of normal levels. Using earnings announcements as information events, we show that AIV is positively associated with informed return run-ups, abnormal insider trading, short selling, and institutional trading during pre-earnings-announcement periods. We find that stocks with high AIV earn economically and statistically larger future returns than stocks with low AIV. Taken together, our findings support the notion that information risk is priced.","['Yung Chiang Yang', 'Bohui Zhang', 'Chu Zhang']","['Information risk', 'Idiosyncratic volatility', 'Earnings announcement', 'Expected returns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301710,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Dynamic interventions and informational linkages,"We model a dynamic economy with strategic complementarity among investors and study how endogenous government interventions mitigate coordination failures. We establish equilibrium existence and uniqueness, and we show that one intervention can affect another through altering the public information structure. A stronger initial intervention helps subsequent interventions through increasing the likelihood of positive news, but also leads to negative conditional updates. Our results suggest optimal policy should emphasize initial interventions when coordination outcomes tend to correlate. Neglecting informational externalities of initial interventions results in over- or under-interventions. Moreover, saving smaller funds disproportionally more can generate greater informational benefits at smaller costs.","['Lin William Cong', 'Steven R.

Providing liquidity in an illiquid market: Dealer behavior in US corporate bonds,"We examine market making behavior of dealers for 55,988 corporate bonds, many of which trade infrequently. Dealers have a substantially higher propensity to offset trades within the same day rather than committing capital for longer periods for riskier and less actively traded bonds. Dealers‚Äô holding periods do not decline with a bond's prior trading activity and in fact are lowest for some of the least active bonds. As a result, cross-sectional estimates of roundtrip trading costs do not increase as prior trading activity declines. Our results suggest that dealers endogenously adjust their behavior to mitigate inventory risk from trading in illiquid and higher risk securities, balancing search and inventory costs in equilibrium such that observed spreads can appear invariant to expected liquidity.","['Michael A.

The job rating game: Revolving doors and analyst incentives,"Investment banks frequently hire analysts from rating agencies. While many argue that this ‚Äúrevolving door‚Äù creates captured analysts, it can also create incentives to improve accuracy. To study this issue, I construct an original data set, linking analysts to their career paths and the securitized finance ratings they issue. First, I show that accurate analysts are more frequently hired by underwriting investment banks. Second, I exploit two distinct sources of variation in the likelihood of being hired by a bank. Both indicate that, as this likelihood rises, analyst accuracy improves.

Potential pilot problems: Treatment spillovers in financial regulatory experiments,"The total effects of a regulatory change consist of direct effects and indirect effects (spillovers), but the standard difference-in-difference approach mostly ignores potential indirect effects. During the 2007 full repeal of the uptick rule, short-sellers become much more aggressive across the board, even in control stocks where the uptick rule is already suspended. This finding is consistent with positive and significant indirect effects on control stocks, likely driven by aggressive broad list-based shorting. In contract, the indirect effect coefficients on shorting aggressiveness are negative for the 2005 partial uptick repeal, possibly due to substitutions between control and treatment stocks.","['Ekkehart Boehmer', 'Charles M.

Idea sharing and the performance of mutual funds,"I develop an equilibrium model to explain why few mutual fund managers consistently outperform, even though many have strong informational advantages. The key ingredient is that managers obtain investment ideas through idea sharing. Idea sharing improves statistical significance of alpha through increased price informativeness. But it also causes better informed managers to take larger positions, which makes their alpha noisier‚Äîalthough a significant fraction of managers builds strong informational advantages, statistical significance and persistence of alpha concentrate in underperforming funds.

Squaring venture capital valuations with reality,"We develop a valuation model for venture capital‚Äìbacked companies and apply it to 135 US unicorns, that is, private companies with reported valuations above $1 billion. We value unicorns using financial terms from legal filings and find that reported unicorn post-money valuations average 48% above fair value, with 14 being more than 100% above. Reported valuations assume that all shares are as valuable as the most recently issued preferred shares. We calculate values for each share class, which yields lower valuations because most unicorns gave recent investors major protections such as initial public offering (IPO) return guarantees (15%), vetoes over down-IPOs (24%), or seniority to all other investors (30%). Common shares lack all such protections and are 56% overvalued. After adjusting for these valuation-inflating terms, almost one-half (65 out of 135) of unicorns lose their unicorn status.","['Will Gornall', 'Ilya A.

Exchanges of innovation resources inside venture capital portfolios,"I explore the prevalence of exchanges of innovation resources inside venture capital portfolios. I show that after companies join investors‚Äô portfolios, several proxies of exchanges between them and portfolio companies (relative to matched nonportfolio companies) increase by an average of 60%. The increase holds when joining events are plausibly exogenous and when VCs‚Äô bargaining power and potential conflicts of interest are low.

In selecting investments, VCs see the management team as somewhat more important than business-related characteristics such as product or technology although there is meaningful cross-sectional variation across company stage and industry. VCs also attribute the ultimate investment success or failure more to the team than to the business. While deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment value-added all contribute to value creation, the VCs rate deal selection as the most important of the three.

"Shorting flows, public disclosure, and market efficiency","Shorting flows remain a significant predictor of negative future stock returns during 2010‚Äì2015, when daily short-sale volume data are published in real time.

Indeed, abnormal short-term shorting flows do not predict future returns or anticipate bad news. We find that short sellers exploit prominent anomalies. A comparison with the Regulation SHO data indicates that the predictability is much shorter-term during 2005‚Äì2007. Short sellers appear to have shifted from trading on short-term private information to trading on long-term public information that is gradually incorporated into prices.","['Xue Wang', 'Xuemin\xa0(Sterling) Yan', 'Lingling Zheng']","['Short sale', 'Public disclosure', 'Return predictability', 'Anomalies']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301436,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1

We find, based on more than two million anomaly country-months, that the United States is the only country with a reliable post-publication decline in long-short returns. Collectively, our meta-analysis of return predictors suggests that barriers to arbitrage trading can create segmented markets and that anomalies tend to represent mispricing instead of data mining.","['Heiko Jacobs', 'Sebastian M√ºller']","['Return predictability', 'International stock markets', 'Arbitrage', 'Publication impact', 'Anomalies']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301618,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1
"Earnings, retained earnings, and book-to-market in the cross section of expected returns","Book value of equity consists of two economically different components: retained earnings and contributed capital. We predict that book-to-market strategies work because the retained earnings component of the book value of equity includes the accumulation and, hence, the averaging of past earnings. Retained earnings-to-market predicts the cross section of average returns in U.S.¬†and international data and subsumes book-to-market. Contributed capital-to-market has no predictive power. We show that retained earnings-to-market, and, by extension, book-to-market, predicts returns because it is a good proxy for underlying earnings yield (Ball, 1978; Berk, 1995) and not because book value represents intrinsic value.","['Ray Ball', 'Joseph Gerakos', 'Juhani T.

Time to build and the real-options channel of residential investment,"A standard real-options model predicts that time-to-build investment could be delayed by uncertainty over future revenue. We quantify the first-order importance of this mechanism in the 2002‚Äì2011 housing boom-bust cycle by developing and estimating a model of sequential irreversible investment with stochastic bottlenecks. We find that the main driver of construction delays during the boom is construction bottlenecks. However, further delay in construction during the bust is caused by an increase in uncertainty, which grew by 21.6% between 2002 and 2009. The model can account for more than one-third of the decline in residential investment between 2002 and 2009.","['Hyunseung Oh', 'Chamna Yoon']","['Investment', 'Housing', 'Real options']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301722,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1
Does size matter? Bailouts with large and small banks,"We explore how large and small banks make funding decisions when system-wide bailouts are possible. We show that bank size, purely on strategic grounds, is a key determinant of banksí leverage choices, even when bailout policies treat large and small banks symmetrically. Large banks leverage more than small banks because they internalize that their decisions directly affect bailout policies. In equilibrium, this effect is amplified by strategic spillovers to small banks since banksí leverage choices are strategic complements. Overall, the presence of large banks makes bailouts more likely. The optimal regulation features size-dependent policies that disproportionately restrict large banksí leverage.","['Eduardo D·vila', 'Ansgar Walther']","['Bailouts','Bank regulation','Too big to fail','Too many to fail','Size tax']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302247,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,1
Is the active fund management industry concentrated enough?,"We introduce a theoretical model of the active fund management industry (AFMI) in which performance and size depend on the AFMI's competitiveness (concentration). Under plausible assumptions, as AFMI's concentration decreases, so do fund managersí incentives for exerting effort in search of alpha. Consequently, managers produce lower gross alpha, and rational investors, inferring lower expected AFMI performance, allocate a smaller portion of their wealth to active funds. Empirically, we find that a decrease in the US mutual fund industry concentration over our sample period is associated with a decrease in its net alpha and size (relative to stock market capitalization).","['David Feldman', 'Konark Saxena', 'Jingrui Xu']","['Active fund management','Market concentration','Effort','Industry size','Alpha']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302132,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,1
Adverse selection and the performance of private equity co-investments,"Investors increasingly look for private equity managers to provide opportunities for co-investing outside the fund structure, thereby saving fees and carried interest payments. In this paper, we use a large sample of buyout and venture capital co-investments to test how such deals compare with the remaining fund investments. In contrast to Fang, Ivashina, and Lerner (2015), we find no evidence of adverse selection. Gross return distributions of co-investments and other deals are similar. Co-investments generally have lower costs to investors.

We use this predictability to construct a diversified cross-asset time series momentum portfolio that yields a Sharpe ratio 45% higher than a standard time series momentum portfolio. We present evidence that time series momentum and cross-asset time series momentum are driven by slow-moving capital in bond and equity markets.","['Aleksi Pitk‰j‰rvi', 'Matti Suominen', 'Lauri Vaittinen']","['Asset pricing','Time series momentum','Cross-asset predictability','Slow-moving capital','International financial markets']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302156,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,1
OTC premia,"Using unique data at transaction and identity levels, we provide the first systematic study of interest rate swaps traded over the counter (OTC). We find substantial and persistent heterogeneity in derivative prices consistent with a pass-through of regulatory costs on to market prices via so-called valuation adjustments (XVA). A client pays a higher price to buy interest rate protection from a dealer (i.e., the client pays a higher fixed rate) if the contract is not cleared via a central counterparty. This OTC premium decreases by posting initial margins and with higher buyerís creditworthiness.

The law decreased affected firmsí likelihood of becoming the target of a merger or acquisition and had a negative impact on shareholder value. There is no evidence that management of those firms subsequently altered firm policies in its interest. Investment, employment, wages, profitability, and capital structure remain unchanged.

Families with competitive incentives generate higher performing funds, a higher fraction of ìstarî funds, but greater performance dispersion across funds. In examining the determinants of incentive schemes, competitive families are more likely to manage institutional money, and cooperative families are more likely to distribute through brokers, consistent with retail demand for nonperformance characteristics.","['Richard Burtis Evans', 'Melissa Porras Prado', 'Rafael Zambrana']","['Mutual fund','Manager','Compensation','Incentives','Competition','Cooperation','Cross-holding','Performance','Cross-subsidization','Internal capital markets']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302235,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,1

At the same time, these banks reduce commercial lending and firms that borrow from these banks decrease investment. The effect of Treasury purchases is different: either positive or insignificant in most cases.

A similar return pattern holds for all maturity and moneyness categories and equity options. These positive intraday returns are particularly difficult to explain. However, our results are consistent with option pricesí failing to account for the well-known fact that stock volatility is substantially higher intraday than overnight.

The term structure of liquidity provision,"We examine realized spreads and price impact in clock and trade time following each trade in all common stocks from 2010 to 2017.

The majority of the price impact of trades in large (small)-capitalization stocks takes place within 15 (60) seconds. Net profits to liquidity provision, or equivalently, net costs to liquidity demanders, decline over the sample period even at the shortest horizons that we consider: at the 100 ms horizon, aggregate profits decline from 1.9 basis points of total dollar volume in 2010 to 1.0 basis points in 2017.","['Jennifer Conrad', 'Sunil Wahal']","['Liquidity','Market microstructure','Trading','High frequency trading']",[],April,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302272,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,1
Stress tests and small business lending,"Post-crisis stress tests have altered banksí credit supply to small business. Banks most affected by stress tests reallocate credit away from riskier markets and toward safer ones. They also raise interest rates on small loans. Quantities fall most in high-risk markets where stress-tested banks own no branches, and prices rise mainly where they do. The results suggest that banks price the stress-test induced increase in capital requirements where they have local knowledge, and exit where they do not. Stress tests do not, however, reduce aggregate credit. Small banks seem to increase their share in geographies formerly reliant on stress-tested lenders.","['Kristle R.

Does the stock market make firms more productive?,"Management, directly or indirectly, learns from its firm's stock price, so a more informative stock price should make the firm more productive. We show that stock price informativeness increases firm productivity. We provide direct evidence of one channel through which stock price informativeness affects productivity; specifically, we find that CEO turnover is less sensitive to Tobin's q when informativeness is lower. We predict and confirm that the productivity of smaller and younger firms, better governed firms, more specialized firms, and firms with more competition is more strongly related to the informativeness of their stock price. We further address endogeneity concerns with the use of brokerage closures, S&P 500 additions, and mutual fund redemptions as plausibly exogenous events.","['Benjamin Bennett', 'RenÈ Stulz', 'Zexi Wang']","['Stock price informativeness','TFP','Firm efficiency']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302259,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,2

Shareholder protection strongly predicted exchange success, even in countries with high levels of venture capital activity, patenting, and financial market development. Better shareholder protection allowed younger, less-profitable, but faster-growing, companies to raise more capital.

Householdsí preferences for liquid assets imply a liquidity premium on deposits. The banking sector supplies deposits and has excessive risk-taking incentives. I show that the scarcity of deposits created by an increased capital requirement can reduce the cost of capital for banks and increase bank lending. A higher capital requirement also increases banksí monitoring incentives, which improves the efficiency of banksí activities. Under reasonable parameterizations, the marginal benefit of a higher capital requirement related to this channel significantly exceeds the marginal cost, indicating that US capital requirements have been suboptimally low.",['Juliane Begenau'],"['Capital requirement','Bank regulation','Bank loan supply','Safe asset demand']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302508,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,2

The trading speed is higher in more persistent, riskier, and higher-liquidity states. It can be optimal to overweight low Sharpe-ratio assets such as Treasury bonds because they remain liquid even in crisis states.

Mutual fund investments in private firms,"Historically, a key advantage of being a public firm was broader access to capital, from a disperse group of shareholders. In recent years, such capital has increasingly become available to private firms as well. We document a dramatic increase over the past twenty years in the number of mutual funds participating in private markets and in the dollar value of these private firm investments. We evaluate several factors that potentially contribute to this trend: firms seeking extra capital to postpone public listing, mutual funds seeking higher risk-adjusted returns and initial public offering (IPO) allocations, and venture capitalists (VCs) seeking new investors to substantiate higher valuations. Results indicate that the first two factors play a significant role.","['Sungjoung Kwon', 'Michelle Lowry', 'Yiming Qian']","['Private firm','Mutual fund','IPO']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302491,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,2
Time-varying inflation risk and stock returns,"We show that inflation risk is priced in stock returns and that inflation risk premia in the cross-section and the aggregate market vary over time, even changing sign as in the early 2000s. This time variation is due to both price and quantities of inflation risk changing over time. Using a consumption-based asset pricing model, we argue that inflation risk is priced because inflation predicts real consumption growth. The historical changes in this predictability and in stocksí inflation betas can account for the size, variability, predictability, and sign reversals in inflation risk premia.","['Martijn Boons', 'Fernando Duarte', 'Frans de Roon', 'Marta Szymanowska']","['Inflation','Time-varying inflation risk premium','Inflation hedging','Individual stock returns','Cross-sectional asset-pricing','Nominal-real covariance']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302429,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,2

This risk premium is intimately tied to sovereign risk, suggesting that guaranteed banks, defined as those of particular importance to the national economy, inherit the risk of the guarantor. Indeed, this premium does not exist in safe-haven countries. We rationalize these findings with a model in which implicit government guarantees are risky in the sense that they provide protection that depends on the aggregate state of the economy.","['Taneli M‰kinen', 'Lucio Sarno', 'Gabriele Zinna']","['Banks','Sovereign risk','Risk premium','Government guarantee']",[],May,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X1930251X,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,2

We instrument for Medicaid access using variation in state eligibility rules. We find substanital heterogeneity across households in the savings response to Medicaid. Households that are not experiencing financial hardship behave in a manner consistent with a precautionary savings model, meaning they save less under Medicaid. In contrast, among households experiencing financial hardship, Medicaid eligibility increases refund savings rates by roughly 5 percentage points or $102. For both sets of households, effects are stronger in states with lower bankruptcy exemption limitsóconsistent with uninsured, financially constrained households using bankruptcy to manage health expenditure risk.

Reversals to autocracy hike spreads more strongly. Our findings are robust to the comprehensive inclusion of relevant controls, to the instrumentation with regional waves of democratization, and to a battery of other sensitivity tests.

Recent evidence on experience effects suggests a long-lasting influence of personally experienced outcomes on investor beliefs and investment but also significant differences across older and younger generations. We formalize experience-based learning in an overlapping generations (OLG) model, where different cross-cohort experiences generate persistent heterogeneity in beliefs, portfolio choices, and trade. The model allows us to characterize a novel link between investor demographics and the dependence of prices on past dividends while also generating known features of asset prices, such as excess volatility and return predictability.

Blockholder voting,"Blockholders play a large role in corporate governance. We examine their voting behavior by adding a voter with many votes, i.e., a blockholder, to a standard voting model. A blockholder may not vote with all of her shares. This is efficient because it prevents her from drowning out the information in othersí votes. This effect holds even when shares may be traded. Consequently, regulations prohibiting abstention will harm information aggregation, though such regulations may promote information acquisition by blockholders.

The paper analytically shows how firm characteristics shape the optimal contract and the horizon of corporate policies, thereby generating a number of novel empirical predictions on the optimality of short- versus long-termism. It also demonstrates that combining short- and long-term agency conflicts naturally leads to asymmetric pay-for-performance in managerial contracts.","['Sebastian Gryglewicz', 'Simon Mayer', 'Erwan Morellec']","['Optimal short- and long-termism','Agency conflicts','Multitasking']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302909,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,3
The redistributive effects of bank capital regulation,"We present a general equilibrium model of banksí optimal capital structure where bankruptcy is costly and investors have heterogeneous endowments and incur a cost for participating in equity markets. We show that, besides its social benefits, capital regulation benefits bank shareholders when it resolves fire sales externalities but not when it acts as a tax on bank profits such as when used to control excessive leverage induced by deposit insurance. Furthermore, capital regulation widens the gap between the returns to bank shareholders and depositors and may reduce investments in projects in favor of storage.","['Elena Carletti', 'Robert Marquez', 'Silvio Petriconi']","['Limited market participation','Bank capital structure','Capital regulation','Investor returns']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302892,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,3
Information flows among rivals and corporate investment,"Using a novel pairwise measure of firmsí acquisition of rivalsí disclosures, we show that investment opportunities drive interfirm information flows. We find that these flows predict subsequent mergers and acquisitions as well as how and how much firms invest, relative to rivals. Moreover, firmsí use of rivalsí information often hinges on the similarities of their products. Our results suggest that rivalsí public information, far from being unusable, helps facilitate investment and product decisions, including acquisitions and product differentiation strategies.

The measure is informative about liquidity in other asset classes, including corporate bonds and equities. A decline in liquidity supply predicts reduced debt issuance and investment by nonfinancial firms and reduced aggregate economic activity.

Private money creation with safe assets and term premia,"The existing literature has shown that an increase in the demand for safe assets induces the private sector to create more of them. Focusing on repos backed by US Treasuries, I theoretically and empirically show that an increase in the demand for safe assets leads to a decrease in repos outstanding. Because Treasuries are safe assets, an increase in the demand for safe assets compresses their term premia, reducing incentives to issue repos. Thus, the sensitivity of private safe asset creation depends on whether the collateral backing them are safe assets themselves. The sensitivity of the Federal Reserveís reverse repurchase agreement (RRP) operations has the same sign as existing studies.",['Sebastian Infante'],"['Safe assets','Private money','Repo','Monetary policy','Federal Reserve']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19302867,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,3
Managerial control benefits and takeover market efficiency,"How and to what extent do managerial control benefits shape the efficiency of the takeover market? We revisit this question by estimating both the dark and bright sides of managerial control benefits in an industry equilibrium model. On the dark side, managersí private benefits of control distort firmsí takeover incentives and hinder the reallocation role of the takeover market. On the bright side, fear of a takeover induces underperforming managers to exert more effort and enhances the disciplinary role of the takeover market. Our estimates suggest that the bright-side effect increases the value created by an active takeover market by 21%, comparable in magnitude to the dark-side effect. It is also important to account for this bright-side effect in explaining certain features of the takeover market, including a low takeover-performance sensitivity.","['Wenyu Wang', 'Yufeng Wu']","['Mergers and acquisitions','Private benefits of control','Structural estimation']",[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X1930282X,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,136,3

Dancing with activists,"An important milestone often reached in the life of an activist engagement is entering into a ìsettlementî agreement between the activist and the target's board. Using a comprehensive hand-collected data set, we analyze the drivers, nature, and consequences of such settlement agreements. Settlements are more likely when the activist has a credible threat to win board seats in a proxy fight and when incumbentsí reputation concerns are stronger. Consistent with incomplete contracting, face-saving benefits, and private information considerations, settlements commonly do not contract directly on operational or leadership changes sought by the activist but rather on board composition changes. Settlements are accompanied by positive stock price reactions, and they are subsequently followed by changes of the type sought by activists, including CEO turnover, higher shareholder payouts, and improved operating performance. We find no evidence to support concerns that settlements enable activists to extract rents at the expense of other investors. Our analysis provides a look into the ìblack boxî of activist engagements and contributes to understanding how activism brings about changes in target companies.","['Lucian A.

The financing of local government in China: Stimulus loan wanes and shadow banking waxes,"The upsurge of shadow banking is typically driven by rising financing demand from certain real sectors. In China, the 4 trillion yuan stimulus package in 2009 was behind the rapid growth of shadow banking after 2012, expediting the development of Chinese corporate bond markets in the poststimulus period. Chinese local governments financed the stimulus through bank loans in 2009 and then resorted to nonbank debt financing after 2012 when faced with rollover pressure from bank debt coming due. Cross-sectionally, using a political-economy-based instrument, we show that provinces with greater bank loan growth in 2009 experienced more municipal corporate bond issuance during 2012ñ2015, together with more shadow banking activities including trustloans and wealth management products. Chinaís poststimulus experience exhibits similarities to financial market development during the US National Banking Era.","['Zhuo Chen', 'Zhiguo He', 'Chun Liu']","['Local government financing vehicles','Municipal corporate bonds','Political cycle','Shadow banking in China','Railroad finance','Trust companies']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300179,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,137,1

"Off-balance sheet funding, voluntary support and investment efficiency","Off-balance sheet financing of an investment is covered by limited liability, whereas on-balance sheet financing creates unlimited liability towards the bankís asset-in-place. Off-balance sheet funding thus gives the bank flexibility to voluntarily support debt repayments when the investment fails, which allows the bank to signal information about the quality of its future projects, improving investment efficiency. Yet, limited liability reduces the bankís effort incentives. Off-balance sheet funding with voluntary support is optimal for activities that are rapidly growing or negatively correlated with existing assets.

Pre-trade hedging: Evidence from the issuance of retail structured products,"We find evidence consistent with previously unrecognized market manipulation by broker-dealers. Specifically, we show that pre-trade hedging, which is distinct from front-running, alters prices at which derivative trades occur. We show this behavior is intentional by exploiting variation in the design of structured equity products (SEPs). We find positive abnormal returns on SEP pricing dates for which issuers benefit from altering closing stock prices but no such returns on pricing dates of otherwise similar SEPs. We also show that large buy trades near the close of trading are more frequent when SEP issuers have incentives to alter closing stock prices.","['Brian J. Henderson', 'Neil D.

Conditional on the occurrence of default, the true and risk-adjusted one-week probabilities of devaluation are 42% (2%) and 90% (55%) for the core (periphery) countries.

Who's paying attention? Measuring common ownership and its impact on managerial incentives,"We derive a measure that captures the extent to which common ownership shifts managersí incentives to internalize externalities. A key feature of the measure is that it allows for the possibility that not all investors are attentive to whether a manager's actions benefit the investor's overall portfolio. Empirically, we show that potential drivers of common ownership, including mergers in the asset management industry and, under certain circumstances, even indexing, could diminish managerial motives to internalize externalities. Our findings illustrate the importance of accounting for investor inattention when analyzing whether the growth of common ownership affects managerial incentives.","['Erik P. Gilje', 'Todd A.

Short-term debt and incentives for risk-taking,"We challenge the view that short-term debt curbs moral hazard and demonstrate that, in a world with financing frictions and fair debt pricing, short-term debt generates incentives for risk-taking. To do so, we develop a model in which firms are financed with equity and short-term debt and cannot freely optimize their default decision because of financing frictions. We show that when firms are close to distress, the dynamic interaction of operating and rollover losses fuels default risk. In such instances, shareholders find it optimal to increase asset risk to improve interim debt repricing and prevent inefficient liquidation. These risk-taking incentives do not arise when debt maturity is sufficiently long.","['Marco Della Seta', 'Erwan Morellec', 'Francesca Zucchi']","['Short-term debt financing','Rollover risk','Risk-taking','Financing frictions']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300155,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,137,1

Analysts whose recommendations are better aligned with anomaly signals are more skilled and elicit stronger recommendation announcement returns.

The persistent effect of initial success: Evidence from venture capital,"We use investment-level data to study performance persistence in venture capital (VC). Consistent with prior studies, we find that each additional initial public offering (IPO) among a VC firmís first ten investments predicts as much as an 8% higher IPO rate on its subsequent investments, though this effect erodes with time. In exploring its sources, we document several additional facts: successful outcomes stem in large part from investing in the right places at the right times; VC firms do not persist in their ability to choose the right places and times to invest; but early success does lead to investing in later rounds and in larger syndicates. This pattern of results seems most consistent with the idea that initial success improves access to deal flow. That preferential access raises the quality of subsequent investments, perpetuating performance differences in initial investments.","['Ramana Nanda', 'Sampsa Samila', 'Olav Sorenson']","['Venture capital','Performance','Monitoring','Selection','Status']",[],July,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300337,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,137,1

Despite the rise in term loans without financial covenantsóso-called covenant-lite loansóborrowing firmsí revolving lines of credit almost always retain traditional financial covenants. This split structure gives revolving lenders the exclusive right and ability to monitor and to renegotiate the financial covenants, and we confirm that loans with split control rights are still subject to the discipline of financial covenants. We provide evidence that split control rights are designed to mitigate bargaining frictions that have arisen with the entry of nonbank lenders and became apparent during the financial crisis.","['Mitchell Berlin', 'Greg Nini', 'Edison G.

We then demonstrate that using credit spreads rather than historical default rates to identify the default boundary provides the statistical power necessary to reject their assumption that firm dynamics follow geometric Brownian motion. A large market price of jump risk is required to match historical default rates, which generates a credit spread puzzle for investment-grade but not high-yield bonds.","['Jennie Bai', 'Robert S.

Consistent with model predictions, ECB purchases drive specialness of targeted securities in combination with short-selling.

Heterogeneous beliefs and return volatility around seasoned equity offerings,"We investigate the dynamics of heterogeneous beliefs and link them to the volatility pattern throughout the seasoned equity offering (SEO) event window. In sync with a reduction in information asymmetry related to management information releases around the SEO event, belief heterogeneity declines. Moreover, heterogeneity in beliefs, proxied by either analyst- or institutional-trade-based measures, is a robust and salient determinant of SEO firm volatility, which provides an explanation for the volatility timing ìpuzzleî identified in the SEO market. Furthermore, the relation between heterogeneous beliefs and return volatility weakens as short sale constraints tighten, suggesting a potential causal link.","['Ann Marie Hibbert', 'Qiang Kang', 'Alok Kumar', 'Suchi Mishra']","['Return volatility','SEOs','Analyst forecast dispersion','Trade-based heterogeneity in beliefs','Short selling']",[],August,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300623,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,137,2
The paradox of pledgeability,"We develop a model in which collateral serves to protect creditors from the claims of other creditors. We find that, paradoxically, borrowers rely most on collateral when pledgeability is high. This is when taking on new debt is easy, which dilutes existing creditors. Creditors thus require collateral for protection against possible dilution by collateralized debt. There is a collateral rat race. But collateralized borrowing has a cost: it encumbers assets, constraining future borrowing and investment. There is a collateral overhang. Our results suggest that policies aimed at increasing the supply of collateral can backfire, triggering an inefficient collateral rat race. Likewise, upholding the absolute priority of secured debt can exacerbate the rat race.","['Jason Roderick Donaldson', 'Denis Gromb', 'Giorgia Piacentino']","['Collateral','Secured debt','Absolute priority rule','Pledgeability']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19301199,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,137,3

CEO-board dynamics,"We examine CEO-board dynamics using a new panel dataset that spans 1920 to 2011. The long sample allows us to perform within-firm and within-CEO tests over a long horizon, many for the first time in the governance literature. Consistent with theories of bargaining or dynamic contracting, we find board independence increases at CEO turnover and falls with CEO tenure, with the decline stronger following superior performance. CEOs are also more likely to be appointed board chair as tenure increases, and we find evidence consistent with a substitution between board independence and chair duality. Other results suggest that these classes of models fail to capture important elements of board dynamics. First, the magnitude of the CEO tenure effect is economically small, much smaller, for example, than the strong persistence in board structure that we show. Second, when external CEOs are hired, board independence falls and subsequently increases. Third, event studies show a positive market reaction when powerful CEOs die in office, consistent with powerful CEOs becoming entrenched.","['John R.

The US Treasury floating rate note puzzle: Is there a premium for mark-to-market stability?,"We find that Treasury floating rate notes (FRNs) trade at a significant premium relative to the prices of Treasury bills and notes. This premium is directly related to the near-constant nature of FRN prices and is correlated with measures reflecting investor demand for safe assets. Money market funds are often the primary investors in FRNs, and the FRN premium is related to flows into funds with fixed net asset values, but not to flows into funds with variable net asset values. These results provide strong evidence that the FRN premium represents a convenience yield for the mark-to-market stability feature of FRNs.","['Matthias Fleckenstein', 'Francis A.

CEOsí outside opportunities and relative performance evaluation: evidence from a natural experiment,This paper examines the effect of CEOsí outside opportunities on the use of relative performance evaluation (RPE) in CEO compensation. My tests exploit the staggered rejection of the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine (IDD) by US state courts as an exogenous increase in CEOsí outside opportunities. I find that the rejection of the IDD leads to a significant increase in the sensitivity of CEO pay to systematic performance (less RPE). This increase is more pronounced for CEOs with greater labor market mobility and industries where proprietary information is more important and not related to measures of governance quality. These results suggest that firms link CEO pay to systematic performance to retain talent and ensure participation.,[],"['Relative performance evaluation','CEO compensation','CEO labor market']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300775,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,137,3
Emergency loans and collateral upgrades: How broker-dealers used Federal Reserve credit during the 2008 financial crisis,"During the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve established two emergency facilities for broker-dealers: one provided collateralized loans; the other, collateral upgrades. These facilities alleviated dealersí funding pressures when access to repos backed by illiquid collateral deteriorated. The ability to upgrade collateral allowed dealers to continue funding their own illiquid inventories (avoiding potential firesales) and to provide better bond market liquidity. It also helped sustain dealersí credit to hedge fund clients, which in turn posted relatively better returns.",[],"['Financial crisis','Lender of last resort','Repo','Collateral','Dealers']",[],September,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20300647,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,137,3

We find that such recovered physical distributions based on the S&P 500 index are incompatible with future returns and fail to predict future returns and realized variances.

On average, a typical customer contacts few dealers when seeking liquidity. A theoretical model shows that the benefit of competition through wider order exposure is mitigated by a winnerís curse problem and dealer-customer relationships.

Empirically, government spending level and uncertainty predict bond excess returns, as well as term structure level and slope movements. Shocks to government spending level and uncertainty are also priced in the cross-section of bond and stock portfolios. Theoretically, government spending level shocks raise inflation when marginal utility is high, thus generating positive inflation risk premia (term structure level effect). Uncertainty shocks steepen the yield curve (slope effect), producing positive term premia. These effects are consistent with evidence from a structural vector autoregression.

On the performance of volatility-managed portfolios,"Using a comprehensive set of 103 equity strategies, we analyze the value of volatility-managed portfolios for real-time investors. Volatility-managed portfolios do not systematically outperform their corresponding unmanaged portfolios in direct comparisons. Consistent with Moreira and Muir (2017), volatility-managed portfolios tend to exhibit significantly positive alphas in spanning regressions. However, the trading strategies implied by these regressions are not implementable in real time, and reasonable out-of-sample versions generally earn lower certainty equivalent returns and Sharpe ratios than do simple investments in the original, unmanaged portfolios. This poor out-of-sample performance for volatility-managed portfolios stems primarily from structural instability in the underlying spanning regressions.","['Scott Cederburg', ""Michael S.

IQ from IP: Simplifying search in portfolio choice,"Using a novel database that tracks web traffic on the Security Exchange Commission's EDGAR server between 2004 and 2015, we show that institutional investors gather information on a very particular subset of firms and insiders, and their surveillance is very persistent over time. This tracking behavior has powerful implications for their portfolio choice and its information content. An institution that downloaded an insider trading filing by a given firm last quarter increases its likelihood of downloading an insider trading filing on the same firm by more than 41.3 percentage points this quarter. Moreover, the average tracked stock that an institution buys generates annualized alphas of over 12% relative to the purchase of an average non tracked stock. We find that institutional managers tend to track top executives and to share educational and locational commonalities with the specific insiders they choose to follow. Collectively, our results suggest that the information in tracked trades is important for fundamental firm value and is only revealed following the information-rich dual trading by insiders and linked institutions.","['Huaizhi Chen', 'Lauren Cohen', 'Umit Gurun', 'Dong Lou', 'Christopher Malloy']","['Tracked trades','Return predictability','Institutional trading','Insider trading']",[],October,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301318,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,1

Greater analyst coverage crowds out (crowds in) corporate voluntary disclosure when analysts mostly discover information that is available (unavailable) to the firm.

Returns and liquidity of illiquid ETFs are more sensitive to underlying index returns or ETF market liquidity, or both. Thus, a positive liquidity premium exists in US ETF markets. The ETF variance could be larger than its net asst value variance owing to infrequent trading.

Central bank liquidity does not translate into lower loan spreads for high-risk banks for maturities beyond one year, even as it lowers deposit spreads for both high- and low-risk banks. This adversely affects the balance sheets of high-risk bank borrowers, leading to lower payouts, lower capital expenditures, and lower employment.

Activism and empire building,"Hedge fund activists target firms engaging in empire building and improve their future acquisition and divestiture strategy. Following intervention, activist targets make fewer acquisitions but obtain substantially higher returns by avoiding large and diversifying deals and refraining from acquisitions during merger waves. Activist targets also increase the pace of divestitures and achieve higher divestiture returns than matched non-targets. Activists curtail empire building through the removal of empire building chief executive officers (CEOs), compensation based incentives, and appointment of new board members. Our findings highlight an important channel through which activists improve efficiency and create shareholder value.","['Nickolay Gantchev', 'Merih Sevilir', 'Anil Shivdasani']","['Shareholder activism','Corporate governance','Mergers and acquisitions','Empire building','Hedge funds']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301689,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,2
Capital gains taxation and funding for start-ups,"We examine how capital gains taxes affect investment in private start-up (i.e., pre-IPO) firms. Using data on capital raised in individual funding rounds, we estimate the effect of the 2010 SBJA, which implemented a full exemption from federal capital gains tax on the sale of qualified shares. Because of the resulting higher expected after-tax returns, we hypothesize and find evidence consistent with this capital gains tax reduction increasing the amount of investment in start-up firms per funding round by about 12%. The effect is stronger in start-up firms that are likely to have greater administrative capacity. We estimate that about one-third of the tax benefit is captured by investors.","['Alexander Edwards', 'Maximilian Todtenhaupt']","['Capital gains taxes','Start-ups','Tax capitalization']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301768,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,2
When low beats high: Riding the sales seasonality premium,"This paper examines whether predictable seasonal patterns in firm fundamentals generate time variation in stock returns. Our findings indicate that stock returns are counterseasonal. Specifically, a long-short strategy of buying low-sales season stocks and shorting high-sales season stocks produces an annual alpha of 8.4% (14.5% over the last decade). This seasonal effect has a relatively high Sharpe ratio and occurs independently of previously documented seasonal anomalies. We analyze several possible hypotheses for this phenomenon.","['Gustavo Grullon', 'Yamil Kaba', 'Alexander N˙Òez-Torres']","['Asset pricing','Return predictability','Seasonality','Market efficiency','Product markets']",[],November,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301707,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,2
CoCo issuance and bank fragility,"The promise of contingent convertible capital securities (CoCos) as a îbail-inî solution has been the subject of considerable theoretical analysis and debate, but little is known about their effects in practice. We undertake the first comprehensive empirical analysis of bank CoCo issues, a market segment that comprises over 730 instruments totaling $521 billion. Four main findings emerge: (1) the propensity to issue a CoCo is higher for larger and better capitalized banks; (2) CoCo issues result in a statistically significant decline in issuersí CDS spread, indicating that they generate risk-reduction benefits and lower costs of debt (this is especially true for CoCos that convert into equity, have mechanical triggers, and are classified as Additional Tier 1 instruments); (3) CoCos with only discretionary triggers do not have a significant impact on CDS spreads; and (4) CoCo issues have no statistically significant impact on stock prices, except for principal write-down CoCos with a high trigger level, which have a positive effect.",[],"['Contingent convertible capital securities','Bail-in','Bank fragility']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301756,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Fund tradeoffs,"We study tradeoffs among active mutual fundsí characteristics. In both our equilibrium model and the data, funds with larger size, lower expense ratio, and higher turnover hold more-liquid portfolios. Portfolio liquidity, a concept introduced here, depends not only on the liquidity of the portfolioís holdings but also on the portfolioís diversification. We also confirm other model-predicted tradeoffs. Larger funds are cheaper. Larger and cheaper funds are less active, based on our new measure of activeness. Better-diversified funds hold less-liquid stocks; they are also larger and cheaper, and they trade more. These tradeoffs provide novel evidence of diseconomies of scale in active management.",[],"['Fund tradeoffs','Fund characteristics','Portfolio liquidity','Diversification']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301720,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Asset pricing: A tale of night and day,"The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) performs poorly overall, as market risk (beta) is weakly related to 24-h returns. This is because stock prices behave very differently with respect to their sensitivity to beta when markets are open for trading versus when they are closed. Stock returns are positively related to beta overnight, whereas returns are negatively related to beta during the trading day. These day-night relations hold for beta-sorted portfolios and individual stocks in the US and internationally as well as for industry and book-to-market portfolios and cash flow and discount rate beta-sorted portfolios. In addition to the change in slope of returns with respect to beta, the implied risk-free rate differs significantly between night and day. Consistent with this, returns on US Treasury futures differ significantly between night and day.",[],"['Asset pricing','CAPM','Risk-free rate','Day-night']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301732,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Financial intermediation and capital reallocation,"To understand the link between financial intermediation activities and the real economy, we build a general equilibrium model in which agency frictions in the financial sector affect the efficiency of capital reallocation across firms and generate aggregate economic fluctuations. We develop a recursive policy iteration approach to fully characterize the nonlinear equilibrium dynamics and the off-steady-state crisis behavior. In our model, adverse shocks to agency frictions exacerbate capital misallocation and manifest themselves as variations in total factor productivity at the aggregate level. Our model endogenously generates countercyclical volatility in the aggregate time series and countercyclical dispersion in the marginal product of capital and asset returns in the cross-section.",[],"['Financial intermediation','Capital misallocation','Volatility','Crisis','Limited enforcement']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301847,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Bank net worth and frustrated monetary policy,"I present a model in which bank net worth determines both loan market competition and monetary transmission to firm borrowing rates. In the model, banks are local monopolists for borrowers near them. When they are flush with equity, banks expand their lending, compete for customers at the edges of their markets, and pass through changes in the monetary policy rate to their loan rates. When they lose substantial equity, banks consolidate, retreat from rivalry, and frustrate monetary transmission. The model explains why interest rate pass-through weakens after financial crises. Its predictions are consistent with several facts about bank-to-firm lending.",[],"['Banking','Monetary policy','Monopolistic competition']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301744,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
The price effects of liquidity shocks: A study of the SECís tick size experiment,"Do stock prices of publicly listed companies respond to changes in transaction costs? Using the SECís pilot program that increased the tick size for approximately 1,200 randomly chosen stocks, we find a stock price decrease between 1.75% and 3.2% for small spread stocks affected by the larger tick size relative to a control group. We find that the increase in the present value of transaction costs accounts for a small percentage of the price decrease. We study channels of price variation due to changes in expected returns: information risk, investor horizon, and liquidity risk. The evidence suggests that trading frictions affect the cost of capital.",[],"['Tick size pilot','Liquidity','Information risk','Price efficiency','News response','Investor horizon','Liquidity risk','Liquidity premium','Cost of capital','JOBS Act','SEC']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20301884,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
"Dealersí insurance, market structure, and liquidity","We develop a parsimonious model to study the effect of regulations aimed at reducing counterparty risk on the structure of over-the-counter securities markets. We find that such regulations promote entry of dealers, thus fostering competition and lowering spreads. Greater competition, however, has an indirect negative effect on market-making profitability. General equilibrium effects imply that more competition can distort incentives of all dealers to invest in efficient technologies ex ante and so can cause a social welfare loss. Our results are consistent with empirical findings on the effects of post-crisis regulations and with the opposition of some market participants to those regulations.",[],"['Liquidity','Dealers','Insurance','Central counterparties']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X2030180X,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Collateral constraints and asset prices,"We study the effects of collateral constraints in an economy populated by investors with nonpledgeable labor incomes and heterogeneous preferences and beliefs. We show that these constraints inflate stock prices and generate spikes and crashes in price-dividend ratios and volatilities, clustering of volatilities, and leverage cycles. They also lead to substantial decreases in interest rates and increases in Sharpe ratios when investors are anxious about hitting constraints due to production crises in the economy. Furthermore, stock prices have large collateral premiums over nonpledgeable incomes. We derive asset prices and stationary distributions of the investorsí consumption shares in closed form.",[],"['Collateral','Heterogeneous preferences','Disagreement','Asset prices','Stationary equilibrium']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301793,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
The effect of minority veto rights on controller pay tunneling,"A central challenge in the regulation of controlled firms is curbing rent extraction by controllers. As independent directors and fiduciary duties are often insufficient, some jurisdictions give minority shareholders veto rights over related-party transactions. To assess these rightsí effectiveness, we exploit a 2011 Israeli reform that gave minority shareholders veto rights over related-party transactions, including the pay of controllers and their relatives (ìcontroller executivesî). We find that the reform curbed controller-executive pay and led some controller executives to resign or go with little or no pay in circumstances suggesting their pay would be rejected. These findings suggest that minority veto rights can be an effective corporate governance tool.",[],"['Controlling shareholders','Executive compensation','Related-party transactions','Shareholder voting','Tunneling']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301823,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Time-varying demand for lottery: Speculation ahead of earnings announcements,"Investor preferences for holding speculative assets are likely to be more pronounced ahead of firmsí earnings announcements, probably because of lower inventory costs and immediate payoffs or because of enhanced investor attention. We show that the demand for lottery-like stocks is stronger ahead of earnings announcements, leading to a price run-up for these stocks. In sharp contrast to the standard underperformance of lottery-like stocks, lottery-like stocks outperform non-lottery stocks by about 52 basis points in the 5-day window ahead of earnings announcements. However, this return spread is reversed by 80 basis points in the 5-day window after the announcements. Moreover, this inverted-V-shaped pattern on cumulative return spreads is more pronounced among firms with a greater retail order imbalance, among firms with low institutional ownership, and in regions with a stronger gambling propensity, and it is also robust after controlling for past 12-month returns and various proxies for investor attention.",[],"['Speculation','Lottery','Earnings announcements','Skewness']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301835,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Persuasion in relationship finance,"After initial investments, relationship financiers routinely observe interim information about projects before continuing financing them. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs produce information endogenously and issue securities to incumbent insider and competitive outsider investors. In such persuasion games with differentially informed receivers and contingent transfers, entrepreneursí endogenous experimentation reduces insidersí information monopoly but impedes relationship formation through an ìinformation production hold-up.î Insidersí information production and interim competition mitigate this hold-up and jointly explain empirical links between competition and relationship lending. Optimal contracts restore first-best outcomes using convertible securities for insiders and residuals for outsiders. Our findings are robust under various extensions and alternative specifications.",[],"['Bayesian persuasion','Experimentation','Hold-up','Information design','Relationship lending','Security design','Venture capital']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301859,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Policy uncertainty and corporate credit spreads,"We find a significant positive relation between changes in policy uncertainty and changes in credit spreads. Macroeconomic conditions, including general uncertainty, do not explain this result, which also holds when we use instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues. The impact of policy uncertainty is greater for firms that operate in regulation-intensive industries, face high tax rates, or are dependent on government spending. It is also stronger for firms that engage in political activities or rely on external financing. We conclude that policy uncertainty has a significant effect on firmsí borrowing costs, with exposure to government policies representing an important channel.",[],"['Credit spreads','Policy uncertainty','Regulation']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20301872,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
Do people feel less at risk? Evidence from disaster experience,"Past studies typically have focused on whether people perceive more rare risk after experiencing catastrophic disasters. We show that people can also feel less risk with unexpected lucky disaster experience. By exploring a novel identification strategy based on householdsí expectations, we find that households perceive less (more) risk when they experience disasters that have lower (higher) fatalities than what was expected. This opposite experience effect of rare disasters is substantial. A one standard deviation increase in the negative (positive) experience shock is associated with a 1.71% decrease (a 1.31% increase) in the life insurance-to-portfolio ratio. We discuss three possible mechanisms to account for our empirical findings: incomplete information learning, salience theory, and change in risk preferences.",[],"['Disaster experiences','Risk perceptions','Incomplete information learning','Salience theory','Risk preferences']",[],December,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X2030177X,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,138,3
