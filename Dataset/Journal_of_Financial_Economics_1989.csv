Proxy contests and the governance of publicly held corporations,"Analysis of 60 proxy contests for seats on the boards of exchange-listed firms during 1978–1985 shows that three years after the contest less than one-fifth of the sample firms remain independent, publicly held corporations run by the same management team. Proxy contests are typically followed by managerial resignations, even when dissidents fail to obtain a majority of board seats, and are often followed by sale or liquidation of the firm. The average stockholder wealth gains associated with proxy contests are largely attributable to gains by companies in which dissident activity leads to sale or liquidation.","['Harry DeAngelo', 'Linda DeAngelo']",[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X89900044,Journal of Financial Economics,1989,23,1
The rise in takeover premiums,"Cash tender, cash merger, and stock merger takeover premiums for 1974–1985 are approximately bouble those for 1963–1973. Cash tender repurchase premiums also rose in 1974. Thse upward shifts remain after we control for the business cycle and a possible time trend in premiums. The shift in both takeover and repurchase premiums in 1973–1974 is consistent with some event not unique to the takeover market affecting the capital markets in 1973–1974. We also investigate the possible effect on takeover premiums of the 1986 Williams Act and conclude that it does not explain the premium increase.","['Kevin S Nathan', ""Terrence B O'Keefe""]",[],[],June,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X8990007X,Journal of Financial Economics,1989,23,1
Decentralized investment banking,Discount dividend-reinvestment and stock-purchase plans allow shareholders to capture part of the underwriting fees incurred in new stock offerings and save sponsoring firms some of the usual underwriting costs. We tested the degree to which individual investors can profitably serve this investment banking function by implementing simple investment/trading strategies designed to capture the discounts and distribute the shares in the market. The large profits earned by our strategies raise serious questions about why it takes firms so long to raise the target level of capital and why many eligible shareholders do not participate in these discount plans.,"['Myron S.

Signalling by underpricing in the IPO market,"Empirical evidence suggests the existence of ‘hot-issue’ markets for initial public offerings: in certain periods and in certain industries, new issues are underpriced and rationing occurs. This paper develops a model consistent with this observation, which assumes the firm itself best knows its prospects. In certain circumstances, firms with the most favorable prospects find it optimal to signal their type by underpricing their initial issue of shares, and investors know that only the best can recoup the cost of this signal from subsequent issues.","['Franklin Allen', 'Gerald R.

Equity valuation effects of forming master limited partnerships,"Equity valuation effects of decisions by corporations to shift assets to master limited partnerships (MLPs) are examined for the period 1982–1987. Positive average abnormal returns are found for (1) total conversions of corporations to MLPs (5.89%), (2) rollouts of subsets of assets by distribution of MLP equity claims to parent-firm shareholders (6.41%), and (3) rollouts of subsets of assets by public sale of MLP equity claims (2.41%). The positive effects are consistent with tax advantages, reduction in free cash flow, and information signaling. The positive effects for rollouts of subsets of assets are also consistent with reductions in information asymmetry and improvements in asset management.","['William T. Moore', 'Donald G.

Business conditions and expected returns on stocks and bonds,"Expected returns on common stocks and long-term bonds contain a term or maturity premium that has a clear business-cycle pattern (low near peaks, high near troughs). Expected returns also contain a risk premium that is related to longer-term aspects of business conditions. The variation through time in this premium is stronger for low-grade bonds than for high-grade bonds and stronger for stocks than for bonds. The general message is that expected returns are lower when economic conditions are strong and higher when conditions are weak.","['Eugene F. Fama', 'Kenneth R.

"Managerial performance, Tobin's Q, and the gains from successful tender offers","For a sample of successful tender offers, we find that the shareholders of high q bidders gain significantly more than the shareholders of low q bidders. In general, the shareholders of low q targets benefit more from takeovers than the shareholders of high q targets. Typical bidders have persistently low q ratios prior to the acquisition announcement while target q ratios decline significantly over the five years before the tender offer. Our results are consistent with the view that takeovers of poorly managed targets by well-managed bidders have higher bidder, target, and total gains.","['Larry H.P. Lang', 'RenéM. Stulz', 'Ralph A.

Campeau's acquisition of federated,"I analyze the acquisition of Federated Department Stores by Campeau Corporation and find that after the purchase the value of Federated assets increased by more than $1.8 billion. Federated and Campeau defaulted on the debt used to finance the acquisition because Campeau paid a premium of $3.4 billion for Federated, an overpayment of $1.6 billion, financed 97% of the purchase with debt, and did not have enough other assets to make up the shortfall. The Federated purchase illustrates that a highly leveraged transaction can increase value, but still not be able to make its debt payments.",['Steven N.

"Information disclosure, method of payment, and takeover premiums","In 1970, France introduced disclosure rules governing public tender offers without changing an existing four-week minimum offer period. We document a substantial increase in total offer premiums thereafter. Post-1970 premiums are also significantly higher in public than in private tender offers, where information disclosure is not required, and in all-cash than in all-stock offers. The impact of the payment method is evident in minority buyouts as well as in offers for voting control. The component of the total premium reflecting the value of the option to tender appears to be unaffected by either disclosure regulations or the payment method.","['B.Espen Eckbo', 'Herwig Langohr']",[],[],1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X89900524,Journal of Financial Economics,1989,24,2
Equity ownership concentration and firm value,"In contrast to the negative average abnormal returns accompanying the announcement of a public offering of securities, the announcement of a private sale of equity is accompanied by a 4.5% average abnormal return.

A critique of latent variable tests of asset pricing models,"Latent variable tests of asset pricing models make assumptions about the joint distribution of observable returns and unobservable benchmark returns. These tests can falsely accept models when a mean-variance efficient portfolio other than the benchmark satisfies the distributional assumptions imposed on the benchmark portfolio. Also, because the assumptions are untestable, there is no way to discover whether a model is being rejected because the assumptions are false. Without these assumptions, however, latent variable tests can be viewed only as tests of distributional hypotheses about mean-variance efficient portfolios of unknown composition.",['Simon M.

Nonstationary expected returns,"Recent evidence reveals significant negative serial correlation in aggregate (market-wide) stock returns. We extend this result to relative (market-adjusted) returns, demonstrating negative serial correlation in five-year returns. We then test two competing explanations: (1) market mispricing and (2) changing expected returns in an efficient market. The tests are conducted using the capital asset pricing model to estimate relative returns. The evidence suggests that negative serial correlation in relative returns is due almost entirely to variation in relative risks, and therefore expected relative returns, through time. We document substantial relative risk shifts, particularly for extreme-performing stocks.","['Ray Ball', 'S.P.

Drawing inferences from statistics based on multiyear asset returns,Researchers investigating the possibility of mean reversion in stock prices with statistics based on multiyear returns have noted difficulties in drawing inferences from these statistics because the approximating asymptotic distributions perform poorly. We develop an alternative asymptotic distribution theory for statistics involving multiyear returns. These distributions differ markedly from those implied by the conventional theory. The alternative theory provides substantially better approximations to the relevant finite-sample distributions. It also leads to empirical inferences much less at odds with the hypothesis of no mean reversion.,"['Matthew Richardson', 'James H.

"Trading patterns, bid-ask spreads, and estimated security returns","Returns computed with closing bid or ask prices that may not represent ‘true’ prices introduce measurement error into portfolio returns if investor buying and selling display systematic patterns. This paper finds systematic tendencies for closing prices to be recorded at the bid in December and at the ask in early January. After changing bid and ask prices are controlled for. this pattern results in large portfolio returns on the two trading days surrounding the end of the year, especially for low-price stocks. Other temporal return patterns (e.g. weekend and holiday effects) are also related to systematic trading patterns.",['Donald B.

Forward and futures prices in a general equilibrium monetary model,"Risk premiums on dollar-denominated forward and futures contracts depend on risk attitudes, consumption parameters, and the stochastic structure of money and outputs. Pure monetary uncertainty leads to forward market backwardation; pure output uncertainty leads to contango under high risk aversion. Similar conclusions hold for futures contracts if neither money nor output show negative serial correlation. The conflicting effects of money and output shocks can imply that each contract switches between contango and backwardation, that one contract shows contango when the other shows backwardation, and that capital losses are expected on one contract when capital gains are expected on the other.","['Leslie Young', 'Glenn W.

"Organizational form, share transferability, and firm performance","The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA) established thirteen diffusely held profit-seeking corporations that were saddled with unusual organization restrictions, the most important of which is that stock cannot be traded. We find that these firms are characterized by poor financial performance, a high incidence of control contests, and high turnover among directors and managers. These and other findings about ANCSA firms are consistent, overall, with the theory of the firm. The results illustrate the importance of organizational form in accomplishing productive activities, and particularly the importance of freely transferrable shares for organizational efficiency in diffusely held corporations.","['Jonathan M.

Tax attributes as determinants of shareholder gains in corporate acquisitions,"The paper provides evidence that tax attributes of target firms are significant in explaining the abnormal returns to shareholders of both target and acquiring firms following acquisition announcements. The most prominent tax attribute in tax-free acquisitions is the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits due to expire. The most important tax attribute in taxable acquisitions is the step-up in the acquired assets' basis. The findings also suggest that tax considerations motivate acquisitions.

We document beta sensitivity to the return interval. Evidence from cross-sectional regressions of returns on monthly and annual betas is inconsistent with beta changes stemming only from the higher standard errors of the longer-interval betas.

Shareholder wealth effects of corporate takeovers,"This paper examines the effects of over 1,800 U.K. takeovers on shareholder wealth in the period 1955–1985. It shows that around the merger announcement date targets gain 25 to 30 percent and bidders earn zero or modest gains. The U.K. data allow independent tests of many issues addressed in studies of U.S. takeovers. Target gains are higher in the U.K. after 1968, suggesting that increases in U.S. target gains at the same time may not be attributable to the Williams Act.

Wealth effects of going private for senior securities,"This paper investigates effects of going-private buyout proposals made from 1974 to 1985 on the value and default risk of convertible and nonconvertible debt and preferred stock securities. Positive average price reactions are documented for public convertible securities and nonconvertible preferred stock; many of these issues are redeemed as part of the buyout. Most nonconvertible debt securities remain outstanding without renegotiation after buyouts, and minimal average price reactions are documented for public nonconvertible debt.

The design of securities,"This paper investigates the determinants of security design. We consider the assignment of both cash flows and voting rights, focusing on corporate control. We postulate that a conflict of interest exists between contestants for control and outside investors.

Security design is a tool for resolving these conflicts and maximizing firm value. Our main result is that a single voting security is optimal.","['Milton Harris', 'Artur Raviv']",[],[],1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/0304405X89900482,Journal of Financial Economics,1989,24,2

Transferable put rights make the put option, which is implicit in a tender offer, marketable.

Unlike previous researchers, we distinguished between new bank loans and loan renewals. For new loans, the excess stock return for borrowers around the loan announcement is not significantly different from zero. For favorable loan revisions, the excess return is significantly positive: for unfavorable revisions, it is significantly negative. We interpret these results to imply that banks play an important role as transmitters of information in capital markets, but new bank loans per se do not communicate information.","['Scott L.

In the three years after the buyout, these companies experience increases in operating income (before depreciation), decreases in capital expenditures, and increases in net cash flow. Consistent with the operating changes, the mean and median increases in market value (adjusted for market returns) are 96% and 77% from two months before the buyout announcement to the post-buyout sale.

On average, the announcements are associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in the stock prices of firms incorporated in the state and of large firms headquartered in the state. The stock-price effects are concentrated in firms without preexisting firm-level takeover defenses. Firms with prior defenses have no significant stock-price reactions.","['Jonathan M.

How investment bankers determine the offer price and allocation of new issues,"We investigate how investment bankers use indications of interest from their client investors to price and allocate new issues. We model the process as an auction constructed to induce asymmetrically informed investors to reveal what they know to the underwriter. The analysis yields a number of empirical implications, including that new issues will be underpriced and that distributional priority will be given to an underwriter's regular investors. We also find that tension between an underwriter's propensity to presell an issue and an issuing firm's desire to obtain maximum proceeds affects the type of underwriting contract chosen.","['Lawrence M.

Triggering the 1987 stock market crash,"We present evidence that a tax bill containing antitakeover provisions proposed by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee on October 13, 1987 and approved by the Committee on October 15 was the fundamental economic event causing the greater than 10% decline in the stock market on October 14–16, which arguably triggered the October 19 crash. The bill, which eventually passed without most of the antitakeover provisions, would have limited the deductibility of interest on debt incurred to finance corporate takeovers, leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations, and imposed other restrictions on hostile takeovers.","['Mark L.

Voluntary conversion of convertible securities and the optimal call strategy,"We provide an explanation of why convertibles are called long after the conversion value exceeds the call price. Delaying the call benefits the firm if enough investors are expected to delay their voluntary conversions. Consistent with this theory, we document that a substantial number of investors do not voluntarily convert when the common dividend exceeds the convertible's dividend plus its premium over conversion value. We find that firms would not have increased common stock returns by switching to the strategy of calling to force conversion as soon as possible. Surprisingly, we find that convertible preferreds frequently sell below conversion value.","['Kenneth B. Dunn', 'Kenneth M.

Dividend announcements,"We test the cash flow signalling and free cash flow/overinvestment explanations of the impact of dividend announcements on stock prices. We use Tobin's Q ratios less than unity to designate overinvestors. The average return associated with announcements of large dividend changes is significantly larger for firms with Q's less than unity than for other firms. This evidence, the results of further tests involving a finer partition of the data, and an analysis of changes in analysts' earning forecasts surrounding dividend announcements support the overinvestment hypothesis over the cash flow signalling hypothesis.","['Larry H.P.
